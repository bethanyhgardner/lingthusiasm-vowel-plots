1,L: Welcome to Lingthusiasm a podcast that's,3190.0,6759.0
1,enthusiastic about linguistics,6760.0,9218.0
1,I'm Lauren Gawne.,9219.0,11319.0
1,G: and I'm Gretchen McCulloch and today we're going to be talking about,11320.0,12399.0
1,universal language and why it doesn't work,12400.0,14829.0
1,but first a little bit about what Lingthusiasm is,14830.0,16899.0
1,L: So i guess the important,16900.0,19419.0
1,thing is to unpack 'a podcast that,19420.0,21339.0
1,enthusiastic about linguistics',21340.0,23979.0
1,G: yeah we chose our tagline because we're here to,23980.0,26979.0
1,explore interesting things that language,26980.0,29109.0
1,has to offer and especially what looking,29110.0,31419.0
1,at language from linguistics perspective,31420.0,33038.0
1,can tell us about how language works,33039.0,34689.0
1,L: both of its have blogs where we do a,34690.0,37808.0
1,fair amount of that but that's a fairly,37809.0,39428.0
1,solitary enterprise and we wanted to,39429.0,42218.0
1,take the opportunity to have more of a,42219.0,44018.0
1,conversation something that's a little,44019.0,45518.0
1,less disembodied,45519.0,48998.0
1,G: and we like that podcasts make you feel like part of a,48999.0,49808.0
1,conversation and there's a certain genre,49809.0,52029.0
1,of linguist conversation that we think,52030.0,53768.0
1,non-linguists don't get to listen in on,53769.0,55328.0
1,enough where we just are very excited,55329.0,57248.0
1,about all the things that happened in linguistics,57249.0,60308.0
1,L: and there's general kind of,60309.0,62558.0
1,nerdy and enthusiasm that you can,62559.0,65408.0
1,often get like a glimpse of this when,65409.0,66969.0
1,linguist interviews but the chance to,66970.0,69399.0
1,have a chat to another linguist is,69400.0,70719.0
1,something that we get to of a coffee but,70720.0,73659.0
1,we know people don't always get to hear,73660.0,75069.0
1,that perspective and so that's what this,75070.0,76659.0
1,podcast is all about,76660.0,78939.0
1,G: yeah so you can think of it as are sitting down over,78940.0,80289.0
1,coffee and talking about linguistics,80290.0,82149.0
1,[segment transtion music playing],82150.0,92379.0
1,G: one thing that often comes up when we're,92380.0,96158.0
1,talking about languages and linguistics,96159.0,98258.0
1,is wouldn't it be great if everyone just,98259.0,102038.0
1,spoke one language and there's two,102039.0,104379.0
1,things that come with that there's the,104380.0,106809.0
1,idea that could be feasible to make,106810.0,108489.0
1,everybody speak one language and if so,108490.0,110408.0
1,what should that language be and secondly is the,110409.0,112749.0
1,promise that we associate with what it,112750.0,116169.0
1,would even mean for everyone to speak the language even,116170.0,118118.0
1,if that is feasible so we're going to,118119.0,119709.0
1,kind of break down those two pieces,119710.0,121959.0
1,of the wish for everyone to speak,121960.0,124029.0
1,the language. What would that look like,124030.0,125288.0
1,and would it even work the way it's advertised,125289.0,127239.0
1,L: and it seems to be an idea,127240.0,129279.0
1,that people continue to revisit and,129280.0,131439.0
1,revisit in different forms and different,131440.0,133149.0
1,ideas that we're going to touch on a few,133150.0,134738.0
1,of those today but it's always this allure of,134739.0,136899.0
1,something that will be utopian or more,136900.0,139389.0
1,easier or if everyone just spoke the,139390.0,141399.0
1,same language then then they'd be world,141400.0,143229.0
1,peace because we'd all just get along,143230.0,144789.0
1,"G: yes, so preview",144790.0,146318.0
1,I'm not a fan of it. Ii'm on the record,146319.0,148449.0
1,have been called it the 'common language,148450.0,150068.0
1,equals piece fallacy' and I think it's,150069.0,152949.0
1,the seductive allure of like 'wouldn't be,152950.0,155708.0
1,greater if everyone just got along' like,155709.0,157689.0
1,the kind of Miss Universe wishing for,157690.0,159789.0
1,world peace thing I don't know that's,159790.0,162999.0
1,"the analogy I want, but yeah i'm not a fan of it",163000.0,165518.0
1,I think we're going to see why,165519.0,166929.0
1,L: this is definitely not like a debate style set up,166930.0,168909.0
1,today either i should happily say,168910.0,170919.0
1,that I agree and I'm perhaps more realistic,170920.0,173048.0
1,about the realities of humanity when,173049.0,176318.0
1,it comes to an idealistic concept like this,176319.0,178599.0
1,G: it has given rise to some,178600.0,180849.0
1,interesting stuff so let's use it as an,180850.0,183608.0
1,opportunity to talk about some of the,183609.0,184659.0
1,interesting stuff that the wish for a,184660.0,186279.0
1,common language has given us,186280.0,187539.0
1,"L: okay, definitely",187540.0,189669.0
1,G: one of the best-known endeavors to get everyone to speak a,189670.0,192399.0
1,common language and lead to peace on,192400.0,194619.0
1,Earth is Esperanto and Esperanto is,194620.0,197048.0
1,interesting because it's a conlang so it,197049.0,199509.0
1,was constructed to be a sort of neutral,199510.0,202599.0
1,language that would supposedly be easy,202600.0,204999.0
1,to learn and not reflective of any,205000.0,207789.0
1,particular nationality because it was,207790.0,209409.0
1,created to be this independent things,209410.0,211328.0
1,so wasn't like learning a language,211329.0,213039.0
1,associated with a particular country and then the,213040.0,215259.0
1,idea being that everyone can understand,215260.0,216879.0
1,each other and living in peace and,216880.0,218589.0
1,harmony and there's a couple of issues with,218590.0,220809.0
1,"different parts of this. For one, Esperanto is",220810.0,223869.0
1,not totally neutral,223870.0,225709.0
1,it borrows a lot of words from various,225710.0,227839.0
1,European languages and so it's a lot,227840.0,229849.0
1,easier to learn people who are already,229850.0,231199.0
1,speak European language than for,231200.0,233989.0
1,people who speak the language that's not,233990.0,236449.0
1,European,236450.0,237439.0
1,so it's not easy for everyone to learn,237440.0,239659.0
1,is easy for a particular group of people to learn.,239660.0,242089.0
1,L: so I've seen bits of Esperanto and I immediately,242090.0,243859.0
1,think of French that's being fed,243860.0,246139.0
1,through some kind of Italian filter and,246140.0,248809.0
1,then Spanish-ified. Like it definitely,248810.0,250669.0
1,has a strong Romance language kind of vibe to it.,250670.0,253309.0
1,G: it has a Romance kind of,253310.0,255469.0
1,look because it tends to have this kind,255470.0,257329.0
1,of consonant vowel sequences like,257330.0,259219.0
1,romance languages do but actually also,259220.0,260749.0
1,does have a lot of words from Slavic,260750.0,262849.0
1,languages and from Germanic languages as,262850.0,265129.0
1,well. So like the Esperanto word for dog,265130.0,267889.0
1,is something like 'hudo' which is a German,267890.0,270349.0
1,word like 'hound' it's not something like,270350.0,272329.0
1,'chien' or something like that.,272330.0,274159.0
1,L: the only Esperanto word I know is the word,274160.0,277129.0
1,'hotdogo' which is the Esperanto word,277130.0,279889.0
1,for hotdog,279890.0,280579.0
1,it's not 'hot hundo' or whatever it is,280580.0,282679.0
1,'hotdogo' is my one piece of Esperanto,282680.0,285319.0
1,G: but the Esperanto to word that I remember,285320.0,286789.0
1,"the best is 'kai' Kay-Ae-Ai, which is the word for 'and'",286790.0,289249.0
1,L: yeah G: so again you can see that's not,289250.0,291799.0
1,"very, it's not very Romance sounding",291800.0,293929.0
1,because it's not 'et' or 'a' or some version,293930.0,296659.0
1,some vowel-y thing (L: yep) and it's not,296660.0,299119.0
1,even Germanic sense because it's not 'and',299120.0,300859.0
1,or 'und'. 'Kai' is actually from Greek,300860.0,302779.0
1,Zamenhof,302780.0,303889.0
1,who's the guy who created Esperanto did,303890.0,305479.0
1,try to draw on multiple languages so 'kai',305480.0,307519.0
1,comes from Greek. I guess my personal,307520.0,309379.0
1,story with Esperanto is I tried learning,309380.0,311359.0
1,it when I was like 12.,311360.0,313409.0
1,L: I am so not surprised.,313410.0,315359.0
1,G: because I was that kid. I tried,315360.0,318079.0
1,learning it when I was like 12 because I,318080.0,319699.0
1,encountered this book about it on a,319700.0,322129.0
1,bookshelf because this back before i was,322130.0,324529.0
1,really using the internet very much and I,324530.0,326689.0
1,encountered a paperback book about,326690.0,327919.0
1,Esperanto and I was like oh yeah I'm,327920.0,329839.0
1,going to read this because I'd like to see,329840.0,330919.0
1,someone like you know putting out the,330920.0,332419.0
1,arguments for and against and it turned,332420.0,334489.0
1,out it was not a pros and cons book it,334490.0,336109.0
1,was literally a grammar or like a 'teach,336110.0,338059.0
1,"yourself Esperanto' book so I was like 'okay, fine'",338060.0,339979.0
1,i can't read the pros and cons maybe,339980.0,341039.0
1,I'll just learn it,341040.0,342399.0
1,"L: impeccable logic, yeah",342400.0,343379.0
1,G:this is what 12 year old Gretchen did when she,343380.0,345979.0
1,was encountering a language. And so I got,345980.0,347839.0
1,through chapter 1 which is how i learned,347840.0,349399.0
1,the word for 'and' and 'dog' and then I got to,349400.0,351859.0
1,chapter 2 and I learned that all of the,351860.0,354529.0
1,feminine forms were diminutive of the,354530.0,356539.0
1,masculine forms (L: ugh),356540.0,358189.0
1,so the word for men is like 'homo' or,358190.0,360799.0
1,something like Homo sapiens and then the,360800.0,362719.0
1,word for woman is 'homeno' (L: boo) which is,362720.0,365869.0
1,like '-ien' like the German -ine,365870.0,368479.0
1,suffix. Like in German you have Sprachwissenschaftler,368480.0,370519.0
1,which is a linguist,370520.0,372499.0
1,speech scientists and you have,372500.0,374539.0
1,Sprachwissenschaftlerin which is a,374540.0,376159.0
1,female speech scientist,376160.0,377039.0
1,L: I'm all ready to blow things up like so much for a,377040.0,379459.0
1,language of peace,379460.0,380659.0
1,G: yeah so first of all maybe this language,380660.0,383029.0
1,is peaceful but it's going to be a,383030.0,384109.0
1,sexist peace so i'm not sure if I'm into it,384110.0,386809.0
1,in fact I know I'm not into it,386810.0,388259.0
1,"L: yeah, fair enough",388260.0,388759.0
1,G: and secondly this just seems,388760.0,390349.0
1,uneconomical because as anybody who has,390350.0,392749.0
1,spoken Spanish or something knows,392750.0,394939.0
1,sometimes you really do want to be able,394940.0,396829.0
1,to distinguish between a group that's,396830.0,398929.0
1,gender mixed or gender neutral and a,398930.0,400789.0
1,group that is specifically only a plural of males.,400790.0,402649.0
1,So in Spanish you have a word like,402650.0,404869.0
1,'niño' which can mean 'boy' or 'child' whereas,404870.0,407989.0
1,'niña' means 'girl' but 'niños' can mean either,407990.0,410149.0
1,'boys' or 'children' so you have to do like,410150.0,411979.0
1,extra stuff you want to talk about a,411980.0,413899.0
1,group of boys specifically (L: right),413900.0,416149.0
1,so it's kind of uneconomical from a,416150.0,417919.0
1,linguistic perspective to have your,417920.0,419689.0
1,neutral word and your masculine word be,419690.0,421489.0
1,the same word because this is genuinely,421490.0,423589.0
1,a semantic distinction that's useful to,423590.0,424909.0
1,be able to make and Esperanto just can't do it,424910.0,426259.0
1,L: right,426260.0,426759.0
1,G: so it's a terrible,426760.0,428249.0
1,language for a bunch of reading and the,428250.0,429679.0
1,the main reason that I stopped when I,429680.0,431359.0
1,was 12 which I think was a great,431360.0,432739.0
1,decision on my part was that it was sexist.,432740.0,434149.0
1,L: So Zamenhof was like a complete idealist,434150.0,435949.0
1,G: he was a big idealist,435950.0,438709.0
1,so the name Esperanto itself means one,438710.0,441559.0
1,who hopes and this was his pseudonym,441560.0,443779.0
1,Dr. Esperanto. So he was really hoping,443780.0,446359.0
1,for kind of world peace and world,446360.0,448249.0
1,understanding which is very nice and I,448250.0,451039.0
1,think maybe because of his political,451040.0,452809.0
1,ideals that was really why people did,452810.0,455269.0
1,manage to learn Esperanto and it is kind,455270.0,457579.0
1,of one of the more successful common,457580.0,459439.0
1,languages,459440.0,460429.0
1,according to Wikipedia up to two million,460430.0,462709.0
1,people worldwide to varying degrees speak Esperanto,462710.0,466299.0
1,L: but is that just people like me who go 'hotdogs! yes!',466300.0,468939.0
1,G: yeah so I don't,468940.0,470209.0
1,know if like you and I count because we,470210.0,471679.0
1,know a few words of Esperanto or if you,471680.0,473269.0
1,have to be like a more dedicated,473270.0,474199.0
1,enthusiasts and some people have raised,474200.0,476359.0
1,their children speaking Esperanto so as,476360.0,478309.0
1,far as common languages go,478310.0,480229.0
1,it's had some success i but I've also,480230.0,482689.0
1,heard you know as a conlang that it's not,482690.0,485449.0
1,considered a very good conlang so if,485450.0,488478.0
1,you talk to conlangers and I know a few,488479.0,490579.0
1,conlangers there,490580.0,491659.0
1,is the kind of everyone's first conlang,491660.0,493459.0
1,which is pseudo-European everything,493460.0,495589.0
1,combined (L: right) that still inherits,495590.0,497959.0
1,a lot of the illogicalities of European,497960.0,500089.0
1,languages,500090.0,500719.0
1,that's what this is. So that's like a,500720.0,502189.0
1,stage 1 conlang and then a stage two conlang,502190.0,504499.0
1,is when you learn about all the,504500.0,505729.0
1,other stuff other languages do when you,505730.0,507049.0
1,try to make a language that does all of them,507050.0,508489.0
1,L: it has 48 cases and clicks an evidentials,508490.0,510709.0
1,G: yeah and ergativity and,510710.0,512839.0
1,like it just does every single weird,512840.0,514788.0
1,thing you can imagine from a language,514789.0,516288.0
1,like too many of them so it's ridiculously,516289.0,518809.0
1,complex and then like by the time you,518810.0,520848.0
1,get to your third conlang you've,520849.0,522348.0
1,learned the value of restraint and you,522349.0,524269.0
1,can really make a good conlang. This is,524270.0,525739.0
1,what I've been told. So apparently,525740.0,527449.0
1,Esperanto has all of the marks of a,527450.0,529039.0
1,first conlang the story I like the most,529040.0,531409.0
1,about Esperanto and its kind of,531410.0,533539.0
1,optimistic naivety. Was that there were a whole,533540.0,535459.0
1,bunch of people in commerce and stuff,535460.0,537409.0
1,who like 'Esperanto. Great idea.,537410.0,539269.0
1,Universal language.,539270.0,540529.0
1,Just tone down the optimism of world,540530.0,543049.0
1,peace because it would be really great,543050.0,544549.0
1,as like a commercial thing if we could,544550.0,546619.0
1,have international trade through this,546620.0,548509.0
1,unified language',548510.0,550939.0
1,G: so world capitalism instead of world peace,550940.0,551659.0
1,L: basically and they got so fed up they,551660.0,553849.0
1,broke off and created this language,553850.0,555409.0
1,called 'Ido' which I think means like,555410.0,557179.0
1,daughter or child language and then,557180.0,559849.0
1,basically it fell apart because they,559850.0,562519.0
1,failed to maintain the drive,562520.0,564529.0
1,G: they were insufficiently peaceful,564530.0,565939.0
1,L: they were insufficiently peaceful maybe there,565940.0,567319.0
1,is a kernel of Esperanto selling,567320.0,569509.0
1,itself is the universal language of peace,569510.0,571219.0
1,seems to have done a lot for its longevity,571220.0,572419.0
1,G: I kind of think of Esperanto,572420.0,574639.0
1,as with people who learn Esperanto is,574640.0,577309.0
1,kind of like couch surfers (L: right),577310.0,579349.0
1,you know people who joined like the,579350.0,580579.0
1,couch surfing web site and they meet,580580.0,582079.0
1,people from around the world and they,582080.0,583879.0
1,like sleep on each other's couches and,583880.0,585229.0
1,they really do like having experiences,585230.0,587449.0
1,that are like connected to the local,587450.0,589219.0
1,community (L: yeah),589220.0,589939.0
1,and I think that's very nice it's,589940.0,592069.0
1,just a pity that they're doing it with,592070.0,593179.0
1,such a terrible language,593180.0,594829.0
1,L: another language with someone tried to capture,594830.0,596359.0
1,this idea of universal communication but,596360.0,598639.0
1,from a completely different perspective,598640.0,599599.0
1,was Blissymbols or Blissymbolics,599600.0,602539.0
1,which were invented by a guy,602540.0,604849.0
1,his name was Charles Bliss but this was a name he,604850.0,607039.0
1,gave himself because he was Carl Blitz,607040.0,609679.0
1,and that didn't go down so well. He was,609680.0,611989.0
1,Jewish and so he was interned in the,611990.0,613639.0
1,Nazi camps and after he escaped the war,613640.0,616789.0
1,moved to Shanghai he changed his name to,616790.0,618619.0
1,Bliss because Blitz wasn't the the best,618620.0,621409.0
1,for a former German prisoner,621410.0,624049.0
1,G: was he also emphasizing this hope aspect,624050.0,625039.0
1,L: well i think it was part of,625040.0,626659.0
1,this bigger personal brand (G: yeah) that he,626660.0,628999.0
1,had is this like cheerful guy who was,629000.0,632328.0
1,going to solve the world's,632329.0,633648.0
1,communications problems through a,633649.0,635778.0
1,language that was all about visual,635779.0,638749.0
1,iconic imagery and so he started,638750.0,641148.0
1,learning Chinese was like oh the,641149.0,643189.0
1,character for 'man' in Chinese,643190.0,645979.0
1,characters looks like a man I'll just,645980.0,647778.0
1,take this to the full language and he,647779.0,650419.0
1,"and his wife spent all of his savings,",650420.0,652159.0
1,which is kind of a reoccurring story,652160.0,653719.0
1,"seemed to get with Conlangs, him and his",653720.0,656148.0
1,wife ploughed all their savings into him,656149.0,658008.0
1,inventing these Blissymbols as an,658009.0,661129.0
1,international ideographic written,661130.0,663018.0
1,"language, sent out copies of the book all",663019.0,665539.0
1,over the world thinking - this is,665540.0,667758.0
1,kind of the 1940s-50 - that he was going to,667759.0,670729.0
1,revolutionize the way people connected,670730.0,673068.0
1,and communicated and no one took it up,673069.0,676008.0
1,G: yeah i remember reading about listen,676009.0,677599.0
1,about Blissymbolics a couple years ago when I read,677600.0,679129.0
1,Arika Okrent's book The Land,679130.0,680778.0
1,"Invented Languages, but I think you just",680779.0,682338.0
1,read that book right?,682339.0,683448.0
1,L: yep and its really great,683449.0,685129.0
1,G: I really enjoyed it and I forgotten now most of what,685130.0,687229.0
1,she says about Blissymbolics but he tried to,687230.0,689388.0
1,do this but there were a couple kind of,689389.0,690799.0
1,tiny areas where he saw uptake right?,690800.0,692809.0
1,"L: yeah, so the idea went nowhere and then in",692810.0,695749.0
1,the seventies this woman in Canada who,695750.0,698179.0
1,worked with children who had either,698180.0,700189.0
1,physical or cognitive disabilities found,700190.0,703249.0
1,these symbols for her students to use to,703250.0,705469.0
1,communicate. Shirley McNaughton is this woman.,705470.0,707479.0
1,until that point all the children had,707480.0,709099.0
1,with this board full of symbols for like,709100.0,710778.0
1,"'toilet' or 'bed', really basic needs-based",710779.0,713539.0
1,communication and she was convinced that,713540.0,715429.0
1,these children could communicate more,715430.0,717049.0
1,but they're cerebral palsy would,717050.0,719419.0
1,prevent them from speaking so she set,719420.0,721669.0
1,out the symbols and use them as a way to,721670.0,724009.0
1,teach these children to communicate so,724010.0,727309.0
1,she'd have the symbol for a,727310.0,728688.0
1,person and the symbol for bed and then,728689.0,731599.0
1,the symbol for photos or something and,731600.0,734239.0
1,and the children were together like I,734240.0,735948.0
1,had a dream last night in something,735949.0,737629.0
1,they've never been able to communicate,737630.0,738679.0
1,people and it really took off in the,738680.0,741739.0
1,organization she was working in Canada.,741740.0,743989.0
1,And then it started spreading after,743990.0,745999.0
1,sitting on a shelf for decades unused,746000.0,748249.0
1,you finally have someone using them to,748250.0,750138.0
1,communicate with people who couldn't,750139.0,751458.0
1,"communicate before, it was really",751459.0,752869.0
1,powerful. And then Charles Bliss was still,752870.0,755539.0
1,alive and that's like there's just no,755540.0,757849.0
1,way to tell,757850.0,758639.0
1,story - I mean Arika Okrent does tell,758640.0,760559.0
1,"the story really beautifully, but I just",760560.0,762599.0
1,can't tell in a way where Charles Bliss,762600.0,764369.0
1,doesn't sound like a jerk but he kind of,764370.0,766469.0
1,came into this situation and said you,766470.0,769679.0
1,can't teach the kids to use the symbols,769680.0,771509.0
1,like this because she was using English,771510.0,773429.0
1,grammar and in Sweden they were using,773430.0,775589.0
1,them with the children to move on to,775590.0,778439.0
1,Swedish so they were using them with,778440.0,779909.0
1,like Swedish word order and everywhere,779910.0,781949.0
1,they were bringing in variation to how,781950.0,783839.0
1,the symbols were used as a way to go,783840.0,785789.0
1,from like not communicating at all,785790.0,787379.0
1,communicating with Blissymbols to,787380.0,789269.0
1,communicating with words in the kids,789270.0,791279.0
1,languages and Bliss said you're ruining the,791280.0,793559.0
1,universality of these symbols,793560.0,795929.0
1,"G: Like, so much for helping children",795930.0,797519.0
1,no we can't do that,797520.0,799889.0
1,L: no we can't help the children we need to maintain,799890.0,802109.0
1,the authenticity of these Blissymbols,802110.0,805619.0
1,G: yeah this guy really seems like a jerk,805620.0,807599.0
1,L: in the end they ended up settling for like,807600.0,809579.0
1,an absolute mass of money for him to,809580.0,811799.0
1,"give them the rights to use Blissymbols,",811800.0,813359.0
1,like it was just horrible that you would,813360.0,814949.0
1,go from being like 'I'm all about,814950.0,816419.0
1,communication and encouraging people to,816420.0,819089.0
1,communicate' to 'you're not using my,819090.0,821369.0
1,invention properly so give me lots of money',821370.0,823199.0
1,G: yeah,823200.0,823889.0
1,"the other thing I think is, because,",823890.0,825089.0
1,I mean it's not like Blissymbols,825090.0,826349.0
1,had caught on elsewhere (L: nope),826350.0,828209.0
1,and I think that kind of speaks to this hope this,828210.0,830219.0
1,kind of seductive hope especially when,830220.0,831839.0
1,it comes to visual communication even,831840.0,833699.0
1,beyond auditory communication that if,833700.0,836009.0
1,only we could just like get the right,836010.0,838379.0
1,graphic designer we could just kind of,838380.0,840089.0
1,think this through,840090.0,841559.0
1,we could figure out ways to just,841560.0,843419.0
1,intuitively represent every single,843420.0,845609.0
1,possible meaning in an immediately,845610.0,847289.0
1,obvious sequence of little pictures that,847290.0,850139.0
1,all humans will understand instantly and you,850140.0,851819.0
1,won't have to learn anything and I get,851820.0,854009.0
1,this when it comes to emoji a lot because,854010.0,855809.0
1,I do a lot of emoji interviews and stuff and some,855810.0,857399.0
1,people say 'oh yeah emoji they're this,857400.0,858839.0
1,universal language that you can,858840.0,860129.0
1,understand immediately' and I think it's,860130.0,862589.0
1,a similar problem that there's a lot in,862590.0,865049.0
1,emoji that is culturally specific or,865050.0,867599.0
1,that is not universally understandable,867600.0,869849.0
1,and there's also a lot of meanings you,869850.0,871829.0
1,can't convey an emoji because they aren't,871830.0,873779.0
1,very easily picture-able,873780.0,875519.0
1,L: it's like those times that people are like 'this thing,875520.0,877349.0
1,got translated into emoji' and you're like,877350.0,879539.0
1,'great translate it back out of emoji,879540.0,881399.0
1,why don't you?',881400.0,882539.0
1,G: yeah you translate something into,882540.0,883919.0
1,emoji and then when you translate it,883920.0,886169.0
1,back it completely loses its meaning or you,886170.0,888179.0
1,have to already understand what the,888180.0,889679.0
1,source text was. Tthe other thing is,889680.0,891179.0
1,people sometimes have,891180.0,892289.0
1,a challenge where they'll communicate,892290.0,893698.0
1,just in emoji for a day or a week or a,893699.0,897088.0
1,month or something and they all come,897089.0,898768.0
1,back and they're like' yeah you know it,898769.0,900388.0
1,was pretty easy to convey if I was happy,900389.0,902159.0
1,or sad but it was really hard to say,902160.0,904229.0
1,like actual sentences about things going,904230.0,906539.0
1,on in the world or ideas that I had',906540.0,908278.0
1,because - my favorite one is someone tried,908279.0,911879.0
1,to do this and they said at the end 'I,911880.0,913948.0
1,was missing grammar' I said 'thank you',913949.0,916469.0
1,because that's what emoji don't have,916470.0,918599.0
1,L: or sometimes you find that people do -,918600.0,921299.0
1,you find like temporary emergent,921300.0,923219.0
1,communicative norms that will arise in,923220.0,926099.0
1,these contexts where people are trying,926100.0,927719.0
1,to use things,927720.0,928948.0
1,G: yeah so for example one of the issues,928949.0,931349.0
1,that comes up with emoji is how do you,931350.0,934049.0
1,convey 'I' as in the subject of a sentence?,934050.0,936958.0
1,you know 'i would like you to do this' or,936959.0,939299.0
1,'I'm going to the store now' and so what,939300.0,941999.0
1,people will sometimes do is they'll pick,942000.0,943528.0
1,an emoji like a person emoji that looks,943529.0,945448.0
1,"kind of like them and they will say 'okay great,",945449.0,947099.0
1,this one stands for me' you know so they'll pick,947100.0,948989.0
1,the man or the woman they will put the,948990.0,950189.0
1,skin tone modifier on it and like,950190.0,951809.0
1,'okay that stands for me' but the only,951810.0,953698.0
1,reason that the other person knows,953699.0,956159.0
1,you're using that to stand for you is,956160.0,957419.0
1,because you've developed this convention,957420.0,958799.0
1,otherwise it could be a person who looks,958800.0,960809.0
1,like this who is not necessarily me,960810.0,962909.0
1,who does this,962910.0,963599.0
1,and this is a pretty basic concept that,963600.0,965129.0
1,we just have a massive difficulty,965130.0,967078.0
1,communicating with emoji,967079.0,968759.0
1,"L: and we also are really, I mean we're not lazy, we just use",968760.0,970679.0
1,the linguistic structures that we have,970680.0,972208.0
1,of course it's 'person' and then 'bus',972209.0,974489.0
1,because English is 'I am on the bus',974490.0,977729.0
1,"G: right, but in other languages you can have like",977730.0,979439.0
1,"'bus, I am on it' or something like that",979440.0,982078.0
1,L: I enjoy whatever anyone's like 'look we,982079.0,983578.0
1,"made sentences in emoji', I love",983579.0,985138.0
1,sitting there and like translating them,985139.0,986698.0
1,really badly,986699.0,987509.0
1,yeah I issued a challenge on Twitter a,987510.0,989939.0
1,while back which was if you want to,989940.0,991888.0
1,assert that emoji are language that's,991889.0,993689.0
1,fine you just have to do that in emoji,993690.0,995169.0
1,L: oh snap,995170.0,995919.0
1,G: yeah and you have to like,995920.0,998159.0
1,make someone who doesn't know that's,998160.0,999989.0
1,what you're intending be able to read,999990.0,1001909.0
1,that sentence because any language that,1001910.0,1004159.0
1,"we have, you know, even Esperanto, I don't",1004160.0,1006049.0
1,know maybe in these Blissymbolics can,1006050.0,1007609.0
1,assert that it's a language like there's,1007610.0,1009198.0
1,a way to say in Esperanto 'Esperanto is a language',1009199.0,1011179.0
1,L: yeah,1011180.0,1011679.0
1,G: and so I got all these,1011680.0,1013338.0
1,responses and you read them and I was,1013339.0,1016039.0
1,you know having a lot of fun providing,1016040.0,1017688.0
1,naive interpretations of them something,1017689.0,1019578.0
1,"like 'I get happy when I sing the alphabet song', you know?'",1019579.0,1022359.0
1,L: so not that successful,1022360.0,1023958.0
1,so far,1023959.0,1025039.0
1,"G: not that successful so far, and I don't",1025040.0,1026839.0
1,think it's for lack of creativity I,1026840.0,1028279.0
1,think it's because that's not what emoji,1028280.0,1030559.0
1,are designed to communicate that's not what,1030560.0,1032629.0
1,obvious pictures are designed to,1032630.0,1033619.0
1,communicate there's a limit to how much,1033620.0,1035449.0
1,meaning can be obvious because we have,1035450.0,1038119.0
1,all these abstract things that we mean,1038120.0,1041299.0
1,and lots of stuff that we talk about is not picture-able,1041300.0,1044619.0
1,L: I get this a lot as well,1044620.0,1046459.0
1,when I talk to people about gesture and,1046460.0,1049309.0
1,people are like 'ah gestures are like the,1049310.0,1051679.0
1,great universal thing that humans have',1051680.0,1054289.0
1,'you know when I travel I don't learn to,1054290.0,1056569.0

1,if all you want to do is point at things,1064100.0,1065479.0
1,and be a bit obnoxious but actually,1065480.0,1067699.0
1,beyond the fact that as far as we can,1067700.0,1069559.0
1,tell every society seems to have,1069560.0,1072529.0
1,gestures a lot of what we presume is,1072530.0,1074989.0
1,universal about gesture is partly based,1074990.0,1077419.0
1,on this iconicity so that's something,1077420.0,1079219.0
1,that ties it to emoji and Blissymbols,1079220.0,1081619.0
1,"in a way, because there's some",1081620.0,1082759.0
1,relationship between the gesture or the,1082760.0,1085249.0
1,emoji and the thing it's representing or,1085250.0,1088009.0
1,referring to,1088010.0,1088999.0
1,G: yes so if you like if you put your hand,1089000.0,1090949.0
1,up to your mouth that conveys eating or,1090950.0,1093289.0
1,drinking or something because when you,1093290.0,1094699.0
1,"eat you put things in your mouth, so of",1094700.0,1096259.0
1,course that's what it means,1096260.0,1097489.0
1,L: in the way a smiley emoji resembles the way your,1097490.0,1100459.0
1,lips curl up when you're happy,1100460.0,1101959.0
1,this kind of visuality of it makes,1101960.0,1104239.0
1,people think well I can understand it so,1104240.0,1106189.0
1,it must be universal but more and more,1106190.0,1108469.0
1,we look at the way different cultures,1108470.0,1110059.0
1,gesture - even something as simple as,1110060.0,1111649.0
1,pointing. We for a long time for that,1111650.0,1113539.0
1,index finger pointing was the the,1113540.0,1115609.0
1,default universal way to point. And in fact,1115610.0,1117559.0
1,we now know cultures point with their,1117560.0,1118789.0
1,"lip. Um, we know that some people in",1118790.0,1122209.0
1,some cultures because of various,1122210.0,1123919.0
1,taboos or because of style preferences,1123920.0,1125539.0
1,will point with their eyes or their,1125540.0,1127129.0
1,eyebrows and there's a whole collection,1127130.0,1128869.0
1,of different handshapes you can use to,1128870.0,1130909.0
1,point in indigenous communities in,1130910.0,1132889.0
1,Central Australia so people will point,1132890.0,1135949.0
1,with an open hand which means a,1135950.0,1137959.0
1,"collection, I'm pointing at a collection of",1137960.0,1139639.0
1,things and also there's taboos in,1139640.0,1141559.0
1,"some communities on pointing, or pointing",1141560.0,1143719.0
1,"with the index finger, or pointing with the",1143720.0,1145429.0
1,left hand instead of the right hand,1145430.0,1147229.0
1,G: and you know even even in English point with,1147230.0,1149149.0
1,your middle finger can sometimes,1149150.0,1151309.0
1,L: in Nepal where I spend a lot of time,1151310.0,1153649.0
1,that is a lot of free variation between,1153650.0,1155179.0
1,index finger and middle finger pointing,1155180.0,1157669.0
1,um,1157670.0,1158779.0
1,and my Westerner sensibilities still,1158780.0,1161119.0
1,giggle at that,1161120.0,1161959.0
1,G: yeah I had a had a piano teacher once,1161960.0,1163699.0
1,who just at point with everything with his,1163700.0,1164839.0
1,middle finger and I was thinking I know,1164840.0,1166489.0
1,you're just pointing to the stuff but it's,1166490.0,1167869.0
1,really distracted right now,1167870.0,1169759.0
1,L: so people are like 'we could all just gesture to each other',1169760.0,1171469.0
1,or all and sign language,1171470.0,1174169.0
1,and like sign language is still have all the same,1174170.0,1175639.0
1,grammatical requirements of spoken languages,1175640.0,1177829.0
1,G: yeah,1177830.0,1178759.0
1,with an occasional bit of iconic,1178760.0,1180739.0
1,convenience for you to learn signs but,1180740.0,1183529.0
1,ah it's not going to bring about world peace,1183530.0,1187429.0
1,"G: yeah, I mean that there's some iconic",1187430.0,1189499.0
1,stuff about spoken languages as well,1189500.0,1191119.0
1,there was an interesting recent study,1191120.0,1193339.0
1,trying to look at statistically what are,1193340.0,1195469.0
1,some iconic things that show up and,1195470.0,1197539.0
1,spoken languages like the word for 'nose',1197540.0,1201199.0
1,tends to happen an 'n' it because the 'n',1201200.0,1204769.0
1,sound is a nasal sound is produced by,1204770.0,1206599.0
1,putting air out of your nose and so in,1206600.0,1208639.0
1,something like two-thirds of the world's,1208640.0,1210049.0
1,languages the word for nose has an 'n',1210050.0,1212449.0
1,in it which is you know statistically,1212450.0,1214609.0
1,improbable I guess that's what they,1214610.0,1216049.0
1,found but two-thirds is a high number,1216050.0,1218179.0
1,for statistics but it's not a universal,1218180.0,1220489.0
1,L: good as been getting,1220490.0,1222889.0
1,G: like it's not every language it's just a lot of them,1222890.0,1224869.0
1,you know it's cool that sometimes you get this.,1224870.0,1226759.0
1,It's part of the way there but it's not,1226760.0,1228589.0
1,going to automatically give you an,1228590.0,1230359.0
1,"entire vocabulary in another language,",1230360.0,1231739.0
1,because there's a lot of stuff that's,1231740.0,1233299.0
1,not obviously iconic,1233300.0,1235159.0
1,"L: grammar, we're back to grammar.",1235160.0,1238249.0
1,G: This is why languages are great because they have all this grammar and they're,1238250.0,1239629.0
1,not completely obvious,1239630.0,1240619.0
1,L: so a lot of people now are like 'well you know we're basically,1240620.0,1243589.0
1,there with English so let's just make,1243590.0,1245059.0
1,English the universal language',1245060.0,1247189.0
1,one industry where that is actually kind of,1247190.0,1249169.0
1,happening is aviation so you have,1249170.0,1251089.0
1,something now called 'Aviation English',1251090.0,1252979.0
1,which is an attempt to make sure that,1252980.0,1254929.0
1,people who work in the International,1254930.0,1256849.0
1,Civil Aviation Organization all speak a,1256850.0,1259909.0
1,degree of a particular kind of English,1259910.0,1262009.0
1,that has very set terminology and very,1262010.0,1264979.0
1,"set word order and features like that, so",1264980.0,1267529.0
1,that there aren't any miscommunications.,1267530.0,1269329.0
1,In 1977 at tenerife airport two boeing 747s,1269330.0,1274099.0
1,"collided, and it was basically because",1274100.0,1276289.0
1,one took off too early because the,1276290.0,1278599.0
1,person in the control tower and the,1278600.0,1280699.0
1,pilot weren't really communicating,1280700.0,1282349.0
1,clearly. The pilot said something,1282350.0,1284569.0
1,non-standard that they were taking off,1284570.0,1287149.0
1,and the person in the control tower,1287150.0,1288499.0
1,assumed that they were going through the,1288500.0,1289939.0
1,standard motions and,1289940.0,1291239.0
1,requesting permission to take off and,1291240.0,1293789.0
1,instead of giving the correct reply just,1293790.0,1296729.0
1,said 'ok' which the pilot took as 'okay you,1296730.0,1299849.0
1,can take off now because that's what you,1299850.0,1301678.0
1,just said you would do' and so that plane,1301679.0,1303899.0
1,collided with another plane midair and,1303900.0,1306449.0
1,many people died and so now there is,1306450.0,1308369.0
1,very precise standardized phraseology,1308370.0,1310499.0
1,and there's also a radio telephony it's,1310500.0,1313529.0
1,the International Phonetic Alphabet,1313530.0,1315359.0
1,that's not the linguistic phonetic,1315360.0,1317428.0
1,alphabet the 'Alpha Bravo Charlie',1317429.0,1320129.0
1,G: I mean it's useful because 'b' and 'c' and 'd' and 'e',1320130.0,1324058.0
1,and stuff they sound very similarly they all,1324059.0,1325829.0
1,have an /e/ sound and so if you're not,1325830.0,1327479.0
1,quite sure what consonant came with,1327480.0,1329159.0
1,them especially over a terrible radio,1329160.0,1332308.0
1,signal that's really fuzzy it's easy to misinterpret.,1332309.0,1334619.0
1,L: it's also the one that,1334620.0,1336779.0
1,ensures that you have to say 'niner',1336780.0,1338549.0
1,instead of 'nine',1338550.0,1339989.0
1,"G: yeah and you see it sometimes, I mean,",1339990.0,1341729.0
1,I've encountered if you're like on the,1341730.0,1343199.0
1,phone with your bank or something,1343200.0,1346019.0
1,and you're spelling,1346020.0,1349199.0
1,something for them and people sometimes,1349200.0,1351539.0
1,use kind of an ad-hoc system like you,1351540.0,1353009.0
1,don't have necessarily have memorized,1353010.0,1354299.0
1,the international aviation one but you,1354300.0,1356789.0
1,just pick a common names so you say like 'n' as,1356790.0,1358919.0
1,in 'Nancy' or 'm' as in 'Michael' because N and M,1358920.0,1361619.0
1,sound very similar over the phone so,1361620.0,1363899.0
1,there's various ways to kind of get by,1363900.0,1365819.0
1,these degraded communications. Another,1365820.0,1368339.0
1,one that I find is very cool which is,1368340.0,1370229.0
1,about like let's just do everything in,1370230.0,1371909.0
1,English but it still got this,1371910.0,1373409.0
1,high-stakes aspect is on the ISS on the,1373410.0,1377549.0
1,"International Space Station, where",1377550.0,1379558.0
1,you have astronauts from the US and from,1379559.0,1382139.0
1,other English speaking countries,1382140.0,1383669.0
1,you have cosmonauts from Russia and,1383670.0,1385649.0
1,obviously it's very important to,1385650.0,1387239.0
1,get your communication right if you're,1387240.0,1389939.0
1,on a tiny metal box circling the Earth,1389940.0,1393359.0
1,or going somewhere you know you don't,1393360.0,1395909.0
1,want to like have a miscommunication,1395910.0,1396989.0
1,there because you could end up floating,1396990.0,1398879.0
1,in space in the wrong way and so one of,1398880.0,1401999.0
1,the things that they do on the ISS so,1402000.0,1403289.0
1,first of all every astronaut and,1403290.0,1405629.0
1,cosmonaut needs to be bilingual in,1405630.0,1408299.0
1,English and Russian because those are,1408300.0,1409859.0
1,the languages of space,1409860.0,1410969.0
1,L: yep. The language of space are,1410970.0,1412678.0
1,English and Russian? I'm sorry I just said,1412679.0,1414089.0
1,'yep' and then I didn't really think about,1414090.0,1415319.0
1,the fact that that's a fact is it?,1415320.0,1417869.0
1,"G: I mean pretty much, yeah, if you go on",1417870.0,1419909.0

1,forums which I have,1423030.0,1424799.0
1,gone on for research for this episode...,1424800.0,1427049.0

1,G: I don't think I'm going,1428790.0,1431489.0
1,to become an astronaut but I would like,1431490.0,1432779.0
1,to do astronaut linguistics. And so,1432780.0,1435269.0
1,"one of the things they say, you know you need to",1435270.0,1436679.0
1,know like stuff about math and engineering,1436680.0,1438149.0
1,"and, like, aerodynamics and like you",1438150.0,1440789.0
1,also fly planes in you know the military,1440790.0,1443849.0
1,and stuff like this are various,1443850.0,1445709.0
1,"things people need to know. And they also,",1445710.0,1447149.0
1,"you know, you either have to arrive",1447150.0,1449099.0
1,knowing English and Russian or they put you,1449100.0,1451799.0
1,through an intensive language,1451800.0,1452789.0
1,training course (L: ok),1452790.0,1453899.0
1,when they're up in the air one of the,1453900.0,1456299.0
1,things that they try to do is have the,1456300.0,1459659.0
1,English native speakers speak Russian,1459660.0,1462119.0
1,and a Russian speakers speak English (L: right),1462120.0,1463739.0
1,because the idea is if you speak,1463740.0,1466679.0
1,your non-native language then you're,1466680.0,1469349.0
1,sure what you're saying and the,1469350.0,1471779.0
1,other person can understand you better.,1471780.0,1473939.0
1,Whereas if you speak your native,1473940.0,1474959.0
1,language maybe you're speaking too fast,1474960.0,1476459.0
1,or maybe you're not sure if the,1476460.0,1478619.0
1,"other person's really understanding you,",1478620.0,1480149.0
1,to get a better kind of comprehension,1480150.0,1481979.0
1,check. If you both speak the language,1481980.0,1484289.0
1,you're not as fluent in then you arrive,1484290.0,1486989.0
1,at a level where where people can be,1486990.0,1488429.0
1,sure that the other person's,1488430.0,1489269.0
1,understanding and there's kind of,1489270.0,1490649.0
1,this hybrid English Russian,1490650.0,1492179.0
1,language I think that's developed not a,1492180.0,1494189.0

1,the most about the one language bringing,1546330.0,1548729.0
1,peace and happiness fallacy is that like,1548730.0,1551129.0
1,we just know it's wrong,1551130.0,1552869.0
1,from the evidence. People who speak,1552870.0,1554759.0
1,the same language don't inherently get along,1554760.0,1557019.0

1,have ever been in a family?,1567520.0,1568899.0
1,Have they never had arguments?,1568900.0,1570939.0
1,L: you have people who,1570940.0,1571959.0
1,have grown up in exactly the same,1571960.0,1573159.0
1,linguistic environment.,1573160.0,1574779.0
1,G: yeah like people get married and then,1574780.0,1576669.0
1,they get divorced it's not because they,1576670.0,1578199.0
1,don't speak the same language it's because,1578200.0,1579699.0
1,they have irreconcilable differences,1579700.0,1582009.0
1,L: they probably think the same language too well,1582010.0,1583539.0
1,so they can say all the horrible,1583540.0,1585099.0
1,things to each other.,1585100.0,1586299.0
1,G: yeah like you fight with your siblings,1586300.0,1587889.0
1,or something like it's not because you,1587890.0,1589779.0
1,don't speak the same language just don't get along.,1589780.0,1591909.0
1,L: so Australia English as far as,1591910.0,1594609.0
1,"like, you know - you look at America and there's",1594610.0,1596439.0
1,quite a lot of linguistic diversity for one,1596440.0,1598989.0
1,country. Australia is very,1598990.0,1600279.0
1,linguistically homogeneous but when,1600280.0,1602439.0
1,there's a state-based or,1602440.0,1603999.0
1,city-based linguistic variation in,1604000.0,1606459.0
1,Australian English we just lose our,1606460.0,1608349.0
1,collective shit over it. It's kind of,1608350.0,1610449.0
1,impressive how homogeneous Australian,1610450.0,1613209.0
1,English is and how disproportionately,1613210.0,1615699.0
1,outraged people get about variation. One war,1615700.0,1619329.0
1,that kind of flames up every few years,1619330.0,1621249.0
1,is something known as the 'potato cake,1621250.0,1623739.0
1,potatoes scallop' was. If you go to a,1623740.0,1625629.0
1,fish-and-chip shop in Australia a,1625630.0,1627129.0
1,particular menu item that's available is,1627130.0,1629739.0
1,a like large disk of potato that's deep,1629740.0,1632439.0
1,fried and it's very tasty and it's,1632440.0,1634989.0
1,great like everyone should want to eat,1634990.0,1637419.0
1,them but for some reason in Victoria and,1637420.0,1639579.0
1,South Australia they're known as potato,1639580.0,1641199.0
1,cakes in New South Wales and Queensland,1641200.0,1644019.0
1,they're known as scallops or potato,1644020.0,1646809.0
1,scallops and this just upsets people so much,1646810.0,1649899.0
1,G: I'm kind of baffled by this,1649900.0,1652029.0
1,because I'm Canadian and I have,1652030.0,1654549.0
1,both the item potato cake and potato,1654550.0,1656559.0
1,scallop they just refer to different things,1656560.0,1657729.0
1,L: so what do they mean in Canadian English?,1657730.0,1659739.0
1,G: so neither of them is your thing,1659740.0,1661959.0
1,L: so both of them are the wrong thing.,1661960.0,1663789.0
1,G: both of them are the the right thing. Anyway we're not going,1663790.0,1665379.0
1,to have this argument. So potatoes,1665380.0,1667269.0
1,scallop is like a casserole (L: ok) you,1667270.0,1669729.0
1,slice the potatoes and then you make,1669730.0,1671499.0
1,like a cream sauce and then you bake it in the oven,1671500.0,1673269.0
1,"L: ah, see that's scalloped potatoes",1673270.0,1675159.0
1,"G: oh, see scallop potatoes and",1675160.0,1677559.0
1,potato scallop are the same thing for me,1677560.0,1679119.0
1,L: right ok.,1679120.0,1679719.0
1,then a potato cake is kind of more like,1679720.0,1681999.0
1,your thing but it's not necessarily,1682000.0,1683259.0
1,deep-fried and sometimes there's fish,1683260.0,1685509.0
1,involved i guess this fish cakes.,1685510.0,1687369.0
1,L: oh well that's terrible then,1687370.0,1688329.0
1,G: no but you like,1688330.0,1689469.0
1,you just beat the potato but you don't necessarily,1689470.0,1690758.0
1,deep-fried it you could just pan-fry it,1690759.0,1691658.0
1,L: okay,1691659.0,1692258.0
1,G: i think people project,1692259.0,1694298.0
1,their differences and their opinions,1694299.0,1699338.0
1,about other people on the languages,1699339.0,1700778.0
1,it's not as though the language comes with these,1700779.0,1702819.0
1,particular distinctions itself it's a,1702820.0,1704828.0
1,proxy for things you think about,1704829.0,1706898.0
1,particular good people or the,1706899.0,1708848.0
1,simmering ethnic divides in Australia,1708849.0,1711069.0
1,between people who live in Victoria people who don't,1711070.0,1712418.0
1,L: or just the simmering,1712419.0,1713768.0
1,"geographic divides. There's nothing ethnic,",1713769.0,1715569.0
1,"there's nothing particularly linguistic, it's",1715570.0,1717428.0
1,purely that the Victorians and the,1717429.0,1720128.0
1,New South Welsh will find any reason to,1720129.0,1722138.0
1,disagree and we don't always have that,1722139.0,1723818.0
1,many so we were reduced to like,1723819.0,1725588.0
1,bickering over fried food.,1725589.0,1727988.0
1,G: at a larger scale,1727989.0,1728828.0
1,I think people see things like these,1728829.0,1730268.0
1,trade languages or aviation English,1730269.0,1732578.0
1,things like that or like international,1732579.0,1734018.0
1,symbols for like the Olympics where you,1734019.0,1736118.0
1,can see the symbol and see okay which,1736119.0,1738398.0
1,sporting event does this refer to.,1738399.0,1740558.0
1,"You think 'Wow! OK, people can kind of",1740559.0,1741728.0
1,understand each other maybe if we had,1741729.0,1743378.0
1,more of this we could do more of this,1743379.0,1744818.0
1,trade.' But there's still a big divide,1744819.0,1747548.0
1,"when it comes to nationalistically, you",1747549.0,1749918.0
1,know there are civil wars they have,1749919.0,1751928.0
1,there been many of them in history and,1751929.0,1754028.0
1,they aren't because people don't speak the same,1754029.0,1755498.0
1,language in the same country they're,1755499.0,1757388.0
1,because they do think the same language,1757389.0,1758798.0
1,and they realize that they hate each,1758799.0,1760028.0
1,"other. Or, imposing a language on",1760029.0,1762458.0
1,"people just so that you can all speak the same language,",1762459.0,1764228.0
1,"you know, this leads to resentment.",1764229.0,1765458.0
1,L: English as a lingua franca days we have,1765459.0,1768488.0
1,to remember is because of fairly,1768489.0,1771158.0
1,gratuitous and heinous colonial,1771159.0,1773318.0
1,expansion by the British.,1773319.0,1775868.0
1,"G: yeah, Latin as a common language was also due",1775869.0,1777998.0
1,to Latin/Roman imperial expansion.,1777999.0,1780428.0
1,And sometimes you get a common language,1780429.0,1782678.0
1,but it's not because people just wake up,1782679.0,1784238.0
1,one day and they like to decide that,1784239.0,1785738.0
1,they want to speak this language is,1785739.0,1787118.0
1,because they were forced to many cases.,1787119.0,1789218.0
1,L: I talked about Australia being a place,1789219.0,1791439.0
1,where people can get really riled up,1791440.0,1793448.0
1,about the different and potato cake and a,1793449.0,1795728.0
1,potato scallop and you can think of,1795729.0,1797198.0
1,Australia as being really culturally,1797199.0,1798968.0
1,"homogeneous because of that. Like, if that",1798969.0,1800798.0
1,the level of difference that we're,1800799.0,1802388.0
1,trying to pick a fight about.,1802389.0,1804218.0
1,"But actually, Australia is amazingly",1804219.0,1806408.0
1,linguistically diverse and amazingly,1806409.0,1808208.0
1,full of cultural diversity and I think,1808209.0,1810968.0
1,sometimes people can get so caught up in,1810969.0,1812768.0
1,thinking that one language will solve,1812769.0,1815439.0
1,all of these problems that we run the,1815440.0,1817508.0
1,risk of attempting to homogenize or,1817509.0,1819818.0
1,losing really wonderful diversity.,1819819.0,1821978.0
1,G: yeah i think just as language can be at,1821979.0,1824149.0
1,"thing that we project, you know, our",1824150.0,1825949.0
1,feelings about particular people on it,1825950.0,1827509.0
1,also think that we protect kind of our,1827510.0,1828919.0
1,hopes for humanity on - every Miss America,1828920.0,1832159.0
1,contestant does want world peace but we,1832160.0,1834019.0
1,do want peace we do want people to be,1834020.0,1836149.0
1,able to get along least in theory. It's,1836150.0,1838219.0
1,just that I think of pluralistic way of,1838220.0,1841579.0
1,'wouldn't be great everyone spoke,1841580.0,1843439.0

2,G: welcome to Lingthusiasm a podcast that's,4880.0,7669.0
2,enthusiastic about linguistics I'm,7670.0,10099.0
2,Gretchen McCulloch L: and I'm Lauren Gawne,10100.0,11899.0
2,today we're going to be talking about,11900.0,13429.0
2,pronouns and how these little words do a lot,13430.0,15979.0
2,of work. But first let's talk about where,15980.0,16479.0
2,our logo comes from.,16480.0,20059.0
2,G: so when we were coming up with the idea,20060.0,22249.0
2,that maybe we wanted to start a podcast and,22250.0,23988.0
2,we started talking about logos - because that's,23989.0,25668.0
2,"the first thing, obviously! We realized",25669.0,27949.0
2,"that Superlinguo, Lauren's blog, uses a",27950.0,30258.0
2,"yellow-green background and my blog,",30259.0,32359.0
2,"All Things Linguistic, uses a teal background,",32360.0,34279.0
2,"kind of a bluish-green, so we figured",34280.0,36349.0
2,"that a true green, a vivid green, was the",36350.0,39319.0
2,logical way of splitting the difference,39320.0,40399.0
2,between that. L: We're both big green fans,40400.0,43429.0
2,and we also have IPA symbols in both of,43430.0,46879.0
2,our logos. Superlinguo has a schwa and,46880.0,49699.0
2,All Things Linguistic has three,49700.0,51979.0
2,"and... I can't even remember, how that is that?",51980.0,54589.0
2,There's a theta I know that G: it's alpha,54590.0,56959.0
2,"theta lambda, it's an acronym",56960.0,58759.0
2,L: Ah yeah that makes sense G: yeah but they're also,58760.0,60979.0
2,symbols that are used in linguistics L: so,60980.0,63169.0
2,kind of nerdy linguistic symbol logos,63170.0,66649.0
2,meant that we're going to continue,66650.0,69108.0
2,that theme with this one as well. G: and so,69109.0,71959.0
2,we ended up going with the one that we,71960.0,73428.0
2,have which is a triple purpose logo. If you,73429.0,76218.0
2,"haven't seen it, it's presumably in the",76219.0,78019.0
2,icon of whatever program you're using to,78020.0,79548.0
2,listen to this podcast. We decided the,79549.0,81559.0
2,symbol that is there looks like the,81560.0,83688.0
2,international phonetic alphabet symbol,83689.0,85489.0
2,for the glottal stop - just the sound in,85490.0,87919.0
2,"'oh oh', this kind of stop of air in the back",87920.0,90468.0
2,of your throat. But we got it by cutting,90469.0,92688.0
2,off the dot at the bottom of a,92689.0,94398.0
2,question mark because that gave us more,94399.0,95958.0
2,font options.,95959.0,96888.0
2,"L: unfortunately, disappointingly few",96889.0,100099.0
2,stylish fonts have full IPA range for,100100.0,103129.0
2,the international phonetic alphabet.,103130.0,104898.0
2,"G: we were very disappointed, but this was",104899.0,106669.0
2,actually one of the reasons why we,106670.0,108138.0
2,picked the global stopped - because that,108139.0,109548.0
2,way we could just chopped off some,109549.0,111288.0
2,question marks and we have a lot more,111289.0,112908.0
2,stuff to choose from. L: and then we kinda,112909.0,114678.0
2,like that the end result of the one that,114679.0,116809.0
2,we chose looks a little bit like a,116810.0,118099.0
2,"little ear. G: yeah! yeah, so it looks a",118100.0,120468.0
2,"little bit like an ear, it looks a little",120469.0,121548.0
2,bit like a question mark itself because we are,121549.0,123169.0
2,"curious about things, and it is also",123170.0,126739.0
2,an IPA symbol. L: because we are quite,126740.0,129589.0
2,lingthusiastic about things. G: we are very,129590.0,131659.0
2,lingthusiasic!,131660.0,132649.0
2,Yay! Ah and the name I guess will probably,132650.0,134599.0
2,be pretty obvious.,134600.0,144719.0
2,L: today we are going to talk about,144720.0,159699.0
2,"pronouns, which some of you might",159700.0,163179.0
2,have a kind of trauma of - it sounds like,163180.0,166628.0
2,a dirty word from grammar classes in,166629.0,169749.0
2,"high school, or some of you may be going",169750.0,172179.0
2,into sweats from recollections of,172180.0,174279.0
2,learning second languages - but we think,174280.0,177009.0
2,pronouns are pretty rad and so today we're,177010.0,178988.0
2,"going to be talking about those. G: yeah,",178989.0,180518.0
2,"pronouns are fun. So pronouns, if you",180519.0,183759.0
2,"forget what they are, are these little",183760.0,186279.0
2,words that stand in place of a noun,186280.0,189189.0
2,"so you have things like I, me, you",189190.0,191499.0
2,"your, our, we, she/he, it, they - all of the",191500.0,196779.0
2,little pronouns that do stuff like that.,196780.0,199029.0
2,Instead of just continually repeating,199030.0,200348.0
2,the noun you can use a pronoun instead. So,200349.0,203378.0
2,hypothetically they're a way of making,203379.0,206409.0
2,"language more efficient, because you",206410.0,207789.0
2,don't have to just keep saying the noun over,207790.0,209529.0
2,and over again. You've all had this,209530.0,210909.0
2,conversation with people who just keep,210910.0,212138.0
2,repeating your name and you're like no,212139.0,213668.0
2,"just, just stop. L: it's the creepy way AI robots in sci-fi will always",213669.0,220029.0
2,continue to refer to you by your,220030.0,222668.0
2,full name and its really creepy.,222669.0,224229.0
2,'what are you doing Hal? Hal don't do that',224230.0,226899.0
2,always includes that full noun reference,226900.0,229629.0

2,I always think of it as like a pointing,252549.0,254259.0
2,thing so it means that they don't always,254260.0,257078.0
2,point at exactly the same thing all the,257079.0,259059.0
2,time - where they point depends on the,259060.0,261098.0
2,context in which they're employed. It,261099.0,262869.0
2,sounds painfully obvious until you're trying,262870.0,264489.0
2,to pull it apart in a language you don't,264490.0,266049.0
2,"speak that well, but when I say 'I', I for",266050.0,269769.0

2,it's a very important insight when it comes to pronouns.,307340.0,309259.0
2,L: and that's why robots in AI in sci-fi sound,309260.0,313309.0

2,"the pronoun space differently, you know. I",323690.0,325969.0

2,"to be a singular second person pronoun,",341300.0,343549.0
2,and you know now we have innovative,343550.0,345709.0
2,forms like 'you all' and 'you guys' and,345710.0,348739.0
2,'y'all' and a whole bunch of others. L: 'youse'.,348740.0,351589.0
2,"'youse' is the Australian one. G: ah good, so we have",351590.0,355129.0
2,all of these different ways of carving,355130.0,356629.0
2,up the the pronoun space. And then in the,356630.0,358789.0
2,third person pronouns we have a whole,358790.0,360739.0
2,bunch of different ways - L: and even within,360740.0,362839.0
2,"the first and second person, so the first",362840.0,365209.0
2,being 'me' and second being 'you' - even,365210.0,367129.0

2,"ways to carve up the space, and lots",368570.0,371029.0
2,of different languages do different,371030.0,372379.0
2,things that are really neat. One thing I,372380.0,374569.0
2,"like about Yolmo, which is a Tibetan",374570.0,377779.0
2,"language that I work with, is that they have",377780.0,379939.0
2,"inclusive and exclusive versions of 'us',",379940.0,382339.0
2,and the inclusion and exclusion is,382340.0,384499.0
2,referring to the person that you're,384500.0,385939.0
2,speaking to - So you can use one form and it,385940.0,388729.0
2,means 'we including you who I'm talking,388730.0,391639.0
2,to you right now are all going to go to,391640.0,394069.0
2,the cinema' and then there's a 'we are all,394070.0,396199.0

2,including you who I'm talking to right,397820.0,399979.0

2,I think is a socially very handy thing,402470.0,404629.0
2,to have.,404630.0,405918.0
2,G: yeah it means the difference between,405919.0,406849.0
2,"'we're going to the movies, are you ready",406850.0,409129.0
2,yet?',409130.0,409659.0

2,incredibly incapable of reading social,413380.0,415659.0
2,"interactions very well, I think this kind",415660.0,418149.0
2,of thing in English would be so handy to,418150.0,420339.0
2,know if you're included in the trip to,420340.0,422769.0
2,"drinks after work, or if you're included",422770.0,425199.0
2,"in the meeting or something like that. G: yeah,",425200.0,427209.0
2,it's a it's a really useful distinction,427210.0,428799.0
2,"this inclusive and exclusive we, and",428800.0,431589.0
2,English doesn't have it.,431590.0,432489.0
2,That's one of things iI wish English had,432490.0,434469.0
2,"L: yeah G: yeah, that's a fun one. And English is",434470.0,436989.0
2,kind of gradually working on trying to,436990.0,438939.0
2,figure out a plural 'you' form. We've got a bunch,438940.0,441639.0
2,of different dialects but not a standard,441640.0,443439.0
2,"one for writing, and that's a massive",443440.0,445809.0
2,lack because you want to be able to,445810.0,447309.0
2,distinguish between 'are you,447310.0,449499.0
2,"coming?' and 'are all of you coming?' because,",449500.0,451659.0
2,"again, you know who's invited. And",451660.0,453579.0
2,then another distinction that gets made,453580.0,455319.0
2,"with second person pronouns, is you can make a",455320.0,457299.0
2,lot of politeness distinctions in second,457300.0,459099.0
2,person. Sso you can say 'you',459100.0,461199.0
2,"informal, 'you' formal. So I speak French,",461200.0,464259.0
2,and French makes a distinction between,464260.0,466449.0
2,'tu' and 'vous' - where 'tu' is informal,466450.0,469989.0
2,"and also singular, and 'vous' can be either",469990.0,471579.0
2,singular or plural. Wwhen its singular,471580.0,473109.0
2,it's formal. I find actually the weird,473110.0,475179.0
2,"thing about this is I get annoyed,",475180.0,477669.0
2,because I don't have an equivalent of,477670.0,479229.0
2,"'you all', like I don't have a way of being",479230.0,481419.0
2,"unambiguously plural, because sometimes you know if I go to a store and I want to",481420.0,485259.0
2,say 'do you guys have any bananas?' or,485260.0,487899.0
2,something and I don't want to imply... L: as,487900.0,490149.0
2,opposed to 'you specific cashier do you,490150.0,492399.0
2,"have any bananas with you right now?' G: yeah I,",492400.0,494139.0
2,"I don't want to put them on the spot, like,",494140.0,495339.0
2,"it's not your fault if you're out of bananas, that's the store managers",495340.0,498519.0
2,fault or something. So it's weird to,498520.0,501999.0
2,me that I don't have an unambiguously,502000.0,503409.0
2,"plural pronoun, but I do instead have to",503410.0,506079.0
2,navigate this politeness distinction -,506080.0,507549.0
2,where particularly,507550.0,510339.0
2,you're dealing with kind of,510340.0,511239.0
2,strangers you meet in public and so you,511240.0,513489.0
2,don't have any frame of reference to,513490.0,514959.0
2,know anything about them already - do you,514960.0,516309.0
2,use the the 'tu' or the 'vous' ? it kind of,516310.0,519189.0
2,"depends on their age, and whether it",519190.0,521739.0
2,seems like you're peers or they're,521740.0,524139.0
2,like an older person you want to respect,524140.0,525969.0
2,them or something like that. L: as an,525970.0,528219.0
2,"English native speaker, growing up",528220.0,530169.0
2,with the language that doesn't have any,530170.0,531429.0
2,"kind of politeness distinction like that,",531430.0,533619.0
2,and growing up in Australia which is,533620.0,535179.0
2,kind of stereotypically famous for its,535180.0,537519.0
2,lack of formal register - even,537520.0,540759.0
2,though that's not entirely true -,540760.0,542869.0
2,but this distinction in formality really,542870.0,544819.0
2,made me - and you hear this a lot from,544820.0,546619.0
2,English speakers when they learn,546620.0,547789.0
2,languages with these pronoun difference,547790.0,550459.0
2,distinctions - it really stresses them out,550460.0,552499.0
2,as to which one is appropriate. I,552500.0,554719.0
2,"started learning nepali which has, not",554720.0,557119.0
2,"only two, it had three different",557120.0,558169.0
2,politeness distinctions. So it has,558170.0,561469.0
2,the formal polite pronoun and then it,561470.0,564169.0
2,has the like one that you can use with,564170.0,566119.0
2,"people who you're close to,",566120.0,568219.0
2,and then it has one that is,568220.0,569989.0
2,for children and dogs. So my,569990.0,573409.0
2,nepali teacher just didn't even teach me,573410.0,574999.0
2,that one - she was like 'as a foreigner there,575000.0,576588.0
2,is no social situation in which that one,576589.0,578599.0
2,is going to be appropriately useful for,578600.0,580609.0
2,you' and so trying to navigate when which,580610.0,583519.0
2,one is appropriate,583520.0,584838.0
2,"it can be, it can feel a bit stressful.",584839.0,586519.0
2,G: I get it because - so I learned,586520.0,589549.0
2,France french but now I live in Quebec -,589550.0,591739.0
2,but in France French they use 'vous' a lot,591740.0,593599.0
2,more than in Quebec French. So in Quebec,593600.0,595639.0
2,French to a stranger in public you're a,595640.0,597409.0
2,lot more likely to say 'tu' whereas in,597410.0,598969.0
2,France French you're more likely to say 'vous' L: hmmm,598970.0,601189.0
2,G: so I know I'm too formal for some people,601190.0,603439.0
2,and like they'll 'vous' me back L: yep G: but they,603440.0,605599.0
2,don't really think they should be,605600.0,607099.0
2,"needing to. L: right yeah, and because there's",607100.0,610009.0
2,"this thing, like maybe being polite is just the best default thing to do but",610010.0,614269.0
2,then in some social situations it,614270.0,616069.0
2,actually pushes people away and makes it difficult.,616070.0,618499.0
2,"G: yeah, and being polite can kinda create this",618500.0,620059.0
2,"social distance. L: yep G: you know, there's some",620060.0,622069.0
2,languages we're using words like 'please',622070.0,624739.0
2,and 'thank you' or polite,624740.0,626299.0
2,forms to ask someone to pass you the,626300.0,628579.0
2,"beans or whatever, it is actually ruder if",628580.0,630739.0
2,"you say it to a family member, because",630740.0,631909.0
2,you shouldn't have to be polite to a,631910.0,632989.0
2,family member. And that's a sign of,632990.0,634519.0
2,"social distance between you, so yeah",634520.0,636109.0
2,politeness pronouns are very complicated,636110.0,638539.0
2,thing. L: and they're complicated for native,638540.0,640909.0
2,speakers. So there's an article in the,640910.0,642919.0
2,latest edition of 'Language' which is a,642920.0,645739.0
2,scholarly journal and it looks at,645740.0,648889.0
2,pronouns in Spanish. so Spanish has a very,648890.0,651439.0
2,"similar distinction to that in French, where it",651440.0,653899.0
2,has a formal and informal register. And so,653900.0,656539.0
2,this work was done by Chase Wesley,656540.0,658729.0
2,Raymond who's at the University of,658730.0,660469.0
2,Colorado and this was a massive,660470.0,662929.0
2,"corpus study, so there are over a",662930.0,664819.0
2,thousand speakers in the corpus and,664820.0,666979.0
2,hundreds of hours of recorded,666980.0,669049.0
2,conversations between different people,669050.0,670909.0
2,"in different contexts, and this study",670910.0,673489.0
2,demonstrating... you know people who speak,673490.0,675439.0
2,these languages,675440.0,675919.0
2,"probably have these feelings anyway, but",675920.0,677809.0
2,this study demonstrated that when people,677810.0,679609.0
2,use polite or the formal or informal,679610.0,682249.0
2,pronouns these aren't fixed. There's no,682250.0,685278.0
2,clear rule that you can put in a,685279.0,687169.0
2,"textbook to learn, it's that these things",687170.0,689898.0
2,are negotiated and they can change and,689899.0,692028.0
2,people can shift to being informal to,692029.0,693828.0
2,throw someone off or they can become,693829.0,696349.0
2,more formal because they're in the,696350.0,698208.0
2,workspace whereas they might be less,698209.0,699708.0
2,formal if they're hanging out with this,699709.0,701208.0
2,person in some other context. So even for,701209.0,704119.0
2,native speakers there's not always a,704120.0,705859.0
2,kind of fixed rule 'oh this person is my,705860.0,708198.0
2,superior so I will always use the polite,708199.0,710239.0
2,form' or something like that. G: yeah I think that,710240.0,711799.0
2,was one of the things that surprised me is I found,711800.0,713448.0
2,that sometimes I would use the pronouns,713449.0,715729.0
2,inconsistently and I thought that I was,715730.0,718039.0
2,doing something wrong as a non-native,718040.0,719119.0
2,"speaker of French, that I was using 'vous'",719120.0,721099.0
2,"and 'tu' at the same person sometimes, and yet",721100.0,723259.0
2,it turns out that that's something a lot,723260.0,724669.0
2,of people do and to try to negotiate,724670.0,726018.0
2,that. I thought because the,726019.0,727849.0
2,textbooks give you okay we have to,727850.0,729528.0
2,have this dialogue where we officially,729529.0,731509.0
2,say shall we now 'tu' each other and that's,731510.0,734809.0
2,not a dialogue I've actually had very,734810.0,736518.0
2,often. L: yep,736519.0,737059.0
2,"G: because people often figure it out. But yeah,",737060.0,738888.0
2,it's an important question.,738889.0,740239.0
2,Let's move on to third-person pronouns,740240.0,742338.0
2,L: okay G: because there's also a lot of,742339.0,744859.0
2,interesting stuff that goes on with them,744860.0,746448.0
2,L: yep! G: um and one thing that happens with,746449.0,749239.0
2,third-person pronouns is what I have,749240.0,752239.0
2,called in a blog post 'the gay fan,752240.0,754639.0
2,fiction problem'. L: that very serious,754640.0,756499.0
2,linguistic problem. G: it's a very serious,756500.0,758809.0
2,linguistic problem that happens when you,758810.0,762528.0
2,have a narrative with multiple people,762529.0,765439.0
2,"using the same pronoun, and you have to",765440.0,767659.0
2,figure out how you know 'he touched his,767660.0,769849.0

2,parts of the body.,772940.0,773989.0
2,"L: yeah, especially when this has been going",773990.0,775759.0
2,"on for multiple paragraphs. G: yeah, for",775760.0,778189.0
2,"pages and pages and pages, and so you",778190.0,779749.0
2,don't want to necessarily keep repeating,779750.0,781278.0
2,their names. You often get people using,781279.0,783018.0
2,epithets like 'the taller one' or,783019.0,784818.0
2,'the shorter one' but then it's not always,784819.0,786469.0
2,clear you know which character is,786470.0,787759.0
2,"actually taller, which character is shorter,",787760.0,789379.0
2,you then go remember who's taller,789380.0,791568.0
2,who's younger or who... which one is blonde,791569.0,794299.0
2,or something like that if you want to,794300.0,795409.0
2,use description of them. So to try,795410.0,797778.0
2,figure out how do we track multiple,797779.0,800148.0
2,people when we're telling a story with,800149.0,803539.0
2,people and we want to have the,803540.0,804588.0
2,efficiency gain of using pronouns but -,804589.0,806659.0
2,"L: everyone's a 'he', or",806660.0,808049.0
2,everyone's a 'she' G: yeah so one of the,808050.0,810119.0
2,things people ask about pronouns,810120.0,811018.0
2,sometimes is why do we have gender in,811019.0,812999.0
2,"pronouns, and one of the reasons is that",813000.0,815278.0
2,it's a rough-and-ready way of kind of,815279.0,817708.0
2,trying to divide the population into two,817709.0,820379.0
2,equal groups and it's not perfect but,820380.0,822569.0
2,it's better than some of our other,822570.0,824189.0
2,options like dividing people into groups,824190.0,826109.0
2,"of you know tall and short people, or",826110.0,828599.0
2,young and old people or something like,828600.0,830489.0
2,that. Iit kind of works in a lot,830490.0,832739.0
2,of situations that statistically some,832740.0,835799.0
2,people in a group will be male and some,835800.0,837359.0
2,"people in a group will be female. So, you know, it's",837360.0,839729.0
2,not the straight fanfiction problem,839730.0,841169.0
2,because those ones you do have pronouns,841170.0,843929.0
2,to tell apart L: if there are only two,843930.0,845489.0
2,people in an interaction G: well so there's,845490.0,847409.0
2,"two problems, right,",847410.0,847909.0
2,"there's the gay fanfiction problem, and then there's the",847910.0,850229.0
2,orgy fanfic problem - sorry the poly,850230.0,852359.0
2,fanfiction problem and those are two,852360.0,854009.0
2,separate problems.,854010.0,855119.0
2,"L: yep, but when they collide it's very",855120.0,856799.0
2,complicated. G: when they collide it's even,856800.0,858328.0
2,"worse, yeah, then there's 'the gay poly fanfiction",858329.0,860609.0
2,problem'. L: not all languages have this,860610.0,862859.0
2,problem for their gay fanfiction G: I don't,862860.0,865499.0
2,know if all languages write gay fan,865500.0,866669.0
2,fiction but they presumably all tell,866670.0,868259.0
2,stories were multiple people are,868260.0,869699.0
2,involved.,869700.0,870359.0
2,G: Lauren you have an interesting,870360.0,871889.0
2,example of this is not happening?,871890.0,873479.0
2,L: so one example is where you have two,873480.0,877049.0
2,"different, maybe 'he' or 'she' or 'they',",877050.0,880619.0
2,but you have two different versions of,880620.0,882179.0
2,'they' - one that you use for one referent,882180.0,886349.0
2,and one you use for a referent that has,886350.0,888208.0
2,already been discussed and the fancy,888209.0,890278.0
2,word for this is 'logophoric,890279.0,891629.0
2,pronouns'. Essentially what logophoric,891630.0,894239.0
2,pronouns can do is solve the - when you say,894240.0,897989.0
2,something like 'he said that he is,897990.0,900208.0
2,going to cook a barbecue for us on the,900209.0,902309.0
2,weekend'. So in isolation or in an,902310.0,905969.0
2,ongoing context if you're talking about Bob,905970.0,908009.0
2,and Dave and you could say 'Bob said that,908010.0,910619.0
2,Dave's going to cook a barbeque on the weekend' or,910620.0,912328.0
2,'Bob said that Bob himself will cook a,912329.0,914458.0
2,barbecue on the weekend'. But if you're,914459.0,916169.0
2,just using pronouns 'he said that he's,916170.0,917759.0
2,going to cook a barbecue on the weekend',917760.0,919289.0
2,you don't actually know if 'he' is the,919290.0,922049.0
2,person that will do the cooking or if,922050.0,923338.0
2,'he' is assigning someone else that promise.,923339.0,925499.0
2,"And so logophoric pronouns like 'he', 'the",925500.0,928619.0
2,person who is that he will cook a,928620.0,930448.0
2,barbecue' or 'he said that some other him,930449.0,933479.0
2,will cook the barbecue'.,933480.0,935159.0
2,G: yeah so you have a different pronoun for,935160.0,936539.0
2,referring back to the person who was,936540.0,938639.0
2,already speaking vs referring to a,938640.0,940469.0
2,different person from the one who was speaking,940470.0,941669.0
2,"L: yeah, and so I think it would solve that",941670.0,943649.0
2,"'he put his hands on his hips' problem,",943650.0,946229.0
2,where it would become clear if someone's,946230.0,948479.0
2,putting his hands on his own hips or on some,948480.0,950309.0
2,"other dude's hips. G: so I, I don't know if",950310.0,952229.0
2,that solves that problem. It solves the,952230.0,954269.0
2,like 'he said that he loved him' problem. L: oh,954270.0,956849.0
2,yeah G: but I don't know... well I guess in that,956850.0,959279.0
2,case... or you know 'he said that he wanted,959280.0,961019.0
2,to come over' or something... I don't actually,961020.0,962579.0
2,"speak a language with logophors, so don't",962580.0,964349.0
2,know if you can do it with 'he put his,964350.0,965969.0
2,"hand on his hip'. L: no, to be honest I don't",965970.0,967919.0
2,know these languages well enough to make,967920.0,970109.0
2,that promise to be honest. G: what I was,970110.0,971669.0
2,going to say is that one thing that I,971670.0,973499.0
2,know does solve this problem which is,973500.0,975869.0
2,"not logophors, is a different phenomenon",975870.0,977969.0
2,"which is known as obviation, and that's a",977970.0,980129.0
2,"phenomenon where your, pronouns instead",980130.0,982979.0
2,"of having gender, they track how",982980.0,985139.0
2,important someone is to the discourse so,985140.0,987269.0
2,basically you have the more important or,987270.0,989579.0
2,the more central person get one pronoun,989580.0,992099.0
2,and the less important or less central or,992100.0,994439.0
2,less vocal person or persons get a,994440.0,996329.0
2,different pronoun. L: oh I can see that being,996330.0,998129.0
2,handy. G: yeah and so sometimes it's called,998130.0,999989.0
2,third person and fourth person in the,999990.0,1001969.0
2,sense that you know if you have a have a,1001970.0,1003919.0
2,scenario with multiple people in it the,1003920.0,1005749.0
2,third person is obviously more important,1005750.0,1007549.0
2,or more central somehow than the fourth,1007550.0,1009169.0
2,person. And this is of course a,1009170.0,1010489.0
2,"storytelling device, so you know you can",1010490.0,1012799.0
2,decide as the storyteller who is more,1012800.0,1014899.0
2,important to your story. There's no,1014900.0,1016399.0
2,gender involved so either its 'third,1016400.0,1018169.0
2,person put third person's hands on fourth,1018170.0,1020269.0
2,persons hips' or 'third person put third,1020270.0,1022729.0
2,person's hands on third person hips' so,1022730.0,1024979.0
2,you can track who's who along that,1024980.0,1026899.0
2,situation and that allows you to very,1026900.0,1029149.0
2,easily keep track of two different,1029150.0,1031519.0
2,persons and the way you kind of,1031520.0,1034279.0
2,introduce them is when you first say,1034280.0,1035899.0
2,their names or you first say,1035900.0,1037879.0
2,the noun or something that's associated,1037880.0,1039229.0
2,with them that the pronouns are going to,1039230.0,1040879.0
2,have to refer to is you put a little,1040880.0,1042529.0
2,marker on the names like a suffix that,1042530.0,1044449.0
2,indicates that this one is going to be,1044450.0,1046339.0
2,your third person one and this is going,1046340.0,1047599.0
2,to be your fourth person one and then,1047600.0,1048709.0
2,afterwards you can just refer back to,1048710.0,1049939.0
2,them with that. L: nice G: so it's very,1049940.0,1051409.0
2,interesting from a storytelling,1051410.0,1052459.0
2,perspective because then you can retell,1052460.0,1054079.0
2,the story the same way if you just swap,1054080.0,1056269.0
2,"which one is obviative, which one is",1056270.0,1058459.0
2,fourth person. L: yep,1058460.0,1059329.0
2,G: then the story gets completely,1059330.0,1060619.0
2,different focus which is kind of interesting. L: huh G: yeah,1060620.0,1062809.0
2,L: cool G: so obviation does a great job of,1062810.0,1065119.0
2,solving the gay fanfiction problem. It,1065120.0,1066949.0
2,doesn't do a whole lot to solve the poly,1066950.0,1069799.0
2,fanfiction problem because generally you,1069800.0,1071989.0
2,have a third person a fourth person and,1071990.0,1074359.0
2,so if you end up,1074360.0,1075229.0
2,with 4 or 5 people in a scenario that's not -,1075230.0,1077449.0
2,L: it's not enough to pronouns to go around.,1077450.0,1079399.0
2,G: yeah some languages have a more obscure,1079400.0,1082279.0
2,pronoun known as the 'further obviate',1082280.0,1084529.0
2,which is like a fifth person so you can have,1084530.0,1086599.0
2,like three people of various levels of,1086600.0,1088249.0
2,important in this scenario but I haven't,1088250.0,1089869.0
2,seen it used a whole lot because I guess making this distinction two,1089870.0,1093619.0
2,ways is enough for a lot of languages.,1093620.0,1095359.0
2,L: and of course there are set of,1095360.0,1096949.0
2,languages where none of this is a,1096950.0,1098689.0
2,"problem at all, and they are sign",1098690.0,1100639.0
2,languages that use spatial locations for,1100640.0,1103459.0
2,pronominal reference. So in sign,1103460.0,1106219.0
2,"languages, generally what happens is to",1106220.0,1108979.0
2,make the equivalent of a pronoun in a,1108980.0,1111109.0
2,"language like English, they all sign",1111110.0,1113298.0
2,someone's name or a reference to someone,1113299.0,1115668.0
2,or their actions in a particular space and,1115669.0,1118279.0
2,then that space will be used to call,1118280.0,1119749.0
2,back to that person throughout the,1119750.0,1121399.0
2,interaction. Or the person can move,1121400.0,1122839.0
2,around in the kind of signing space but,1122840.0,1125269.0
2,they're always able to be spatially,1125270.0,1127279.0
2,referred to. G: so signing space could be like,1127280.0,1129259.0
2,'top left' or 'towards the right of the,1129260.0,1131509.0
2,person' who's signing or something like,1131510.0,1132949.0
2,that.,1132950.0,1133459.0
2,"L: yeah. I mean, when you speak English and you",1133460.0,1135709.0
2,gesture across a narrative you're,1135710.0,1137269.0
2,possibly doing this without really,1137270.0,1138949.0
2,thinking about it anyway so you may be,1138950.0,1140839.0
2,referring to -,1140840.0,1142428.0
2,"who were my barbecuers again, Bob and Dave?",1142429.0,1144798.0
2,G: yeah,1144799.0,1145849.0
2,L: Bob and Dave might get referred to one... you,1145850.0,1150019.0
2,"know, Bob's on the left, Dave's on the right and",1150020.0,1151879.0
2,I kind of keep referring to them and,1151880.0,1153439.0
2,"gesturing throughout the interaction, but",1153440.0,1154939.0
2,in sign languages like Auslan which is,1154940.0,1157279.0
2,the one I kind of know this type of example from,1157280.0,1159469.0
2,"best, Bob will get put in a particular",1159470.0,1161359.0
2,space and he'll be signed there and then,1161360.0,1163668.0
2,he'll kind of keeping called back to,1163669.0,1165798.0
2,from there. G: so if the barbecue is to the left,1165799.0,1168199.0
2,of us and Bob's by the barbecue that we set,1168200.0,1170569.0
2,"up the barbecue on the left, we set up Bob",1170570.0,1172339.0
2,near the BBQ and then we have Dave over,1172340.0,1174349.0
2,by the house on the right. L: yeah G: something like that.,1174350.0,1175969.0
2,"L: and so if Bob says something, I'll sign",1175970.0,1178039.0
2,what Bob said in the left-hand space G: or,1178040.0,1180859.0
2,kind of turn your body towards that,1180860.0,1182329.0
2,space L: yeah G: as if you're speaking from,1182330.0,1183889.0
2,Bob's perspective,1183890.0,1184909.0
2,L: yeah G: I don't know much ASL but I've seen,1184910.0,1186889.0
2,people talk about this in ASL as well.,1186890.0,1187389.0
2,L: it's a very elegant solution. G: it's,1187390.0,1190729.0
2,beautiful and the nice thing about it is,1190730.0,1192678.0
2,you're not limited to just having people,1192679.0,1194239.0
2,on the left or people on the right because you,1194240.0,1195709.0
2,"could have someone that's kind of like 'top-left',",1195710.0,1197449.0
2,"'bottom-left', 'top right', 'bottom right' L: yeah",1197450.0,1200689.0
2,I don't know what the maximum number...,1200690.0,1202758.0
2,I guess it's however many people can,1202759.0,1204198.0
2,kind of keep track of in the narrative.,1204199.0,1205848.0
2,G: I feel like I've heard someone say seven,1205849.0,1208128.0
2,but that might be false.,1208129.0,1209208.0
2,"L: a good storyteller, surely G: yeah if",1209209.0,1211218.0
2,you're like a really good storyteller,1211219.0,1212868.0
2,"you can keep track, just kind of fan them out",1212869.0,1214398.0
2,around your face.,1214399.0,1215418.0
2,L: yep G: but definitely you can do more than,1215419.0,1216678.0
2,"two, which is fantastic and it doesn't",1216679.0,1218058.0
2,matter anything about their gender,1218059.0,1218988.0
2,because you can just set them up,1218989.0,1220218.0
2,wherever you want.,1220219.0,1220939.0
2,"L: gender doesn't matter, number doesn't",1220940.0,1222588.0
2,"matter, all of those kind of things.",1222589.0,1224448.0
2,G: so sign languages have solved the gay,1224449.0,1226819.0
2,"fan fiction orgy problem, all other",1226820.0,1228798.0
2,languages will have to figure out how to,1228799.0,1230689.0
2,do that.,1230690.0,1231258.0
2,"L: playing catch-up, really G: yeah you know or just",1231259.0,1232878.0
2,learn a sign language so that you can,1232879.0,1234319.0
2,write better fanfiction.,1234320.0,1235308.0
2,L: yeah G: bet that's a good reason L: the obvious,1235309.0,1236898.0
2,solution G: the clear and obvious solution!,1236899.0,1239478.0
2,So we we talked about language typology,1239479.0,1242358.0
2,"systems, but another thing that comes up",1242359.0,1244428.0
2,in English and other languages is the,1244429.0,1246198.0
2,idea of a gender-neutral pronoun,1246199.0,1247488.0
2,especially in the third person.,1247489.0,1248718.0
2,L: yeah we are technically unable to do,1248719.0,1250698.0
2,this podcast on pronouns without,1250699.0,1252498.0
2,"mentioning English singular they, it would",1252499.0,1254538.0
2,be a crime. G: because it's the one that,1254539.0,1255588.0
2,keeps making the headlines. L: it's been very,1255589.0,1257358.0
2,"popular, it was Word of the Year for the American",1257359.0,1259548.0
2,Dialect Society last year in 2015.,1259549.0,1262818.0
2,G: yes it was! I was there that vote and we,1262819.0,1265548.0
2,were pretty excited about it.,1265549.0,1266718.0
2,L: did did you vote for singular they? G: yes of course,1266719.0,1268728.0
2,"I did, I actually wrote a whole article",1268729.0,1270468.0
2,nominating it for word of the year. L: so,1270469.0,1272898.0
2,what even is singular they? G: so singular they,1272899.0,1275358.0
2,is the use of they which is traditionally,1275359.0,1279439.0
2,thought of as - and I'm going to put a large,1279440.0,1281328.0
2,asterisk besides this because I'm going to,1281329.0,1282648.0
2,get back to that - as a plural third,1282649.0,1285678.0
2,"person pronoun, as a singular pronoun. And",1285679.0,1288588.0
2,"it is not a new thing in English, this is",1288589.0,1292428.0
2,why I wanted to but an asterisk by that use of 'traditionally',1292429.0,1294498.0
2,because using they in a singular form is,1294499.0,1297348.0
2,actually very very old. So this is,1297349.0,1299448.0
2,examples like if you say 'someone left,1299449.0,1302058.0
2,their umbrella' and you don't know whose,1302059.0,1303828.0
2,umbrella it is but generally people,1303829.0,1305088.0
2,don't share in joint ownership of,1305089.0,1306828.0
2,"umbrellas, probably. L: not in this day and age",1306829.0,1310878.0
2,of affordable umbrellas and when you say,1310879.0,1312828.0
2,"it's not recent,",1312829.0,1314538.0
2,Jane Austen used singular they in this,1314539.0,1316728.0
2,"context, Shakespeare used singular they in",1316729.0,1319038.0
2,"this context. G: Chaucer used singular they,",1319039.0,1321348.0
2,"it goes all the way back to Old English, in",1321349.0,1322968.0
2,fact singular 'they' is only about a,1322969.0,1324558.0
2,hundred years younger than singular 'you'.,1324559.0,1327078.0
2,L: right G: so if you remember when we started,1327079.0,1328728.0
2,"losing 'thou' L: oh yeah I remember that, back in the day. G: I know",1328729.0,1332658.0
2,just get in your time travel box and go,1332659.0,1335058.0
2,back to when people started using,1335059.0,1336409.0
2,"'you' for singular, then jump forward about",1336410.0,1338959.0
2,a hundred years and you'll hear people,1338960.0,1340909.0
2,starting to use they as singular. In,1340910.0,1342589.0
2,fact I don't know maybe they were using,1342590.0,1343609.0
2,earlier it's just when we have written,1343610.0,1344839.0
2,records. L: prove it to us with an example,1344840.0,1348109.0
2,"G: yeah, so this is going to be me badly",1348110.0,1350839.0
2,pronouncing Middle English L: Yessss G: because I am,1350840.0,1353569.0
2,not an English historian. So this is from,1353570.0,1357019.0
2,"Chaucer 'The Pardoner's' prologue, around",1357020.0,1359929.0
2,"1395, which goes 'and who so findeth him",1359930.0,1364429.0
2,out of switchblane they will come up',1364430.0,1367969.0
2,and so this means approximately 'and,1367970.0,1370459.0
2,whoever finds him whatever out of,1370460.0,1372679.0
2,switchblane means they will come up'. So,1372680.0,1374779.0
2,this whoever is a nonspecific singular,1374780.0,1377509.0
2,person and you can tell it's singular,1377510.0,1379009.0
2,because it's using the conjugation 'findeth',1379010.0,1381199.0
2,and then 'they' is being used to refer,1381200.0,1383719.0
2,back to 'who so'.,1383720.0,1384829.0
2,"L: yeah, okay G: so here's one from 1489, which",1384830.0,1388729.0
2,goes 'each of them should make themself,1388730.0,1391309.0
2,ready' so that the example of singular,1391310.0,1393169.0
2,'themself' from Caxton. L: he is also old G: he is,1393170.0,1396259.0
2,"also very old, and here's the Shakespeare",1396260.0,1398209.0
2,example which goes 'there's not a man I,1398210.0,1400729.0
2,meet but doth salute me and I were their,1400730.0,1403699.0

2,"it, must be legit G: Shakespeare said it,",1409610.0,1411289.0
2,"must be legit. L: right, so this is not a new",1411290.0,1413899.0
2,"and exciting thing, why the hell was it",1413900.0,1415369.0
2,Word of the Year last year?,1415370.0,1416749.0
2,G: yeah so why talk about it as if it's,1416750.0,1418729.0
2,something new. Well for one reason it's a...,1418730.0,1420889.0
2,Word of the Year doesn't have to be,1420890.0,1422389.0
2,"brand-new it's generally 'newly prominent',",1422390.0,1425899.0
2,"so people are talking about it more, and",1425900.0,1428179.0
2,when you looked at what types of words,1428180.0,1430579.0
2,people were talking about singular they,1430580.0,1432379.0
2,showed up in there. I did a Google N-gram,1432380.0,1434119.0
2,search that showed that people were,1434120.0,1435979.0
2,"searching for it more, it seemed to be",1435980.0,1438019.0
2,there was a meeting of the American Copy,1438020.0,1440779.0
2,Editor Society which Ben Zimmer was at,1440780.0,1443329.0
2,and reported on people talking about,1443330.0,1444829.0
2,singular they a lot there and then a lot,1444830.0,1446599.0
2,of people read Ben Zimmer's article,1446600.0,1448159.0
2,about the copy editors meeting and thought,1448160.0,1450079.0
2,'oh well that's interesting' so there was,1450080.0,1452059.0
2,a lot of talking about singular they.,1452060.0,1453829.0
2,L: right G: and what a lot of people were,1453830.0,1455899.0
2,talking about with singular they was not,1455900.0,1458329.0
2,"just this non specific usage, this stuff",1458330.0,1460969.0
2,like you know 'each of them should make,1460970.0,1463069.0
2,themself ready' or you know 'and whoever,1463070.0,1465829.0
2,"finds him they should come',",1465830.0,1468139.0
2,it's this specific usage,1468140.0,1470209.0
2,"for a particular person, which is also",1470210.0,1472819.0
2,"not completely new, but not as old as",1472820.0,1474529.0
2,Shakespeare. L: right. So older examples it's,1474530.0,1476959.0
2,talking about 'they' as in it could,1476960.0,1478579.0
2,be anyone.,1478580.0,1479509.0
2,Whereas now it's about a specific,1479510.0,1481189.0
2,person in the way that 'you' is about a,1481190.0,1483259.0
2,specific person or 'he' or 'she'.,1483260.0,1485239.0
2,"G: yeah so it's about a specific person, so in",1485240.0,1487009.0
2,the way that I prefer people refer to me,1487010.0,1489439.0
2,"as, ah, with the pronoun 'she' and 'her' when",1489440.0,1492049.0
2,they're talking about me in second,1492050.0,1493039.0
2,person.,1493040.0,1493579.0
2,Some people say 'could you please refer,1493580.0,1495229.0
2,to me using the pronouns 'they' and 'them',1495230.0,1497299.0
2,when you're talking about me in the,1497300.0,1498469.0
2,third person' and that's something that's,1498470.0,1500419.0
2,a newer phenomenon. L: yep G: so referring to,1500420.0,1502489.0
2,someone as 'they' as a specific person so,1502490.0,1504559.0
2,if you say something like 'Alex looked at,1504560.0,1506569.0
2,themselves in the mirror'.,1506570.0,1507769.0
2,L: yeah G: and so you have singular they there. L: yep,1507770.0,1509359.0
2,G: because the thing is for the nonspecific,1509360.0,1511339.0
2,kind of singular they you can often kind of,1511340.0,1513679.0
2,find a way to write around if you're not,1513680.0,1515629.0
2,a fan. You can recast the sentence in the,1515630.0,1517879.0
2,"plural or you can, you know, use a passive",1517880.0,1520729.0
2,or you can kind of do various things to try,1520730.0,1522559.0
2,to get rid of that they if you're really,1522560.0,1523879.0
2,determined that it can only be singular.,1523880.0,1525799.0
2,L: yeah G: for an individual person who says,1525800.0,1528109.0
2,you know 'please refer to me as they',1528110.0,1529429.0
2,"the only way to get around that is our, you know,",1529430.0,1532099.0
2,is kind of our gay fanfiction problem,1532100.0,1533539.0
2,where you have to refer to them by their,1533540.0,1534589.0
2,name every single time. L: and that's just,1534590.0,1536569.0
2,creepy.,1536570.0,1537229.0
2,G: it's just creepy! It gets really weird,1537230.0,1540049.0
2,sounding really quickly,1540050.0,1541939.0
2,L: yeah I mean unless that's a person's,1541940.0,1543379.0
2,preference and then as well as you can,1543380.0,1545749.0
2,deal with the cognitive load of that fair,1545750.0,1547639.0
2,enough. G: yeah it is definitely a lot more,1547640.0,1548929.0
2,difficult if you don't have any pronouns,1548930.0,1550279.0
2,at all to refer to someone.,1550280.0,1551599.0
2,L: yeah G: so singular they as an individual,1551600.0,1553459.0
2,pronoun for specific person is a,1553460.0,1555349.0
2,phenomenon that people have been,1555350.0,1556909.0
2,"advocating for a lot more recently, and it's gotten",1556910.0,1559189.0
2,a lot more visibility and then that becomes,1559190.0,1561049.0
2,kind of 'well if you're going to accept,1561050.0,1563059.0
2,singular they to refer to a specific,1563060.0,1565039.0
2,"person,",1565040.0,1565909.0
2,why not let the nonspecific use in by the,1565910.0,1568099.0
2,back door while we're at it'.,1568100.0,1569509.0
2,L: yeah it's a much easier way to just... you're,1569510.0,1572269.0
2,just kind of creating a... just pushing a,1572270.0,1574129.0
2,little in the paradigm and creating a,1574130.0,1575749.0
2,little space that people are,1575750.0,1577339.0
2,increasingly finding is necessary and it,1577340.0,1580039.0
2,may feel a bit weird now and I know some,1580040.0,1582079.0
2,people really struggle to find it,1582080.0,1584659.0
2,grammatically acceptable but I think,1584660.0,1587119.0
2,over time it will normalize and a good,1587120.0,1588919.0
2,example of the likelihood of that is,1588920.0,1590959.0
2,from Sweden. So Sweden has a 'she' and 'he',1590960.0,1593809.0
2,equivalent it's 'hon' and 'han' - I'm,1593810.0,1595939.0
2,"definitely not saying those right, sorry",1595940.0,1597949.0
2,Swedish people. But now Swedish speakers,1597950.0,1600799.0
2,officially have the option,1600800.0,1603199.0
2,using a gender-neutral form 'hen'.,1603200.0,1605898.0
2,"Officially, as in like it's now in all",1605899.0,1608089.0
2,government documents and legal anything,1608090.0,1611119.0
2,where it doesn't need to refer to,1611120.0,1612528.0
2,"someone specifically as male or female,",1612529.0,1614418.0
2,the form 'hen' can now be used.,1614419.0,1617119.0
2,G: yeah and we know that even if,1617120.0,1618888.0
2,the current generation of speakers have,1618889.0,1620359.0
2,"a bit of difficulty with it, if you",1620360.0,1621678.0
2,expose kids to something it's something,1621679.0,1623418.0
2,they can learn in particular.,1623419.0,1624739.0
2,General neutral pronouns are things that,1624740.0,1626058.0
2,many languages have and so there's no,1626059.0,1627619.0
2,reason why kids can't learn that in,1627620.0,1629148.0
2,"English as well, even if it's a bit",1629149.0,1630709.0
2,harder for an adult. Adults can learn,1630710.0,1632569.0
2,whole new languages.,1632570.0,1634069.0
2,It takes some effort but you can learn a new,1634070.0,1635509.0
2,"language, like learning some new pronouns",1635510.0,1637939.0
2,"for a given language, yeah it takes some",1637940.0,1639888.0
2,"effort but it's not impossible. L: No, my",1639889.0,1642829.0
2,"feeling is, if someone wants to be",1642830.0,1644239.0
2,"called by whatever pronouns they want to,",1644240.0,1647028.0
2,they've generally gone through a lot,1647029.0,1648918.0
2,more massive process in their life to,1648919.0,1651319.0
2,come to that decision and feel,1651320.0,1652729.0
2,comfortable with sharing it with people than,1652730.0,1653229.0
2,I have to go through to change a very,1653230.0,1656479.0
2,tiny part of my linguistic behaviour.,1656480.0,1658459.0
2,G: yeah I feel like it hurts the other,1658460.0,1659959.0
2,person more for me not to use their,1659960.0,1661609.0
2,correct pronouns than it does for me to,1661610.0,1663589.0
2,figure out how to use those myself.,1663590.0,1665449.0
2,L: yeah G: yeah so singular they is one of the,1665450.0,1668028.0
2,most visible of these gender neutral,1668029.0,1670638.0
2,third-person pronouns for English,1670639.0,1672349.0
2,because it has this nonspecific use that's,1672350.0,1674239.0
2,"been going on for a long time, but there",1674240.0,1675829.0
2,is also a whole set of other nonspecific,1675830.0,1678349.0
2,third-person pronouns that are used in,1678350.0,1679699.0
2,English. L: so people have come up with,1679700.0,1681469.0
2,other suggestions to kind of fill the,1681470.0,1683989.0
2,paradigm but not mean that we have the,1683990.0,1685638.0
2,same problem that we have with 'you' where it,1685639.0,1687319.0
2,can be singular or plural.,1687320.0,1688668.0
2,G: yeah so there's a whole bunch of those and they,1688669.0,1690168.0
2,actually go back to the 1850's.,1690169.0,1691638.0
2,L: really?! I didn't know they were that old,1691639.0,1693648.0
2,G: yeah so the earlier usage insofar that,1693649.0,1696109.0
2,there are records of it because I,1696110.0,1697548.0
2,haven't been able to find ones on the,1697549.0,1699079.0
2,you know non-binary activism side but,1699080.0,1701479.0
2,"maybe they exist, but the one that I have",1701480.0,1703398.0
2,records of are grammarian saying 'well,1703399.0,1705918.0
2,gosh we can't deal with this plural,1705919.0,1708798.0
2,pronoun being used for the singular so,1708799.0,1710959.0
2,let's invent one for the singular,1710960.0,1712249.0
2,because clearly it's necessary to have a,1712250.0,1714439.0
2,non-gender alternative for the singular'.,1714440.0,1716239.0
2,"So they're approaching it, at least the",1716240.0,1717678.0
2,"record that i'm aware of, are approaching it",1717679.0,1719359.0
2,from a grammatical perspective initially.,1719360.0,1720979.0
2,L: I love that,1720980.0,1722058.0
2,G: yeah so the term is 'epicene pronoun' L: mmmhmmm G: and,1722059.0,1725749.0
2,it goes way back,1725750.0,1726678.0
2,L: there you go. Do you know what the original,1726679.0,1727759.0
2,candidate suggestion was or what the,1727760.0,1730219.0
2,suggestions were? G: so there's this lovely,1730220.0,1732138.0
2,website from Dennis Baron at the,1732139.0,1734599.0
2,"University of Illinois, and he has a chronology of early",1734600.0,1738558.0
2,non-binary pronouns L: right G: and oh wow -,1738559.0,1741499.0
2,sorry -,1741500.0,1742369.0
2,the earliest examples from 1792 that he,1742370.0,1745758.0
2,has. L: right! G: and this is the Scottish,1745759.0,1748518.0
2,"economist and philosopher James Anderson,",1748519.0,1750619.0
2,who writes an article arguing for the,1750620.0,1753229.0
2,usefulness of an indeterminate pronoun,1753230.0,1755959.0
2,like the pronoun 'oo' recently reported,1755960.0,1758209.0
2,in provincial use. Dennis Barron,1758210.0,1760579.0
2,goes on to say that in fact Anderson,1760580.0,1762619.0
2,went overboard suggesting that English,1762620.0,1764178.0
2,would benefit from 13 genders including,1764179.0,1770089.0
2,two indefinite or common gender pronouns,1770090.0,1772518.0
2,L: well he's trying to solve the poly gay,1772519.0,1775579.0
2,fanfiction orgy scenario. G: oh yeah,1775580.0,1778398.0
2,"wow this is really interesting, um so I'm",1778399.0,1780829.0
2,just looking at this list... L: this is what happens,1780830.0,1782839.0
2,when you do research while reading it out,1782840.0,1784699.0
2,loud Gretchen. G: the,1784700.0,1785148.0
2,internet is beautiful! So if you look at,1785149.0,1787398.0
2,his list he has to denote male animals,1787399.0,1790668.0
2,alone; L: right,1790669.0,1791928.0
2,G: female animals alone; inanimate objects,1791929.0,1794119.0
2,alone; animate objects which either express a,1794120.0,1796788.0
2,general class or whole genus or where it,1796789.0,1798979.0
2,"is not necessary to specify sex at all,",1798980.0,1800508.0
2,animals known to be castrated and meant,1800509.0,1803359.0
2,"to be distinguished as such,",1803360.0,1804888.0
2,"L: ok G: male and females known to be such,",1804889.0,1807888.0
2,though not meant to be separated - this is,1807889.0,1810109.0
2,what he calls the matrimonial gender L: urrrgh G: so,1810110.0,1813018.0
2,"he's not gay enough - males only, part",1813019.0,1817069.0
2,"perfect and part castrated. Oh, perfect",1817070.0,1819168.0
2,"being non castrated, hmm that's an",1819169.0,1821209.0
2,interesting terminology; females and,1821210.0,1823339.0
2,"castrata; males, females and castrata; males",1823340.0,1826548.0
2,and inanimates conjoined; females and inanimates,1826549.0,1829069.0
2,"conjoined; males, females and inanimates conjoined -",1829070.0,1831319.0
2,these are not matrimonial gendered L: I am tired!,1831320.0,1835308.0
2,"G: males, females and inanimates either",1835309.0,1839388.0
2,separated or conjoined where no,1839389.0,1840888.0
2,distinction gender was to be meant it,1840889.0,1842599.0
2,was averted to in anyway this precisely the,1842600.0,1844788.0
2,power of present pronoun they. So that's finally his,1844789.0,1846528.0
2,13th gender pronoun. L: Phew! I've forgotten the,1846529.0,1849199.0
2,first one now.,1849200.0,1850308.0
2,G: yeah so 13 genders probably not,1850309.0,1855648.0
2,"necessary, but this is the proposal",1855649.0,1858229.0
2,"from 1792, and then just two years later",1858230.0,1860599.0
2,there's another article providing a,1860600.0,1863538.0
2,"critique, explanation and defense of",1863539.0,1866268.0
2,"singular the, and another call for the",1866269.0,1868518.0
2,coining of a common,1868519.0,1869519.0
2,gender pronoun. L: There we go G: and we get when we have,1869520.0,1871409.0
2,"1808, someone suggesting that we use 'it'",1871410.0,1874259.0
2,for our gender neutral pronoun L: I think 'zee' and,1874260.0,1877949.0
2,'zere' is the one I know of that had kind,1877950.0,1881759.0
2,of the most traction.,1881760.0,1882839.0
2,G: yeah so 'xe' and 'xir' is one of the best-known,1882840.0,1885839.0
2,ones and it does not show up in the,1885840.0,1887729.0
2,early list. So there's a whole bunch of,1887730.0,1889589.0
2,early proposals for gender neutral,1889590.0,1891299.0
2,pronouns and we'll include a link to this,1891300.0,1893309.0
2,fantastic page about them. L: fabulous G: but the,1893310.0,1896489.0
2,best-known one at the moment I think is,1896490.0,1898769.0
2,'xe/xir' which is spelled a couple,1898770.0,1900509.0
2,"different ways, there's 'xe', 'xir', 'xie', 'xer',",1900510.0,1906929.0
2,couple different options there. L: yep G: oh,1906930.0,1909599.0
2,some people spell it with a 'z' as,1909600.0,1911099.0
2,"well, 'zie' or 'ze', but as far as I",1911100.0,1913769.0
2,know people generally pronounce the 'x' one,1913770.0,1915389.0
2,"as also a 'z' L: yep, so English pronouns",1915390.0,1919139.0
2,have been changing as long as there has,1919140.0,1921149.0
2,been English and they will continue to,1921150.0,1923099.0
2,change whether that's the inclusion of,1923100.0,1924899.0
2,singular they or 'xe' becoming more,1924900.0,1927449.0
2,popular. Maybe we'll finally go back to,1927450.0,1929639.0
2,having a plural you form that everyone,1929640.0,1932009.0
2,agrees on. G: yeah I think we're on our way,1932010.0,1933569.0
2,"to a 'you' form, but you know we definitely",1933570.0,1935819.0
2,haven't gotten there. Maybe if we have singular,1935820.0,1937499.0
2,they then we'll end up with like 'they all',1937500.0,1938909.0
2,"or 'th'all', like with 'you all' and 'y'all' '",1938910.0,1939409.0

2,"does not work for me, I guess you could",1945690.0,1946919.0
2,have 'those guys' but then you run,1946920.0,1948299.0
2,"into a gender problem, so L: yep G: probably I",1948300.0,1950489.0
2,"don't support that one. But 'th'all', I don't",1950490.0,1952859.0
2,"know, I can get my head around that, because then you",1952860.0,1953909.0
2,have this nice like 'y'all/th'all' paradigm,1953910.0,1954409.0
2,"L: 'th'all' G: yeah L: yeah I like it G: ya L: there you go, we've",1954410.0,1959579.0
2,solved English for you. G: we've solved it and now,1959580.0,1962309.0
2,we just need to make everyone else do,1962310.0,1964169.0
2,"the thing which as we've seen is, is",1964170.0,1966269.0

3,L:Welcome to lingthusiasm! A podcast that's,4790.0,8239.0
3,enthusiastic about linguistics. I'm,8240.0,10699.0
3,Lauren Gawne G:and I'm Gretchen McCulloch,10700.0,12708.0
3,and today we're going to be talking,12709.0,13789.0
3,"about the linguist film, Arrival. But first",13790.0,17778.0
3,Lauren what have you been up to these,17779.0,19188.0
3,days? L: I am enjoying getting a fair amount,19189.0,22999.0
3,of work done and published which is a,23000.0,25159.0
3,rare and exciting feat in academia,25160.0,27618.0
3,sometimes. So I have a descriptive,27619.0,31098.0
3,grammar of Yolmo which is the language,31099.0,33049.0
3,that I worked with for my PhD and that's,33050.0,36859.0
3,now available. I'm really excited because,36860.0,38449.0
3,it's an open-access book which means,38450.0,40369.0
3,that anyone can download it and read it,40370.0,42199.0
3,for free,42200.0,43009.0
3,G: yay! L: I'll put the link to that in the,43010.0,44779.0
3,show notes for those who are in any,44780.0,47119.0
3,way interested in the grammar of Tibetan,47120.0,50089.0
3,dialects of languages spoken in Nepal.,50090.0,52219.0
3,I know many of you are. But it's really really,52220.0,54409.0
3,exciting. G: It's a bit niche. L: yeah you've,54410.0,58219.0
3,seen Arrival - now read detailed,58220.0,60738.0
3,descriptions of the distribution of,60739.0,62269.0
3,ergativity!,62270.0,63229.0
3,"Now, that's been happening and i'm going",63230.0,66499.0
3,to a conference called LDLT so it's,66500.0,68658.0
3,language documentation and linguistic,68659.0,70429.0
3,theory in december at SOAS university which,70430.0,74599.0
3,is also the university i'm at. So a no,74600.0,76699.0
3,travel required conference - always a,76700.0,78469.0
3,bonus! So if there's anything interesting,78470.0,81019.0
3,to report there i will report back G: i,81020.0,83599.0
3,look forward to hearing about it,83600.0,85009.0
3,L: what have you been up to? G: I have been,85010.0,86749.0
3,working away in the background on my,86750.0,88969.0
3,book about internet language and the,88970.0,91309.0
3,future of English. Which is something,91310.0,92779.0
3,that occupies a lot of my time but,92780.0,94699.0
3,currently has nothing that I can share,94700.0,96228.0
3,"with people, so.",96229.0,97728.0
3,Yeah. I'm trying to get the second draft,97729.0,99798.0
3,"done and into my editor so, you know,",99799.0,102048.0
3,it's making progress!,102049.0,103129.0
3,it's taking shape to be a,103130.0,105228.0
3,real book which is exciting. L: yay! G: but,105229.0,107569.0
3,there's still a lot of editing ahead of,107570.0,109429.0
3,me. i also just got back from EmojiCon,109430.0,112519.0
3,"which is a conference about emoji, where",112520.0,115069.0
3,I met some members of the Unicode,115070.0,117079.0
3,Consortium. That's the shadowy committee that,117080.0,119059.0
3,decides which emoji we have. I had a lot,119060.0,121579.0
3,of conversations about what types of,121580.0,122868.0
3,things should be represented and,122869.0,124429.0
3,what the role of a technological,124430.0,125809.0
3,standard is implementing that. So I think,125810.0,127519.0
3,that's really interesting because it's,127520.0,129438.0
3,kind of the opposite of how dictionaries,129439.0,131059.0
3,work. Like dictionaries are just playing,131060.0,132469.0
3,catch-up you know people decide to use,132470.0,134208.0
3,words and then the dictionary adds them,134209.0,135679.0
3,whereas for emoji because they're a,135680.0,137388.0
3,technological thing,137389.0,138439.0
3,the committee has to decide first based,138440.0,140509.0
3,on sometimes shadowy evidence for,140510.0,142309.0
3,whether or not an emoji is going to be,142310.0,143659.0
3,desired by a lot of people. So that was very,143660.0,145969.0
3,interesting.,145970.0,146659.0
3,L: it's funny occasionally at the moment I,146660.0,148309.0
3,"message someone and I'm just like 'ah, I",148310.0,150019.0
3,wish there was an emoji for this thing,150020.0,151819.0
3,it would be really handy right now.' So,151820.0,153769.0
3,all i have to do is lobby the unicode,153770.0,156409.0
3,"consortium apparently. G: yeah, you can write a",156410.0,158389.0
3,proposal. you make like a PDF document,158390.0,160009.0
3,that has the reasons and some kind of,160010.0,162319.0
3,"google trends data, to try to provide",162320.0,164659.0
3,some sort of justification for whether,164660.0,166189.0
3,people are searching for it or whether people,166190.0,167569.0
3,are tagging stuff with that on Instagram.,167570.0,169099.0
3,Or something like whether it's a concept,169100.0,170779.0
3,that's being used -- because I mean,170780.0,172129.0
3,obviously if it's just something very,172130.0,173779.0
3,obscure they're going to say no.,173780.0,175549.0
3,L: hmm! G: so if you ever want to write an,175550.0,177499.0
3,emoji proposal i can point you to where,177500.0,179239.0
3,do that,179240.0,179869.0
3,"L: There you go, I learned a thing today",179870.0,191559.0
3,"G: shall we talk about Arrival? L: Yes. I mean, I",191560.0,194379.0
3,feel like I've been talking about,194380.0,195249.0
3,nothing else but maybe people who aren't,195250.0,197769.0
3,linguists haven't been quite as excited,197770.0,201129.0
3,as linguist internet has been about the,201130.0,203979.0
3,"film arrival. G: Yeah, the linguist internet has been",203980.0,206019.0
3,very excited about it but i also have,206020.0,208749.0
3,the linguist who consulted for arrival,208750.0,211509.0
3,on my facebook so I've been seeing all,211510.0,213009.0
3,her posts about it. L: not only do you have,213010.0,214659.0
3,her on your facebook but she was like,214660.0,216129.0
3,your teacher right?,216130.0,217208.0
3,G:yeah she was my advisor in grad school I,217209.0,218949.0
3,worked with her on my thesis. L: that is,218950.0,220749.0
3,amazing.,220750.0,221619.0
3,"So, for people who don't know what the",221620.0,224229.0
3,film arrival is about you saw it slightly,224230.0,226029.0
3,more recently than me Gretchen so it's,226030.0,227768.0
3,you know a week fresher in your brain G: so,227769.0,230679.0
3,Amy Adams plays a linguistics professor,230680.0,233139.0
3,and the linguistics professor gets,233140.0,236048.0
3,"called upon to-- Aliens arrived! Sorry,",236049.0,238899.0
3,aliens arrived and nobody can talk with,238900.0,241659.0
3,them. L: I love that you start with the,241660.0,242859.0
3,linguistics professor. There's a inguistics,242860.0,244749.0
3,professor! G: yeah I start with the linguistics,244750.0,246309.0
3,professor because that's clearly the most,246310.0,247479.0
3,"important part, but there are also aliens and",247480.0,249429.0
3,no one can communicate with them because,249430.0,250568.0
3,they're aliens and we don't have a,250569.0,252009.0
3,universal translator 'cause that's not a real,252010.0,253568.0
3,thing guys.,253569.0,254379.0
3,And so the military comes knocking on,254380.0,256208.0
3,"her door and says 'hey, can you figure out",256209.0,258578.0
3,how to talk to these aliens for us?' And,258579.0,260499.0
3,"she's like, 'Yeah I guess ok.' And she goes",260500.0,264159.0
3,"and tries to figure out, you know,",264160.0,266319.0
3,what they have in common and what they,266320.0,268059.0
3,can talk about and kind of builds up,268060.0,269889.0
3,from basic words into more complicated,269890.0,272439.0
3,stuff. So she can finally ask them what,272440.0,274449.0
3,is their purpose on earth? What are they,274450.0,275619.0
3,doing here? And then like stuff happens. I,275620.0,277779.0
3,think this is going to be a spoilery,277780.0,279159.0
3,review because the movie's been out long,279160.0,281138.0
3,enough.,281139.0,281679.0
3,L: we're not doing this so shortly afterwards,281680.0,283779.0
3,If people are listening to this,283780.0,284978.0
3,they've had plenty of opportunity to see,284979.0,286599.0
3,the film. Or press pause right now and,286600.0,289388.0
3,"come back. G: Press pause, go watch the film,",289389.0,291939.0
3,come back when you have seen it! L: so the,291940.0,294939.0
3,reason that this film has endeared itself,294940.0,297309.0
3,to linguists and the general word nerd,297310.0,300309.0
3,community is that it is a relatively,300310.0,303009.0
3,authentic representation of the kind of,303010.0,305168.0
3,steps you need to go through when you,305169.0,307239.0
3,find yourself having to communicate with,307240.0,308918.0
3,someone who you have no language or,308919.0,311349.0
3,communication system in common with. And,311350.0,313029.0
3,I think that's why it's been so,313030.0,314619.0
3,appealing. And it's a really compelling,314620.0,315849.0
3,part of the story as well because it,315850.0,317859.0
3,means that they don't fall back on this kind of,317860.0,319569.0
3,deus ex machina universal translator or,319570.0,322809.0
3,interpreter or something like that.,322810.0,324499.0
3,Trying to communicate is the major,324500.0,326539.0
3,driving force behind the film. G: yeah and the,326540.0,328759.0
3,process of trying to figure out a,328760.0,330829.0
3,language when you have no language in,330830.0,331999.0
3,common with the people who are speaking,332000.0,333259.0
3,"it is a real thing, it's called monolingual",333260.0,335359.0
3,"elicitation. Ken Hale, who is a former",335360.0,337729.0
3,"professor at MIT, is the best known",337730.0,340099.0
3,person who's done that. There are,340100.0,341479.0
3,demonstrations for linguistic students,341480.0,343759.0
3,about doing this. So it's a real thing,343760.0,345709.0
3,that people have to do. I've seen a,345710.0,347209.0
3,monolingual fieldwork demonstration and,347210.0,349039.0
3,you generally start with very concrete,349040.0,350479.0
3,"objects. You pick up a stick, you pick up",350480.0,352369.0
3,"a rock, or you gesture to yourself and you say",352370.0,354949.0
3,"your own name. And this type of thing -- body parts, stuff that's",354950.0,358939.0
3,"around you, that you can point to. And you work on",358940.0,361309.0
3,the assumption that the other person,361310.0,362749.0
3,also wants to communicate and they also,362750.0,364369.0
3,understand that communication is a,364370.0,365899.0
3,thing and that words are a thing. And,365900.0,367759.0
3,you're just trying to convey your intent,367760.0,369168.0
3,that you want to try to learn their,369169.0,370159.0
3,language. And then you can start acting,370160.0,371749.0
3,stuff out like 'I drop the stick' or 'I'm,371750.0,373969.0
3,walking' 'I'm falling' you don't necessarily know,373970.0,376219.0
3,if they're giving you a word for 'walk' or,376220.0,378559.0
3,if they're giving you a word for 'go' or if they're,378560.0,380359.0
3,giving you a word for 'move'. So you have to figure,380360.0,382729.0
3,that out later. But you're at least getting,382730.0,383869.0
3,some sort of verb and you can see kind,383870.0,385279.0
3,"of what the verbs do and stuff like that. So, monolingual fieldwork is a real",385280.0,389119.0
3,thing that people do with humans and in,389120.0,391099.0
3,theory if we got in contact with aliens,391100.0,393349.0
3,that would be something we'd have to do.,393350.0,394639.0
3,L: yeah we're lucky that they are embodied,394640.0,397789.0
3,"aliens. Like, they're aliens that have bodies",397790.0,400459.0
3,and as far as we can tell those bodies,400460.0,402739.0
3,belong to separate entities because if,402740.0,404929.0
3,there was some kind of like hive-mind who,404930.0,407119.0
3,didn't realize that individual humans,407120.0,408679.0
3,were communicating with them separately.,408680.0,410029.0
3,"G: yeah or if, as is more likely, we're",410030.0,412189.0
3,making contact with them via radio waves,412190.0,414499.0
3,or pulses of light or something like,414500.0,416359.0
3,that and we didn't have bodies in common,416360.0,418519.0
3,"at all, that could be a lot more difficult.",418520.0,420439.0
3,L: yeah so really the fact that they turned,420440.0,422418.0
3,up in giant spaceships is very,422419.0,424189.0
3,convenient G: very convenient L: to doing,424190.0,426379.0
3,linguist-based fieldwork G:and that the,426380.0,428659.0
3,spaceship has a kind of like built-in,428660.0,430249.0
3,whiteboard thing. It's like they knew. L: yeah,430250.0,432259.0
3,"that was pretty cool. G: very helpful. Thanks, aliens,",432260.0,435409.0
3,good job! I think actually in the short,435410.0,437209.0
3,"story, they just sent in like a",437210.0,438799.0
3,television screen for the aliens. They,438800.0,440509.0
3,didn't actually have the aliens,440510.0,441409.0
3,"physically there. L: yeah, so some people may",441410.0,444349.0
3,"know this, but the film is based on a",444350.0,446269.0
3,short story about essentially the same,446270.0,448668.0
3,premise of aliens come to earth and we,448669.0,451219.0
3,have to learn to communicate with them.,451220.0,452629.0
3,But there's something really beautifully,452630.0,454699.0
3,mundane about the short story. So in the,454700.0,456799.0
3,short story,456800.0,458209.0
3,120 of these screens essentially appear,458210.0,461719.0
3,across the earth and pairs of aliens,461720.0,464149.0
3,turn up to them and work with humans to,464150.0,466339.0
3,kind of communicate. And instead of,466340.0,468649.0
3,people being in a mass hysteria,468650.0,470719.0
3,"about it, which is a kind of driving",470720.0,472758.0
3,"tension in the film, everyone's actually",472759.0,474918.0
3,"just pretty chill. Like, they go in, they",474919.0,476749.0
3,"worked with the aliens, and then they go",476750.0,478129.0
3,"home at the end of the day. G:Yeah, it's a lot calmer there's",478130.0,480348.0
3,less of this like tension music. So the,480349.0,481848.0
3,short story is called The Story of Your Life and it's by Ted Chiang. It was published quite,481849.0,485809.0
3,a long time ago. The creators of this,485810.0,487159.0
3,film spent a while trying to figure out,487160.0,488508.0
3,how to get it made because it's not a,488509.0,490219.0
3,very Hollywood story. and so they did have,490220.0,491929.0
3,to up the tension which I think works,491930.0,493249.0
3,well in the movie context where you,493250.0,495198.0
3,have people wondering if there's going to be riots,495199.0,497659.0
3,in the streets and you know people,497660.0,499219.0
3,complaining about the government and,499220.0,500749.0
3,dramatic news reports and all,500750.0,502249.0
3,this stuff. But at the same time I think,502250.0,504348.0
3,that there's something very intimate about,504349.0,506629.0
3,the short story.,506630.0,507529.0
3,So the movie itself the director,507530.0,510019.0
3,was Denis Villeneuve who is a,510020.0,512629.0
3,Montreal-based director he's from,512630.0,515088.0
3,"Montreal, his family's here. That's why",515089.0,516379.0
3,they filmed it in Montreal,516380.0,517549.0
3,"L: Ah, I thought it was just because of that",517550.0,519379.0
3,thing where Canada's cheap for Hollywood,519380.0,521478.0
3,to shoot in G: probably that too i'm sure,521479.0,523429.0
3,the tax breaks did help but i think the,523430.0,525588.0
3,reason why montreal specifically with,525589.0,527148.0
3,because yeah he has family here. So,527149.0,530179.0
3,they were filming in Montreal i think some,530180.0,531648.0
3,of these scenes at the university were,531649.0,533179.0
3,filmed at Concordia. And when they filmed it,533180.0,536028.0
3,in the summer of 2015 they got in touch,536029.0,538159.0
3,with some professors at McGill,538160.0,539719.0
3,University. I know they got in touch with,539720.0,541398.0
3,"several different professors. So, Jessica",541399.0,543199.0
3,"Coon ,who was the one that was my advisor,",543200.0,545028.0
3,was the primary linguistics consultant for,545029.0,547099.0
3,"the film because she has done fieldwork,",547100.0,549109.0
3,she's kind of a similar age demographic,549110.0,551539.0
3,to Amy Adams. So if you're going to,551540.0,552828.0
3,model stuff off her I guess it makes sense.,552829.0,556009.0
3,Jessica said they asked her what kind of,556010.0,558078.0
3,bag she carries so that they could give,558079.0,559819.0
3,Amy Adams a similar laptop bag.,559820.0,562069.0
3,And then they also worked with Morgan Sonderegger who's also a prof at McGill on,562070.0,566028.0
3,some of the audiovisual stuff. So I,566029.0,568759.0
3,think he's the one that's responsible,568760.0,569689.0
3,for them using Praat on the computer,569690.0,572689.0
3,screens. L: Apparently it's not real,572690.0,574849.0
3,Praat it's like fake Praat.,574850.0,576889.0
3,So these are the kind of details that,576890.0,578299.0
3,linguists get really excited about in,578300.0,580039.0
3,this film. But when you pan over the,580040.0,581389.0
3,computer screens that different analysts,581390.0,583729.0
3,"are using in dealing with these aliens, a",583730.0,585889.0
3,lot of the software looks really,585890.0,586909.0
3,familiar. And one of the pieces of,586910.0,588708.0
3,software that linguists use to analyze,588709.0,590389.0
3,"spectrograms,",590390.0,591389.0
3,which is a kind of visualization of,591390.0,593279.0
3,"sound patterns, is a program called",593280.0,595199.0
3,Praat. It's adorable it was,595200.0,597149.0
3,written in the eighties or nineties and,597150.0,598769.0
3,it still looks like it today. G:it's a pretty,598770.0,600779.0
3,old-school looking program but it works great,600780.0,602339.0
3,L: every generation who was trained on,602340.0,605159.0
3,computers to do phonetic analysis was,605160.0,607619.0
3,trained with Praat.,607620.0,608669.0
3,we have warm and fuzzy feelings towards,608670.0,610289.0
3,it so seeing something that looks very,610290.0,611729.0
3,much like that piece of software on,611730.0,613589.0
3,screen was nerd points plus. G: yeah so that,613590.0,616529.0
3,was good. So i think he's responsible for,616530.0,617699.0
3,that. And then when they were figuring,617700.0,619799.0
3,out the office that Amy Adams's,619800.0,622709.0
3,character would have in the movie they,622710.0,624749.0
3,wanted to look at real linguistics,624750.0,626969.0
3,offices and the story goes that they,626970.0,629039.0
3,went to Jessica's office and Jessica,629040.0,630389.0
3,showed them around her office and they,630390.0,631679.0
3,made a note that she had like a tea,631680.0,633239.0
3,"kettle and a cup of tea, so they were like",633240.0,634739.0
3,"she can have tea, we can have tea for this",634740.0,635879.0
3,prof. which I think is very authentic - a lot of linguists have tea in,635880.0,639059.0
3,their offices. But they also wanted an,639060.0,641099.0
3,office that had like more stuff in it. So,641100.0,644069.0
3,Jessica took them upstairs to Lisa Travis's,644070.0,646889.0
3,office and they looked around Lisa's,646890.0,648359.0
3,office and they also took inspiration,648360.0,650099.0
3,from that office. Lisa has been a,650100.0,652649.0
3,prof for longer and she has more books,652650.0,654779.0
3,around and she has more papers and more,654780.0,657749.0
3,stuff in her office. So they rented,657750.0,661079.0
3,some books from Jessica but they also,661080.0,662849.0
3,rented some books from Lisa because,662850.0,664079.0
3,Jessica didn't have enough books. L: i mean there,664080.0,666209.0
3,are a lot of books in that office. G: They,666210.0,668249.0
3,rented the books by the foot. L: By the foot!,668250.0,670799.0
3,"G: Yeah, they rented the books by the foot and they really",670800.0,672809.0
3,wanted to rent the blue and cream books,672810.0,675359.0
3,that Lisa had. L: it was impressively,675360.0,677669.0
3,uncluttered for an academic office G: yeah,677670.0,679709.0
3,i think they kind of struck a medium,679710.0,681299.0
3,between Jessica's office and Lisa's office.,681300.0,683009.0
3,"Because Jessica's office is also very clean, very neat and uncluttered.",683010.0,684989.0
3,And so I think they kind of struck a medium,684990.0,687509.0
3,between there. But the way the shelves are,687510.0,689279.0
3,formed looks a lot like McGill shelves L: right,689280.0,692219.0
3,so you feel very homely when you see,692220.0,694079.0
3,that scene. G: yeah!,694080.0,695009.0
3,Ben Zimmer did a post on Language Log,695010.0,696449.0
3,talking to Lisa and Jessica and Morgan about,696450.0,699389.0
3,the office design decisions so we can,699390.0,701849.0
3,link to that in the description as well.,701850.0,703439.0
3,L: another thing that they put a lot of,703440.0,705029.0
3,effort into was designing the language,705030.0,707519.0
3,Heptapod B which is the beautiful,707520.0,709589.0
3,circular writing system.,709590.0,711059.0
3,Someone said it looks like a coffee stain.,711060.0,712469.0
3,from a mug and I haven't,712470.0,714449.0
3,really been able to get that image out of my,714450.0,715889.0
3,head but that logographic writing system,715890.0,718559.0
3,is actually a,718560.0,720149.0
3,it is a functional constructed script as,720150.0,722519.0
3,far as i'm aware. G: it has pieces to it. Like,722520.0,724349.0
3,it has different specific parts that,724350.0,725699.0
3,mean specific things and this was one of,725700.0,727349.0
3,the other things that they got Jessica,727350.0,728429.0
3,Coon to do. They sent her a bunch of,728430.0,730949.0
3,printouts of this script and they said,730950.0,732959.0
3,"'Go, analyze it! We're not gonna tell you",732960.0,734819.0
3,anything.' And so she kind of marked it up,734820.0,737309.0
3,with what she thought different stuff,737310.0,739109.0
3,"might be doing, to try to figure out like",739110.0,741029.0
3,what each part meant without any knowledge of,741030.0,742979.0
3,what it was doing and they used that as,742980.0,744719.0
3,some of the -- I dunno if they used the exact things,744720.0,746759.0
3,that she had marked off herself or if they,746760.0,748109.0
3,just used that as a basis for some of,748110.0,749789.0
3,the annotations that Louise Banks as the,749790.0,751799.0
3,linguist character would do in the,751800.0,752909.0
3,film. L: i read somewhere the guy who,752910.0,754829.0
3,designed the script his son got like,754830.0,757229.0
3,really into it and it was his son who,757230.0,758909.0
3,designed the analysis program that goes,758910.0,761429.0
3,through and looks at the points and does,761430.0,763289.0
3,science on it. G: so there were two things right,763290.0,764999.0
3,there was the like artistic designer who,765000.0,766829.0
3,designed the script and then there were,766830.0,768089.0
3,the analyst people who did the physics,768090.0,770279.0
3,"and computer programs. So, i don't",770280.0,772649.0
3,remember the name of the script designer,772650.0,774269.0
3,but I know it was like the production,774270.0,775619.0
3,designer's wife or something and they,775620.0,776759.0
3,keep referring to her as the wife and,776760.0,778739.0
3,not with her name which is annoying to,778740.0,780089.0
3,me. So I don't know her name but we'll try,780090.0,782039.0
3,to link to her. She's a graphic designer,782040.0,783299.0
3,who made the script and then it was Wolfram -- I think Stephen Wolfram and his son,783300.0,786959.0
3,who did the math and physics-y,786960.0,789239.0
3,side and they wrote an active,789240.0,791399.0
3,computer program to analyze bits of the,791400.0,793049.0
3,script and put it together.,793050.0,794339.0
3,L: yeah G: there's a moment in the film where,794340.0,796199.0
3,she's trying to make a sentence and she,796200.0,798029.0
3,picks the part that means human,798030.0,799949.0
3,and the part that means arrive or,799950.0,801989.0
3,"something. she picks, you know, a noun and a verb",801990.0,803579.0
3,and something else and she picks,803580.0,805499.0
3,these bits and says put these together,805500.0,807179.0
3,and it like smushes them together into a,807180.0,809459.0
3,round circular thing on the screen. Which,809460.0,811769.0
3,is a great computer program. I would,811770.0,813029.0
3,love to have this program to do,813030.0,813989.0
3,linguistic analysis with. L: yeah it looked really,813990.0,816059.0
3,pretty. I love that in 10,816060.0,818249.0
3,days of aliens arriving they can make,818250.0,820199.0
3,better linguistics software than we've,820200.0,821699.0
3,had in like 10 years G: and we're still,821700.0,824609.0
3,using praat. L: we're still using Praat. I'm,824610.0,826949.0
3,"going to link to Praat in the notes G: Oh yeah, please do",826950.0,828419.0
3,L: just because the logo is,828420.0,829859.0
3,amazing. Someone drew it in Paint like in,829860.0,832679.0
3,the nineties. G: I believe that. L: and it's just,832680.0,834089.0
3,stayed that way. It's pretty adorably,834090.0,836399.0
3,hideous. G: yeah so in the meantime the,836400.0,838379.0
3,military has this money to write a,838380.0,839759.0
3,whole computer program in ten days.,839760.0,841319.0
3,L: One thing we've not even,841320.0,844889.0
3,touched on yet is the cornerstone of the,844890.0,847589.0
3,emotional journey of the film which is,847590.0,850259.0
3,that in working with these aliens,850260.0,853019.0
3,and figuring out their language and,853020.0,854579.0
3,"learning to use it, it changes the way",854580.0,856619.0
3,Amy Adams's character perceives time.,856620.0,859319.0
3,Time stops being a linear construction,859320.0,861569.0
3,"for her. Really, if you got this far",861570.0,862949.0
3,through the podcast you deserve to have,862950.0,864359.0
3,that plot point spoiled if you haven't seen it,864360.0,866099.0
3,yet. G: it's also in the short story. So I,866100.0,868409.0
3,walked in already knowing it and I still,868410.0,870149.0
3,got a lot out of the movie. so at the beginning of,870150.0,871859.0
3,the film we see a short,871860.0,873659.0
3,montage of her with a child you know,873660.0,875579.0
3,having a baby and the child growing up and,875580.0,877589.0
3,then the child ultimately dying at quite,877590.0,879689.0
3,a young age i think around 11 of some,879690.0,881519.0
3,terrible illness. And so I think,881520.0,884129.0
3,people are supposed to assume that this,884130.0,885989.0
3,has already happened before the events,885990.0,888179.0
3,of the movie even start. Because we see,888180.0,889979.0
3,"her with a child, but we don't see each a father for",889980.0,891629.0
3,the child. So we just see her daughter. And,891630.0,893669.0
3,then as she starts decoding the alien,893670.0,896669.0
3,language she starts getting what we think are,896670.0,898799.0
3,flashbacks but in the end are actually,898800.0,900269.0
3,flash-forwards into her life with the,900270.0,902219.0
3,child. And at the end she makes the,902220.0,903839.0
3,"decision that, yes, she's gonna go",903840.0,905609.0
3,"ahead and get with this guy, even though",905610.0,907799.0
3,she knows that it's going to end up in,907800.0,909239.0
3,divorce and separation and then,909240.0,912269.0
3,ultimately the child dying. So she,912270.0,913739.0
3,decides that the good points of that are,913740.0,915689.0
3,worth the sad points. L: so that's something,915690.0,918029.0
3,in terms of the emotional journey,918030.0,920459.0
3,that is something quite different between the,920460.0,922019.0
3,film and the short story because in the,922020.0,924689.0
3,short story she says very clearly even,924690.0,927029.0
3,though I knew exactly what was going to happen,927030.0,929129.0
3,and how events were going to unfold,929130.0,931439.0
3,"I felt completely uncompelled to--- I mean,",931440.0,934289.0
3,I guess it's the same in the short story,934290.0,935909.0
3,and the film but in the short story it's,935910.0,938159.0
3,not made clear that she and her husband,938160.0,941579.0
3,get divorced because she tells him or he,941580.0,944069.0
3,figures out that she knows something,944070.0,945389.0
3,about the future.,945390.0,946169.0
3,it's just how events go. Sometimes,946170.0,948599.0
3,when films dabble in that kind of stuff,948600.0,951149.0
3,from a short story or a story you really,951150.0,953429.0
3,like you can feel a bit cheated but I,953430.0,955499.0
3,"thought it was done really well. G: Yeah, I think",955500.0,956789.0
3,mostly it was done very well. It turned,956790.0,958409.0
3,into a meditation on choice and free,958410.0,960449.0
3,will and whether moments of joy are worth,960450.0,962309.0
3,moments of suffering or if you had the,962310.0,963989.0
3,chance to change your fate would you?,963990.0,965849.0
3,L: yeah I know he has a name but I can,965850.0,968309.0
3,only think of him as Hawkeye so it's,968310.0,970889.0
3,Louise banks hooks up with Hawkeye. G: I think he's,970890.0,973199.0
3,technically Jeremy Renner but we can keep,973200.0,974489.0
3,calling him Hawkeye. L: ok good. G:and the character is,974490.0,976709.0
3,Ian. So Louise Banks hooks up with Ian.,976710.0,979379.0
3,Amy Adams with... L: Hawkeye. G: I was expecting,979380.0,983039.0
3,his character to be a lot more annoying,983040.0,984269.0
3,because they kind of set him up as like,984270.0,985379.0
3,this douchey scientist at the beginning,985380.0,986789.0
3,and then he just became a foil for her,986790.0,988289.0
3,to like say her ideas and I was fine,988290.0,989969.0
3,with that.,989970.0,990569.0
3,L: it's really nice for a guy to be the,990570.0,992789.0
3,ditzy eye candy,992790.0,994079.0
3,I'm completely okay with that G: I don't,994080.0,995969.0
3,really think of Jeremy Renner as eye candy,995970.0,997319.0
3,but it was really nice to,997320.0,999149.0
3,have a female character be just kind of,999150.0,1000469.0
3,compelling. it wasn't that she was like,1000470.0,1001609.0
3,sexualized she's just there being a,1001610.0,1003259.0
3,scientist.,1003260.0,1004279.0
3,Ok so there's this one bit which i think,1004280.0,1006169.0
3,is a big linguist quibble part of the,1006170.0,1008209.0
3,story where his character says to her,1008210.0,1010519.0
3,character 'You think of language like a,1010520.0,1012709.0
3,mathematician.' The thing that I found,1012710.0,1014239.0
3,very unrealistic is that she does not,1014240.0,1015709.0
3,"say, 'Um, yeah, obviously.'",1015710.0,1017659.0
3,L:yeah there are a few times we're you're just like,1017660.0,1019279.0
3,'If she was a real linguist she'd just be,1019280.0,1020689.0
3,"like 'Uh yes, of course, that is obviously",1020690.0,1023929.0
3,"what I do.' G: Like, 'Oh my god, seriously",1023930.0,1025609.0
3,this is literally what linguistics is.',1025610.0,1028189.0
3,But i get that she wasn't supposed to be,1028190.0,1030379.0
3,"like a smart mouthing, wisecracking person.",1030380.0,1032239.0
3,There's another moment in the film where,1032240.0,1034909.0
3,she uses this analogy of the kangaroo,1034910.0,1038389.0
3,story. So the military guy is saying,1038390.0,1041089.0
3,'Why do we need to learn learn basic verbs and nouns?,1041090.0,1042979.0
3,Why can't we just ask them why are they here?',1042980.0,1044899.0
3,"And she's like, 'Look, we have to build up",1044900.0,1046489.0
3,to that and we have to understand their,1046490.0,1048079.0
3,response. Because when Captain Cook was,1048080.0,1050599.0
3,arriving in Australia he asked one of,1050600.0,1052519.0
3,the Australians 'What is this?',1052520.0,1054199.0
3,and the person said 'kangaroo' which it turns out,1054200.0,1055849.0
3,just means 'i don't know'.' So what,1055850.0,1057559.0
3,I've heard is that this was a line in,1057560.0,1059749.0
3,the script that Jessica Coon looked at and,1059750.0,1061399.0
3,"she's like, 'This story is false' but the",1061400.0,1063169.0
3,"producers were like, 'Well, we still want to",1063170.0,1065269.0
3,have the story in because it makes this point really,1065270.0,1066889.0
3,well' And so what they did is they added,1066890.0,1068869.0
3,in a line where the military guy would,1068870.0,1071479.0
3,leave and then physicist guy would be,1071480.0,1073459.0
3,"like, 'Great story!' and she'd be like 'Yeah, it's false.'",1073460.0,1074959.0
3,That turned into kind of a laugh line,1074960.0,1076849.0
3,"for the audience. L: Actually, it annoyed me",1076850.0,1079009.0
3,"because the line was, 'It's probably not",1079010.0,1081139.0
3,true.' And the actual reality is it's,1081140.0,1083779.0
3,definitely not true.,1083780.0,1085009.0
3,It was a language that wasn't spoken near,1085010.0,1087169.0
3,Sydney. There's a long and now better,1087170.0,1089779.0
3,documented history. G: good.,1089780.0,1091369.0
3,Yeah so the original version of the,1091370.0,1092869.0
3,script had her play that story straight,1092870.0,1094339.0
3,as if it was true and then it's because of,1094340.0,1096799.0
3,Jessica as the linguist consultant because she,1096800.0,1098629.0
3,"was like, 'this story is false' that they",1098630.0,1100009.0
3,added in the second part.,1100010.0,1101359.0
3,L: excellent she did a good job. And of,1101360.0,1103309.0
3,course just as i was feeling good and,1103310.0,1105769.0
3,"smug that they got that right,",1105770.0,1107749.0
3,the military dude then turns around and,1107750.0,1110449.0
3,says all this bullshit about-- I,1110450.0,1112789.0
3,can't remember what the line was but I,1112790.0,1114349.0
3,was so angry at the time.' G: i think it was,1114350.0,1116509.0
3,like 'they got wiped out by a superior,1116510.0,1117949.0
3,race' or 'they nearly got wiped out by,1117950.0,1119689.0
3,a superior society',1119690.0,1120499.0
3,or something like that. And it's supposed to,1120500.0,1122479.0
3,be an analogy that maybe the aliens,1122480.0,1124789.0
3,are coming to wipe out humanity. but it,1124790.0,1126799.0
3,turns into saying that the colonizers,1126800.0,1129799.0
3,were superior for wiping out the,1129800.0,1131689.0
3,Australians. And thaaaaaaaat's not great,1131690.0,1135859.0
3,"L:yeah, did not sit very well with",1135860.0,1138019.0
3,me. So I did,1138020.0,1139819.0
3,talk about this on Twitter after I saw,1139820.0,1141889.0
3,"the film, and I've had a few people be like",1141890.0,1144109.0
3,'maybe they did that knowingly' or 'but the black guy said it',1144110.0,1148999.0
3,which was definitely not my favorite,1149000.0,1150199.0
3,suggestion for why it was ok.,1150200.0,1153049.0
3,Yeah I don't think they did it knowingly,1153050.0,1154759.0
3,and that was quite an annoying line to toe.,1154760.0,1158029.0
3,G: And i think you could make a similar,1158030.0,1159799.0
3,point without making a line that's quite,1159800.0,1161719.0
3,that bad,1161720.0,1162649.0
3,"L: yeah like, if she was a real linguist she",1162650.0,1164419.0
3,would definitely have gone to town on,1164420.0,1165859.0
3,"him for that. G: yeah, because real linguists",1165860.0,1168289.0
3,care about the well-being of,1168290.0,1169999.0
3,minority language communities and defend,1170000.0,1172339.0
3,them.,1172340.0,1172909.0
3,L: yeah. So the nonlinear time that Louise,1172910.0,1177199.0
3,"starts perceiving is, as we said, key to the",1177200.0,1180229.0
3,plot and the twist in the whole,1180230.0,1182449.0
3,film. And that idea in the film and in,1182450.0,1185269.0
3,the short story is inspired by something,1185270.0,1187429.0
3,that people have been talking about in,1187430.0,1189229.0
3,linguistics for quite a while now and,1189230.0,1191119.0
3,that's the theory of linguistic,1191120.0,1192469.0
3,relativity. G: and the reason that the alien,1192470.0,1195859.0
3,language causes her to perceive time,1195860.0,1197869.0
3,differently because it's written,1197870.0,1199069.0
3,nonlinearly. So the linguistic relativity,1199070.0,1201169.0
3,I think we agreed that it's a satisfying,1201170.0,1203119.0
3,"emotional journey, but from a technical legal",1203120.0,1204859.0
3,standpoint it just seems really really,1204860.0,1207259.0
3,unlikely that learning another language,1207260.0,1208789.0
3,is going to completely alter your sense,1208790.0,1210559.0
3,of what past and future is. But then,1210560.0,1212569.0
3,again this is a film about aliens.,1212570.0,1214669.0
3,L: yeah and who knows maybe there was some,1214670.0,1216139.0
3,weird special mind-altering gas in the,1216140.0,1218569.0
3,chamber and it wasn't really a,1218570.0,1220039.0
3,linguistic influence it turns out to be,1220040.0,1221599.0
3,some neurotoxin influence.,1221600.0,1223489.0
3,That's what I'm putting my money on. You,1223490.0,1225049.0
3,want to really reanalyze that,1225050.0,1226699.0
3,environment she was in. G: Maybe it was a,1226700.0,1228889.0
3,"neurotoxin. I mean, i think the film",1228890.0,1230929.0
3,is trying to set up the point that it's,1230930.0,1232939.0
3,"the language,because they talk about the",1232940.0,1234499.0
3,Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis and they talk,1234500.0,1236269.0
3,about this idea that language can affect,1236270.0,1237859.0
3,how you perceive the world. And i think,1237860.0,1239689.0
3,that's the point that the film is trying,1239690.0,1240799.0
3,to make. But i don't think we as an,1240800.0,1242539.0
3,audience have to believe that this is a,1242540.0,1244279.0
3,real thing that happens any more than we,1244280.0,1246319.0
3,believe in time travel paradoxes or heptapod,1246320.0,1250159.0
3,aliens existing in the first,1250160.0,1251419.0
3,place.,1251420.0,1252229.0
3,L:linguistic relativity,1252230.0,1254089.0
3,is an entire field of academic,1254090.0,1256099.0
3,inquiry and I don't want to reduce it to,1256100.0,1258168.0
3,a pithy line. My feeling with it is that the,1258169.0,1260538.0
3,effects that we've seen that exists to,1260539.0,1262278.0
3,suggest linguistic relativity is a thing,1262279.0,1264199.0
3,are usually deeply embedded in culture and,1264200.0,1267439.0
3,language acquisition and other factors,1267440.0,1268999.0
3,that are hard to tease apart. And they,1269000.0,1271308.0
3,often tend to be effects that can be,1271309.0,1274099.0
3,negated through a small amount of metalinguistic,1274100.0,1277939.0
3,awareness and a bit of,1277940.0,1279349.0
3,training in a certain paradigm to kind,1279350.0,1281538.0
3,of counteract any effect. G: and it can be quite subtle. One,1281539.0,1283788.0
3,example of something that has been shown,1283789.0,1285168.0
3,for weak versions of linguistic relativity,1285169.0,1287569.0
3,is that if your language says that two,1287570.0,1290778.0
3,particular shades are part of the same,1290779.0,1292548.0
3,"color, you'll tend to treat them similarly",1292549.0,1294528.0
3,whereas if it says that they're part of,1294529.0,1296239.0
3,different colors then you'll treat them,1296240.0,1297528.0
3,differently. So if your language has,1297529.0,1299359.0

3,"blue. Which English doesn't, but Russian",1301039.0,1302839.0
3,"does and Italian does, you'll tend to",1302840.0,1304609.0
3,treat those two colors as different -- the,1304610.0,1306109.0
3,way English-speakers treat pink and red,1306110.0,1308119.0
3,as different colors.,1308120.0,1309859.0
3,I don't think it means that we're,1309860.0,1310819.0
3,physically incapable of perceiving the,1310820.0,1312439.0
3,"difference between different reds,",1312440.0,1313639.0
3,because obviously we do this all the,1313640.0,1315229.0
3,time. It's just that it kind of facilitates,1315230.0,1317389.0
3,"our thinking in a particular direction,",1317390.0,1318769.0
3,because we're used to associating one,1318770.0,1322189.0
3,group of things versus another group of things.,1322190.0,1323749.0
3,So the linguistic relativity effects,1323750.0,1326479.0
3,that you get tend to be very small and,1326480.0,1328099.0
3,tend to be in the direction of other,1328100.0,1330619.0
3,types of cultural associations and,1330620.0,1332239.0
3,cultural priming. So there's an analogy,1332240.0,1334038.0
3,"that John McWhorter uses, which is if you",1334039.0,1336469.0
3,feel more serious in a tuxedo than you,1336470.0,1338959.0
3,"feel in a clown suit, that doesn't mean",1338960.0,1341538.0
3,that the clown suit is affecting your,1341539.0,1343489.0
3,thoughts.,1343490.0,1344359.0
3,It means you have these associations,1344360.0,1345499.0
3,with what wearing a red nose and big,1345500.0,1348349.0
3,shoes and like a multicolored,1348350.0,1350509.0
3,"wig is, that are different from your",1350510.0,1352639.0
3,associations with wearing a tuxedo.,1352640.0,1355009.0
3,L: yeah it's a good way to put it. G: one thing,1355010.0,1357079.0
3,that i found interesting about the,1357080.0,1358339.0
3,interviews with the movie,1358340.0,1359719.0
3,creators is that they were really proud of,1359720.0,1360798.0
3,themselves for having gotten the words,1360799.0,1361999.0
3,'nonlinear orthography' into a hollywood,1362000.0,1363739.0
3,movie because that's kind of technical. But,1363740.0,1365959.0
3,"this idea is that the alien language, at",1365960.0,1367969.0
3,"least the written one, is produced in",1367970.0,1369619.0
3,such a way that you have to know what,1369620.0,1370939.0
3,"the whole sentences is, as it's kind of",1370940.0,1372678.0
3,spurting out of your inkblots,1372679.0,1374509.0
3,sort of way. So because the aliens,1374510.0,1377389.0
3,are producing language non-linearly,1377390.0,1379219.0
3,they're also thinking non-linearly about,1379220.0,1381199.0
3,the whole world. And i don't know if i,1381200.0,1382969.0
3,buy this connection. I think that was one,1382970.0,1385069.0
3,of the weak points to me that the alien,1385070.0,1387319.0
3,language,1387320.0,1387629.0
3,would truly be nonlinear because,1387630.0,1389279.0
3,it just looks to me like it's written in,1389280.0,1390689.0
3,a circle but it still has like parts to,1390690.0,1392669.0
3,it.,1392670.0,1393209.0
3,L: yeah I definitely had more weavy,1393210.0,1395729.0
3,visualization when i read the short,1395730.0,1397349.0
3,story it's more about the kind of,1397350.0,1399179.0
3,meshing together of different bits. G: in,1399180.0,1401249.0
3,the short story i got the idea that--- so,1401250.0,1403319.0
3,let's say you have a sentence in,1403320.0,1405749.0
3,heptapod that's like 'I see the dog' so,1405750.0,1409919.0
3,"you know three words, ostensibly. And",1409920.0,1413099.0
3,that the part that meant 'dog' might exist,1413100.0,1415679.0
3,in like five different spots.,1415680.0,1417299.0
3,L: yeah G:and the part that meant 'see' might exist,1417300.0,1419489.0
3,in five different spots so that it,1419490.0,1420869.0
3,would be kind of distributed L: yeah weavy,1420870.0,1423089.0
3,Partly this is the case because it,1423090.0,1425009.0
3,would be truly difficult for humans to,1425010.0,1426599.0
3,come up with a very very very nonlinear,1426600.0,1429539.0
3,language and so we end up just doing the linear,1429540.0,1431999.0
3,language but putting it in a circle. L: if people,1432000.0,1434729.0
3,liked this film,1434730.0,1435899.0
3,what else could they see or read to tickle their linguist interest or their,1435900.0,1441959.0
3,linguistics sci fi interest. G: I think my top recommendation for people,1441960.0,1445469.0
3,who liked Arrival would be Embassytown,1445470.0,1447179.0
3,and this is a book by China Mieville -- I dunno,1447180.0,1450179.0
3,how you pronounce that person's name,1450180.0,1451499.0
3,actually. L: I say China Mieville G: I don't,1451500.0,1454079.0
3,know how to pronounce French,1454080.0,1455759.0
3,words in English I just speak too much,1455760.0,1458009.0
3,"French. So this is a book, it's sci-fi-ish, it's set on",1458010.0,1462029.0
3,a different planet. There are characters,1462030.0,1463979.0
3,who are responsible for figuring out the,1463980.0,1465299.0
3,language and stuff. It does have this,1465300.0,1466619.0
3,like alien language plus thought thing,1466620.0,1468719.0
3,which is like a fun,1468720.0,1470459.0
3,sci fi thought experiment the same way,1470460.0,1472409.0
3,that faster-than-light travel is a fun sci-fi,1472410.0,1474149.0
3,thought experiment. L: sci fi that plays,1474150.0,1477209.0
3,around with linguistics tends to come,1477210.0,1478649.0
3,back to linguistic relativity just,1478650.0,1480209.0
3,because it is a really compelling thing,1480210.0,1482369.0
3,to play around with it. So Babel 17 is a,1482370.0,1484739.0
3,book by Samuel Delaney that kind of also,1484740.0,1487199.0
3,plays around with this trope of learning,1487200.0,1489809.0
3,another language liberates your brain,1489810.0,1492119.0
3,from the constraints of these boring and,1492120.0,1494609.0
3,linear human languages. But in a much,1494610.0,1497099.0
3,more classically sci-fi kind of way. Like,1497100.0,1500549.0
3,Snow Crash is also quite similar.,1500550.0,1502619.0
3,Snow Crash is definitely Neal,1502620.0,1504539.0
3,Stephenson and that's more of the neuro,1504540.0,1506609.0
3,linguistic programming. Susette Haden,1506610.0,1508499.0
3,Elgin's Native Tongue is another,1508500.0,1511469.0
3,book that has linguistic relativity as a,1511470.0,1514169.0
3,central theme but also looks at this,1514170.0,1516629.0
3,kind of through language and gender and,1516630.0,1519179.0
3,she created a,1519180.0,1520309.0
3,constructured language around which the,1520310.0,1521779.0
3,plot in her book is based and you can,1521780.0,1523849.0
3,learn that language independent of,1523850.0,1525619.0
3,reading the book and the book is kind of,1525620.0,1527119.0
3,the world in which the languages is used,1527120.0,1529099.0
3,and used as a tool to change the way,1529100.0,1530899.0
3,people think. So that's another possible,1530900.0,1533029.0
3,"read. Otherwise, just reading the original",1533030.0,1535069.0
3,short story by Ted Chiang The Story of Your,1535070.0,1537409.0
3,"Life that Arrival is based on. G: Yeah, I would",1537410.0,1538969.0
3,definitely recommend the short story.,1538970.0,1540049.0
3,L: give a much more nuanced view of the,1540050.0,1542929.0
3,kind of mundane realities of field work,1542930.0,1544999.0
3,rather than the high drama of the film.,1545000.0,1547039.0
3,G: it's less dramatic. it has more fieldwork,1547040.0,1548659.0
3,and more physics in it. L: there are very,1548660.0,1550699.0
3,"few sci-fi films where you're like, 'Wow, I'm",1550700.0,1552739.0

3,a better run than the physics.',1554330.0,1555649.0
3,"G:Yeah, yeah! It was refreshing to see more",1555650.0,1558529.0
3,linguistics than physics in the film. I've,1558530.0,1560569.0
3,heard that physicists are also tolerably,1560570.0,1562219.0
3,pleased about it because the physicist,1562220.0,1563989.0
3,nowhere wears a white coat . L: RIght G: and,1563990.0,1566809.0

3,"science, i think -- it's a new YouTube",1576770.0,1578119.0

3,bunch of different creators including,1580160.0,1581479.0
3,Jessica Coon and Amy Adams and the real,1581480.0,1584059.0
3,physicists in this and so they talked,1584060.0,1586099.0
3,about physics representation as well. But,1586100.0,1588019.0
3,I think one of the things that's really,1588020.0,1589279.0
3,exciting for linguists about this film is,1589280.0,1591829.0
3,that there have been language-related,1591830.0,1594319.0
3,short stories and novels that play with,1594320.0,1597289.0
3,linguistics ideas. But if you look at the,1597290.0,1599929.0
3,pantheon of linguistic cinema,1599930.0,1602449.0
3,"I mean, what is there Lauren, there's like My",1602450.0,1604279.0
3,Fair Lady and Star Trek. L: That's about it.,1604280.0,1606589.0
3,G: So in My Fair Lady you have Henry,1606590.0,1608809.0
3,Higgins who is phonologist he,1608810.0,1611179.0
3,"does analyze different dialects, he can",1611180.0,1613069.0
3,tell where someone's from based on how,1613070.0,1614719.0
3,"they talk, which is moderately realistic.",1614720.0,1616489.0
3,But he's also kind of a jerk. L: he is very,1616490.0,1619009.0
3,a jerk. The whole thing is deeply,1619010.0,1620689.0
3,uncomfortable about class and power and,1620690.0,1623209.0
3,"gender. G: yeah, he's really pretentious",1623210.0,1625699.0
3,and snobbish about the 'right' way of,1625700.0,1627589.0
3,speaking English and training the flower,1627590.0,1629659.0
3,girl Eliza Doolittle into speaking,1629660.0,1631519.0

3,He's also a misogynist. He's not a very,1634790.0,1636409.0
3,pleasant guy! And so having that be the,1636410.0,1638539.0
3,linguist that's the best-known movie linguist,1638540.0,1641359.0
3,"is you know, Amy Adams's character Louise",1641360.0,1643489.0

3,your geekiest thought about the film? G: I'm gonna let,1647750.0,1649759.0
3,you go first.,1649760.0,1650629.0
3,L: from an interactional and cognitive,1650630.0,1652939.0
3,"perspective, by far the weirdest thing",1652940.0,1655129.0
3,"about the aliens, the heptapods, is that",1655130.0,1657889.0
3,they didn't point. They had seven bloody,1657890.0,1660109.0
3,"hands! Tentacle, finger things. The closest",1660110.0,1662869.0
3,you get it when they tap on the glass to,1662870.0,1664519.0
3,let her know that the bomb is about to,1664520.0,1666049.0
3,go off and then they splat on the glass but,1666050.0,1667759.0
3,"there's no pointing. You know, we don't",1667760.0,1669079.0
3,have many things we feel comfortable,1669080.0,1670459.0
3,saying are like universal hallmarks of,1670460.0,1673039.0
3,human communication but we've yet to,1673040.0,1675379.0
3,find a human society where people don't,1675380.0,1676969.0
3,point or understand pointing. It may vary,1676970.0,1679189.0
3,between cultures in terms of frequency,1679190.0,1680539.0
3,and whether people use certain fingers,1680540.0,1682669.0
3,all their lips or whatever. But pointing,1682670.0,1684709.0
3,and being able to perceive what a point means,1684710.0,1687079.0
3,seems to be a fundamental part of human,1687080.0,1688819.0
3,cognition -- and can be used by a variety,1688820.0,1690349.0
3,of other animals. It's one of the ways,1690350.0,1692269.0
3,that domesticated dogs are different,1692270.0,1693949.0
3,"from wolves apparently, is that dogs are",1693950.0,1695719.0
3,"much better at following pointing. G: Ok, so",1695720.0,1697849.0
3,you think if we were to meet an,1697850.0,1698959.0
3,intelligent species it would have to,1698960.0,1700789.0
3,"understand pointing L: no, I just think",1700790.0,1703069.0
3,it would have made those interactions,1703070.0,1704719.0
3,that we didn't see because there were,1704720.0,1706159.0
3,some nice montages-- trying to figure out,1706160.0,1708199.0
3,exactly what things were you know,1708200.0,1710539.0
3,Louise and Ian point at themselves and,1710540.0,1712699.0
3,"they're like 'Louise, I'm Louise' but the",1712700.0,1714859.0
3,the creatures don't point at themselves.,1714860.0,1716929.0
3,G: yeah that's true L: so it's not clear if,1716930.0,1719389.0
3,they understand pointing or if they,1719390.0,1721579.0
3,don't understand pointing and they,1721580.0,1722869.0
3,figured it out some other way. But yeah,1722870.0,1724609.0
3,that was definitely my hmmm moment.,1724610.0,1727069.0
3,G: I think my geekiest thing was wondering why...,1727070.0,1729319.0
3,So we do see later in the film there's this,1729320.0,1732109.0
3,kind of time travel paradox.,1732110.0,1733849.0
3,Not quite time travel but like future flash-forward,1733850.0,1736219.0
3,paradox where she learns information in,1736220.0,1737989.0
3,the future that she needs in the past.,1737990.0,1739729.0
3,L:yeah G:so in that case if the heptapods,1739730.0,1742309.0
3,"know that in 3,000 years they're gonna",1742310.0,1744409.0
3,"need the assistance of humanity, then",1744410.0,1745969.0
3,presumably they already actually,1745970.0,1747529.0
3,understand human language. At least some,1747530.0,1750829.0
3,parts of human language or some of the,1750830.0,1753289.0
3,"human languages, maybe not English. But",1753290.0,1755029.0
3,like they're walking in and it's not a,1755030.0,1757009.0
3,monolingual fieldwork situation for them,1757010.0,1758779.0
3,it's only a monolingual fieldwork situation,1758780.0,1760639.0
3,for the human. L: Well maybe it would have,1760640.0,1762859.0
3,been utterly impossible if they didn't have,1762860.0,1764989.0
3,"that. G: yeah, so maybe this is what",1764990.0,1767329.0
3,made it possible right? When Louise,1767330.0,1768889.0
3,says 'humans' and it turns out,1768890.0,1771499.0
3,they give her a logogram that means 'human',1771500.0,1774259.0
3,they can only do that because they,1774260.0,1775699.0
3,actually do understand what she says. So,1775700.0,1777439.0
3,this is what makes the the fast montage,1777440.0,1779659.0
3,of 10 days actually realistic. Because if,1779660.0,1781879.0
3,you were an actual fieldworker doing,1781880.0,1784069.0
3,this with no language in common you'd have,1784070.0,1785539.0
3,a bunch of false starts.,1785540.0,1786469.0
3,Where you'd to assume they were saying 'human',1786470.0,1787999.0
3,but they were actually saying their word,1788000.0,1789079.0
3,that meant 'person' or something like that.,1789080.0,1790279.0
3,Or maybe they don't make a distinction,1790280.0,1791658.0
3,between 'human' and 'person' maybe their words for those are,1791659.0,1793129.0
3,the same. There's a bunch of,1793130.0,1794209.0
3,different potential ambiguities that you,1794210.0,1795678.0
3,could have.,1795679.0,1796249.0
3,So maybe this is what makes the 10-day,1796250.0,1797869.0
3,fieldwork situation possible. L: but you,1797870.0,1800119.0
3,just think that if they are able to,1800120.0,1801529.0
3,perceive time like that then why not just turn up,1801530.0,1803599.0
3,with a phrasebook ready to go? G:yeah! like,1803600.0,1805908.0
3,"why not show up with a dictionary? Like,",1805909.0,1807408.0
3,"'hey, here guys, we made you some flashcards!'",1807409.0,1809178.0
3,Or 'we're just gonna talk English like the,1809179.0,1811158.0
3,aliens in Star Trek.' The reason that I,1811159.0,1813469.0
3,came to after thinking about this for a,1813470.0,1815599.0
3,while was that maybe what they wanted,1815600.0,1818149.0
3,was-- they didn't just want to be able to,1818150.0,1820219.0
3,"talk to humanity, they wanted to be able",1820220.0,1821779.0
3,"to influence. First of all, they needed",1821780.0,1823579.0
3,to be able to teach humans their language,1823580.0,1825408.0
3,and you make a better case for learning,1825409.0,1826879.0
3,the language oif it seems like the aliens,1826880.0,1828259.0
3,can't speak yours. Because the point is,1828260.0,1830058.0
3,they wanted to be able to make the humans,1830059.0,1831499.0
3,see the future as well and so on and so,1831500.0,1833089.0
3,"forth. And secondly, that they wanted to",1833090.0,1835999.0
3,screen for a very particular type of,1836000.0,1837439.0
3,person to be their primary contact and,1837440.0,1839449.0
3,they wanted to screen for a,1839450.0,1841279.0
3,linguist or at least someone who cares,1841280.0,1844009.0
3,about communication and can figure out,1844010.0,1845989.0
3,how to do this sort of monolingual,1845990.0,1847158.0
3,fieldwork elicitation and isn't just,1847159.0,1849829.0
3,a military person who's going to,1849830.0,1851178.0
3,run in there with guns ablaze.,1851179.0,1852558.0
3,So they wanted to have a more meditative,1852559.0,1854058.0
3,experience with the humans where they,1854059.0,1856158.0
3,they were able to to talk back and forth,1856159.0,1858019.0
3,more. That was the conclusion I ultimately,1858020.0,1859609.0
3,came to but it did make me wonder.,1859610.0,1865099.0

4,Society of America annual,105369.0,107259.0
4,conference and as part of that the,107260.0,109599.0
4,American dialect society run their,109600.0,112449.0
4,annual Word of the Year vote and,112450.0,115809.0
4,they have it at the start of january so,115810.0,118029.0
4,it definitely encompasses all of the,118030.0,120039.0
4,possible 2016 word time and it's a,120040.0,126069.0
4,big vote and you have been to the,126070.0,128678.0
4,last few and you were there for this one,128679.0,130538.0
4,this year right G: that is correct so we,130539.0,133539.0
4,were in a big ballroom in the Marriott in,133540.0,137349.0
4,"Austin, Texas where the whole conference",137350.0,140439.0
4,"is being held you can picture, I'm trying",140440.0,142509.0
4,"to describe this for you, can picture a",142510.0,144488.0
4,big conference ballroom a couple hundred,144489.0,146799.0
4,"people in it I didn't do a count, there",146800.0,148749.0
4,were a lot of them they finally got a,148750.0,151119.0
4,L: there was standing-room-only though,151120.0,153009.0
4,from the pictures on Twitter G: it was standing,153010.0,154509.0
4,"room only, big, packed conference room",154510.0,157479.0
4,I don't know at least at least 200,157480.0,158799.0
4,"probably more like for four, 500 people in",158800.0,161679.0
4,this ballroom and what we do is,161680.0,164768.0
4,on thursday we nominate for a bunch of,164769.0,166779.0
4,different categories for words of the year,166780.0,168578.0
4,and then on the Friday night we vote for,168579.0,171819.0
4,those categories there are short 30,171820.0,173559.0
4,second speeches from the floor in,173560.0,175359.0
4,support or against particular words in,175360.0,177249.0
4,those categories or to nominate a new,177250.0,178629.0
4,"thing, and then the same day we take",178630.0,181479.0
4,nominations and vote for the actual final,181480.0,184929.0
4,overall word of the year. Sometimes that,184930.0,186458.0
4,percolates up from the other category,186459.0,187749.0
4,"sometimes it's a new candidate, depends on",187750.0,189699.0
4,the year L: so it's all kind of a,189700.0,191439.0
4,combination of like structure and,191440.0,194078.0
4,tradition and kind of freeform chaotic,194079.0,197738.0
4,fun G: it's a lot of fun it's got a,197739.0,199839.0
4,certain structure to it we generally we,199840.0,201458.0
4,always have a limited amount of time,201459.0,202569.0
4,because that's just how conferences work,202570.0,204578.0
4,and so in the past all the years that I've,204579.0,206349.0
4,"been at its chaired by Ben Zimmer, who stands",206350.0,209139.0
4,in front of the mic and tries to keep us,209140.0,210759.0
4,moving along and and creates votes and,210760.0,212798.0
4,then he has a bunch of vote talliers.,212799.0,215319.0
4,So voting is by show of hands and there's,215320.0,217328.0
4,a vote tallier for each kind of section of,217329.0,218828.0
4,people who walk down the rows and,218829.0,221679.0
4,counts the people in their sections. So they,221680.0,223719.0
4,"report back to Ben, you can just watch all",223720.0,225548.0
4,"this happen, they report back to Ben",225549.0,227199.0
4,and then they put up the,227200.0,228189.0
4,numbers and then you have Grant Barrett,228190.0,230078.0
4,on the slides and so he writes down,230079.0,233559.0
4,those numbers and you can see him,233560.0,234789.0
4,"project it up there, he's generally in like",234790.0,236138.0
4,a word document,236139.0,236959.0
4,projected up onto the screen and so he,236960.0,238939.0
4,takes down those notes and also makes,238940.0,240769.0
4,whatever snarky comments come into his,240770.0,242539.0
4,head when he feels like it on the slides,242540.0,244999.0
4,which is fairly often so that's a lot of,245000.0,246319.0
4,fun L: so it's like a meta commentary,246320.0,247819.0
4,happening on the slides and then there's a,247820.0,249529.0
4,whole other kind of dialogue happening,249530.0,251479.0
4,on Twitter so for those of us that don't make it to,251480.0,253999.0
4,LSA every year hanging out on the WOTY16,254000.0,258589.0
4,hashtag which we'll put a link to in,258590.0,260929.0
4,the show notes because there was lots of,260930.0,262309.0
4,great tweeting happening around it and it,262310.0,264229.0
4,meant that even for those who weren't there,264230.0,266479.0
4,we got to feel like we we're kind of,266480.0,267799.0
4,participating,267800.0,268759.0
4,G: yeah so there's also the hashtag which,268760.0,270829.0
4,is always confusing for people because,270830.0,272149.0
4,it's WOTY16 because the sixteen,272150.0,275389.0
4,"refers 2016 the previous year, whereas",275390.0,277729.0
4,the LSA's hashtag is LSA2016 because that's LSA,277730.0,280849.0
4,happening in the current year L: LSA2017?,280850.0,282289.0
4,"G: 17! See even I got this wrong, because it's",282290.0,288409.0
4,"whatever, what year are we in!?",288410.0,289789.0
4,So there's those parallel,289790.0,292039.0
4,"conversations happening in the hashtags,",292040.0,293509.0
4,there's also conversations in the WOTY16,293510.0,295879.0
4,hashtag up to a month or two,295880.0,297979.0
4,before because bloggers will start,297980.0,299839.0
4,proposing their candidates for words of,299840.0,301669.0
4,the year making their blog post with,301670.0,302989.0
4,"recommendations, people in general just",302990.0,305089.0
4,be posting in the hashtag saying this is,305090.0,306679.0
4,"what I think would be a good thing, people",306680.0,307939.0
4,who can't make it but normally come will,307940.0,310219.0
4,be nominating stuff and sometimes people,310220.0,312109.0
4,get picked up by people to say,312110.0,313819.0
4,there's a buzz around this and I'm going,313820.0,315199.0
4,to nominate it,315200.0,316099.0
4,so there's kind of this advanced and,316100.0,317359.0
4,parallel conversations that happens on,317360.0,319459.0
4,the hashtag as well L: I put my nominations,319460.0,322339.0
4,on the hashtag a couple of weeks before,322340.0,324379.0
4,the event which was really fun because,324380.0,325789.0
4,then I felt vaguely invested in the,325790.0,327649.0
4,discussion G: yeah last year I wrote an,327650.0,329299.0
4,opinion piece about why singular they should win,329300.0,331279.0
4,"and it did win so I felt very proud, although I'm sure",331280.0,333109.0
4,I can't take complete credit for it,333110.0,334519.0
4,because it was also kind L: but you did campaign,334520.0,336739.0
4,for last year's winner,336740.0,337999.0
4,G: yeah it was kind of zeitgeisty of the,338000.0,339859.0
4,"year, there had been a lot of talk about it and",339860.0,341509.0
4,so I was happy to campaign for it.,341510.0,343339.0
4,This year I was campaigning to keep the,343340.0,346459.0
4,emoji of the year category in L: maybe we,346460.0,348829.0
4,should talk about the categories,348830.0,351109.0
4,in general because the American Dialect,351110.0,353089.0
4,Society Word of the Year,353090.0,354439.0
4,discussion is a pretty elaborate because,354440.0,356239.0
4,they have categories for different types,356240.0,359029.0
4,of words and those categories shift,359030.0,361369.0
4,"and change every year, some of them have",361370.0,363169.0
4,"been around for a long time, some of them",363170.0,364579.0
4,"kind of come and go, and last year you",364580.0,366829.0
4,got an emoji category up G: yeah so the,366830.0,370149.0
4,Word of the Year categories are kind of a,370150.0,373299.0
4,way of focusing conversation around,373300.0,375189.0
4,particular types of things that come up a,375190.0,376839.0
4,fair bit and a way of recognizing that,376840.0,379599.0
4,there are often a whole bunch of words,379600.0,380769.0
4,that are interesting in a given year and,380770.0,383619.0
4,kind of having a more focused discussion,383620.0,385329.0
4,about that rather than just having a,385330.0,386529.0
4,giant list of 20 and having to pick a,386530.0,388719.0
4,single word from that. So some of the,388720.0,390849.0
4,categories include a euphemism of the,390850.0,393819.0
4,"year, most useful, most likely to",393820.0,395799.0
4,"succeed, most creative. These categories",395800.0,398469.0
4,have been around for quite a,398470.0,399789.0
4,while and there's often different types,399790.0,401439.0
4,of domains in those categories. But I was,401440.0,403959.0
4,actually part of a subcommittee to,403960.0,406569.0
4,change some of those categories because,406570.0,408579.0
4,we have had in the past,408580.0,410319.0
4,categories like most unnecessary and the,410320.0,412929.0
4,least less likely to succeed and most,412930.0,414789.0
4,outrageous and those are kind of weird,414790.0,416679.0
4,because you know the words unlikely to,416680.0,418719.0
4,succeed,418720.0,419439.0
4,why are we even voting for it isn't even,419440.0,420819.0
4,a Word of the Year. So sometimes the words,420820.0,422619.0
4,would be weird in that category or,422620.0,424149.0
4,something in most outrageous are most,424150.0,425589.0
4,necessary we would get into this this,425590.0,427509.0
4,discussion whether the word itself,427510.0,429039.0
4,"was unnecessary, or if the concept itself",429040.0,430959.0
4,"was outrageous, which was which.",430960.0,432819.0
4,"So those had turned out kinda weird, so",432820.0,434589.0
4,"we abolished the 'least' categories, least",434590.0,436989.0
4,likely to succeed and most unnecessary for this,436990.0,438939.0
4,year and we added a couple new topic,438940.0,440859.0
4,"based ones, like politics word of the year",440860.0,443079.0
4,and digital word of the year and slang,443080.0,444879.0
4,word of the year the to bring stuff,444880.0,446409.0
4,back into domains rather than the idea of,446410.0,449349.0
4,necessity. I think that was relatively,449350.0,450999.0
4,effective definitely a bit easier to,451000.0,452739.0
4,vote on then trying to determine whether,452740.0,454629.0
4,something is outrageous L: Yeah because one,454630.0,456459.0
4,person's like this is the word i've been,456460.0,458289.0
4,using for years it's completely fine is,458290.0,460179.0
4,another person,460180.0,461079.0
4,oh my gosh how could you even say that,461080.0,463089.0
4,G: it also depends because the room itself,463090.0,464769.0
4,is made up of anybody from the,464770.0,466779.0
4,Linguistics Society of America conference that,466780.0,468579.0
4,wants to attend and so it's got kind of,468580.0,470859.0
4,"a mix, it's got linguists but it's got grad students,",470860.0,473409.0
4,"it's got senior professors, it's got",473410.0,475269.0
4,"undergrads a few of them socialize, it's a bit",475270.0,477129.0
4,of a mix and sometimes you get,477130.0,478299.0
4,someone saying I've never had any of these,478300.0,479679.0
4,words but you look at them and you think well,479680.0,481599.0
4,I don't know how exposed you are,481600.0,483339.0
4,to newer words so it also depends on,483340.0,485619.0
4,kind of where people are coming from,485620.0,487269.0
4,that's why it's a vote I guess L: yeah and,487270.0,488829.0
4,it's right quite a discussion G: yeah it's quite,488830.0,490749.0
4,a discussion and you know in a room full,490750.0,492339.0
4,of a couple hundred people the speeches,492340.0,493869.0
4,from the floor have to be quite short,493870.0,495189.0
4,it's a 30-second like this is,495190.0,496689.0
4,one reason for it does turn into quite a,496690.0,498399.0
4,lively discussion L: so someone mentioned,498400.0,500079.0
4,something about clicking this yeah,500080.0,502439.0
4,G: yeah so one of the things that was new,502440.0,503999.0
4,about the vote this year was that,504000.0,505589.0
4,sometimes when someone would make a,505590.0,507029.0
4,really good point in a little speech,507030.0,509099.0
4,"from the floor, a bunch people would snap their fingers",509100.0,510569.0
4,you would get kind of a wave of,510570.0,512399.0
4,finger-snapping across the room but I,512400.0,514049.0
4,thought was kind of interesting it's,514050.0,515189.0
4,something that hadn't happened in,515190.0,516089.0
4,previous years I think a couple people,516090.0,517619.0
4,started doing it and then they would pop,517620.0,519449.0
4,up when I made a point so that was kind,519450.0,520918.0
4,of a good straw poll way of getting a,520919.0,522449.0
4,sense of how much the room agreed with,522450.0,523859.0
4,someone or disagreed with someone L: is that,523860.0,525209.0
4,a thing from something that i don't know?,525210.0,527669.0
4,G: i'm aware of it as a way to express,527670.0,529259.0
4,agreement with someone like you can say,529260.0,530519.0
4,snaps for this person or do a couple,530520.0,532319.0
4,"fingers snaps, snap snap, so you can snap your",532320.0,534419.0
4,fingers to indicate agreement I've been,534420.0,535769.0
4,aware of it for probably like,535770.0,537239.0
4,10 years by now so it's a thing for,537240.0,539669.0
4,some people L: this kind of brings me to,539670.0,541529.0
4,another kind of you know because i mean,541530.0,544349.0
4,that's not a thing I'm familiar with,544350.0,545819.0
4,but maybe it's a thing that happens,545820.0,547529.0
4,in North America. But we currently have,547530.0,549899.0
4,an Australian and Canadian talking about,549900.0,552149.0
4,the American Dialect Society Word of the,552150.0,554609.0
4,"Year, how has happened? Because this is one",554610.0,557189.0
4,of the biggest and it gets a lot of,557190.0,559019.0
4,press in the days after the,559020.0,561509.0
4,vote and it's taken as one of,561510.0,563579.0
4,the like not definitive but we'll talk,563580.0,566219.0
4,about in a bit like there's a whole,566220.0,567299.0
4,bunch of different dictionaries that give,567300.0,568829.0
4,"their word of the year, but the American",568830.0,570929.0
4,Dialect Society,570930.0,572249.0
4,"vote is one of the biggest events,",572250.0,575099.0
4,why is that do you think? G: I think it's,575100.0,577079.0
4,partly because it's the,577080.0,579299.0
4,oldest event so they've been doing Word,579300.0,581129.0
4,"of the Year since 1998, it was founded by",581130.0,583289.0
4,Alan Metcalf - he's still around he still come to,583290.0,585059.0
4,all the votes but he's passed the,585060.0,586439.0
4,emceeing torch to Ben Zimmer so it's,586440.0,588599.0
4,the oldest of the Word of the Year events,588600.0,590339.0
4,that i think anybody's aware of and the,590340.0,592349.0
4,conference is conveniently timed for,592350.0,594209.0
4,early January so for example the,594210.0,596429.0
4,Canadian Linguistics Association,596430.0,597539.0
4,"conference, which I have been to, meets",597540.0,599459.0
4,in May and it's kind of weird,599460.0,601289.0
4,to select a word of the year in May,601290.0,603029.0
4,and it's also much,603030.0,605039.0
4,smaller. So I think it's considered a large,605040.0,606599.0
4,group of linguists but,606600.0,607769.0
4,there are some weird elements to it,607770.0,609029.0
4,"another weird element, so I'm kind of a",609030.0,610679.0
4,fan of the age range because I think,610680.0,612449.0
4,having a few older people in the room,612450.0,613919.0
4,help keep us from getting too trendy and,613920.0,616199.0
4,having younger people in the room helps,616200.0,617699.0
4,keeps us with the trendy words so i think,617700.0,619619.0
4,the age range of the balance and the,619620.0,620969.0
4,gender range of linguists tends to be really,620970.0,622409.0
4,good but there are more white people,622410.0,625199.0
4,in linguistics and in academia in,625200.0,627179.0
4,general than there are in the population at,627180.0,628769.0
4,large so I don't think we're totally,628770.0,629819.0
4,representative there L: right and,629820.0,631979.0
4,from reading Twitter there was a bit of,631980.0,634619.0
4,"discussion around, and there seems to be",634620.0,637139.0
4,"every year, around in some of the",637140.0,638699.0
4,categories you get a lot of words that come,638700.0,641039.0
4,from African-American varieties of,641040.0,643709.0
4,English. By time white girl,643710.0,646469.0
4,Australian-in-England Lauren hears them,646470.0,649319.0
4,they're like so filtered through many,649320.0,651839.0
4,layers of popular culture but there's,651840.0,653639.0
4,this like tension it seems between,653640.0,655949.0
4,taking these words or borrowing them or,655950.0,659279.0
4,there seems to be something a little bit awkward,659280.0,661109.0
4,about the American Dialect Societies,661110.0,662819.0
4,"relationship with some of these words,",662820.0,664949.0
4,would you say that's something that's,664950.0,666389.0
4,reflected in the event?,666390.0,668399.0
4,G: yeah I think the American Dialect,668400.0,669689.0
4,Society's relationship with these words,669690.0,671489.0
4,is a reflection of our broader societies relationship,671490.0,673709.0
4,with these words. So African-Americans get,673710.0,675839.0
4,stigmatized for themselves speaking African-,675840.0,677819.0
4,American English or themselves,677820.0,679559.0
4,speaking in ways that differ from what,679560.0,681839.0
4,we consider educated English what we,681840.0,683519.0
4,consider mainstream English and can,683520.0,685649.0
4,get penalized on the job market and stuff like,685650.0,687149.0
4,that and yet suddenly some of these words,687150.0,689069.0
4,get adopted as cool and and become popular,689070.0,691739.0
4,when they weren't as popular in the,691740.0,693329.0
4,mouths of the original people that were,693330.0,694379.0
4,saying them and so I think justifiably,694380.0,696839.0
4,that's not fair. I think,696840.0,699149.0
4,the American Dialect Society but Word of,699150.0,701549.0
4,the Year vote can in some cases reflect,701550.0,703619.0
4,that words for African-American English,703620.0,704909.0
4,get brought into mainstream society get,704910.0,706589.0
4,picked up in places like,706590.0,708119.0
4,BuzzFeed get picked up by white,708120.0,710159.0
4,celebrities and white suburban teenagers,710160.0,712619.0
4,and things like this and I think this is,712620.0,714209.0
4,a process that does happen and so in a,714210.0,716039.0
4,sense that you're chronically things,716040.0,717569.0
4,that do happen it's not necessarily,717570.0,719609.0
4,inappropriate for the American Dialect Society,719610.0,721139.0
4,to be reflecting that but also,721140.0,722729.0
4,to be making sure to reflect these,722730.0,723989.0
4,words have a longer history and have a,723990.0,725369.0
4,longer context and that we owe them to,725370.0,727619.0
4,the people that originally came up with,727620.0,729089.0
4,them and that you can't just talk about,729090.0,731339.0
4,them as if they started in 2016 or in a,731340.0,734129.0
4,particular year without that,734130.0,736139.0
4,context before that L: okay that makes,736140.0,737699.0
4,sense G: I think that the long-term,737700.0,739739.0
4,solution is when you look at how words,739740.0,741839.0
4,get borrowed from one language to,741840.0,743189.0
4,another or one culture to,743190.0,744809.0
4,another they often reflected the,744810.0,746399.0
4,existing power relationships that exist,746400.0,748259.0
4,between those cultures. So words get borrowed,748260.0,750329.0
4,between English and French but this,750330.0,751739.0
4,isn't as fraught because,751740.0,753239.0
4,English and French have had a relatively,753240.0,754769.0
4,egalitarian power relationship through,754770.0,756599.0
4,"history, but that's not true for all of",756600.0,758939.0
4,the words that have been borrowed in,758940.0,760199.0
4,English whether that's from,760200.0,760949.0
4,African-Americans or whether that's from indigenous,760950.0,762539.0
4,peoples for other people whose history,762540.0,764249.0
4,has been erased as their words have been,764250.0,766019.0
4,borrowed those histories can be more,766020.0,767869.0
4,fraught and I think the least we can do is,767870.0,769729.0
4,acknowledge that and give them credit,769730.0,771559.0
4,for their linguistic creativity when,771560.0,773269.0
4,"we're doing that, but ultimately",773270.0,774769.0
4,the way to make the power,774770.0,777709.0
4,relationships less weird around,777710.0,779209.0
4,those words being borrowed is to make,779210.0,781699.0
4,those power relations be less weird in,781700.0,783229.0
4,society in general L: and I feel like that's why I,783230.0,784969.0
4,really appreciate the Twitter feed that,784970.0,787429.0
4,happens around the World of the Year,787430.0,789169.0
4,because I get a much more diverse kind,789170.0,790759.0
4,of perspective on these words and how,790760.0,792739.0
4,people feel about them,792740.0,794359.0
4,I feel like that kind of helps,794360.0,795379.0
4,influence my awareness about words and their,795380.0,798409.0
4,history especially from groups that I'm,798410.0,800389.0
4,not in regular contact with G: I will say as,800390.0,802189.0
4,someone who has been at the voting for a,802190.0,803809.0
4,number of years there are a number of,803810.0,805369.0
4,people who make these points in the,805370.0,807409.0
4,speeches from the floor during the,807410.0,808338.0
4,voting as well and I think they often sway,808339.0,809899.0
4,the audience towards or against particular,809900.0,811939.0
4,words based on what's going on there,811940.0,813829.0
4,pointing out the history of these words,813830.0,815419.0
4,it's a bit tricky with the nomination,815420.0,817099.0
4,process to trace the full history of these,817100.0,818899.0
4,words as they're being nominated in the,818900.0,820309.0
4,same hour that we're doing the voting so,820310.0,822559.0
4,some of that history taking happens,822560.0,823999.0
4,afterwards L: fair enough G: but I think,824000.0,825859.0
4,"continuing to point this out, continuing to",825860.0,827629.0
4,point out that just because a word hits,827630.0,829969.0
4,prominence in The New York Time say,829970.0,832278.0
4,doesn't mean it's actually new that,832279.0,833958.0
4,"particular year, it may have a",833959.0,834889.0
4,ten-year-old or 50 year old history,834890.0,836838.0
4,among different group of people that we need to,836839.0,837799.0
4,recognize L: I mean we talked about this,837800.0,840528.0
4,with singular they and the pronouns,840529.0,842269.0
4,"episode, that it has a history that",842270.0,844759.0
4,spans centuries it's just that it,844760.0,846769.0
4,felt like it was being talked about,846770.0,848119.0
4,and that the time was right for 2015,848120.0,850969.0
4,G: yeah so the criteria for especially the,850970.0,853369.0
4,American Dialect Society Word of the Year,853370.0,854958.0
4,is not necessarily new but newly,854959.0,856729.0
4,prominent because the year in which a word,856730.0,859039.0
4,is new it's often nobody really notices,859040.0,861409.0
4,at all and so it's when it feels prominent.,861410.0,864109.0
4,In practice the way that gets enforced,864110.0,865579.0
4,is when a word that has been nominated,865580.0,868219.0
4,"before gets nominated again, Ben Zimmer",868220.0,869989.0
4,will just say oh yeah we had that word,869990.0,871278.0
4,back in this year because he somehow,871279.0,872599.0
4,seems to know all of these L: he's a Word of the Year,872600.0,874969.0
4,oracle G: basically if it hasn't been,874970.0,876708.0
4,nominated before then it's fair game,876709.0,878869.0
4,and somehow Ben Zimmer just knows all,878870.0,880579.0
4,of the words that have ever been nominated,880580.0,881629.0
4,L: useful man to have around,881630.0,883338.0
4,G: yes it's very useful L: we haven't even,883339.0,884989.0
4,talked about the winner yet of the American,884990.0,887599.0
4,Dialect Society,887600.0,888559.0
4,Word of the Year G: that's true we haven't talked,888560.0,890749.0
4,"about the winner. So the overall winner,",890750.0,892669.0
4,"in case you somehow missed this, the overall",892670.0,894919.0
4,winner was dumpster fire which can,894920.0,896809.0
4,also optionally be expressed as an emoji,896810.0,898489.0
4,with the wastebasket and the fire,898490.0,900258.0
4,emoji but we did vote for it in its,900259.0,902568.0
4,conventional English orthography and I,902569.0,904308.0
4,think partly people felt like that was a,904309.0,905898.0
4,very good word to sum up what 2016 had,905899.0,907909.0
4,been and also how people have been,907910.0,909438.0
4,talking about 2016 in terms of all of,909439.0,911539.0
4,the bad things that had happened that year,911540.0,913219.0
4,L: yeah so it was my nomination in my,913220.0,915768.0
4,three weeks before the vote tweet so I,915769.0,917988.0
4,feel G: congratulations L: very smug that,917989.0,920058.0
4,I am of the zeitgeist G: you are on,920059.0,923028.0
4,trend! L: none of my specific category,923029.0,925248.0
4,"votes were correct, I'll put them in the",925249.0,927738.0
4,"show notes, but my Word of the Year was",927739.0,930528.0
4,"the one that won. Awkwardly though, my",930529.0,933498.0
4,super backward Android phone doesn't,933499.0,935808.0
4,have the wastepaper basket in my emoji,935809.0,938088.0
4,library so I can't even emoji,938089.0,940458.0
4,tweet the Word of the Year which is a,940459.0,942378.0
4,bit of a tech fail G: if you copy paste it from,942379.0,944418.0
4,somewhere L: I could it's getting very,944419.0,946159.0
4,elaborate by that point. So it kind of it,946160.0,948828.0
4,with a dual so the word is the Word of,948829.0,950958.0
4,the Year but people are also using the,950959.0,952698.0
4,emoji as well,952699.0,954349.0
4,G: people are also using the emoji as well I,954350.0,955998.0
4,think there was some discussion about,955999.0,957198.0
4,whether the wastebasket is a very good,957199.0,958788.0
4,dumpster because obviously those are,958789.0,960318.0
4,quite different shapes I think initially,960319.0,961668.0
4,at least when I had started using the,961669.0,963349.0
4,"wastebasket + fire, I had been using",963350.0,965659.0
4,to stand for trash fire or obviously something that,965660.0,967518.0
4,means the same thing L: which in my dialect,967519.0,969648.0
4,"is rubbish fire, or bin fire",969649.0,972288.0
4,G: I would really say garbage fire probably,972289.0,973938.0
4,because trash to me reads as American,973939.0,975588.0
4,so trash fire or garbage fire i've been,975589.0,977599.0
4,using the wastebasket for which i think,977600.0,979518.0
4,is a perfectly reasonable use of the,979519.0,980719.0
4,wastebasket. But then of course,980720.0,982219.0
4,because dumpster fires a synonym for that,982220.0,983568.0
4,then you get the dumpster fire,983569.0,985308.0
4,"L: and there's been some good commentary on it,",985309.0,987138.0
4,we'll link to Ben Zimmer's Language Log posts,987139.0,989628.0
4,and Nancy Friedman's post on her blog,989629.0,992628.0
4,about dumpster fire as the winner G: I will,992629.0,994849.0
4,say that there's also something else,994850.0,996018.0
4,that comes up in pretty much every Word,996019.0,998088.0
4,of the Year vote is when a word reflects,998089.0,1001178.0
4,a political idea or an event or,1001179.0,1004988.0
4,"particular concept, is voting for that",1004989.0,1008738.0
4,particular word a political endorsement,1008739.0,1011708.0
4,or is that simply a reflection that a,1011709.0,1013658.0
4,thing has happened even if you don't,1013659.0,1014888.0
4,agree with the fact that that's happened and,1014889.0,1016478.0
4,that was something that came up,1016479.0,1017198.0
4,especially this year,1017199.0,1018248.0
4,L: ok so this isn't the American Dialect Society,1018249.0,1020108.0
4,admitting that 2016 was really bad,1020109.0,1023648.0
4,by voting for this word G: well dumpster,1023649.0,1026648.0
4,fire is comparatively neutral but if you,1026649.0,1028208.0
4,look at some of the other categories and we,1028209.0,1029499.0
4,look at some of the discussion that,1029500.0,1030489.0
4,"happened during that vote, so things",1030490.0,1031958.0
4,like deplorables and nasty,1031959.0,1033349.0
4,women were nominated there was some,1033350.0,1035269.0
4,discussion about altright although,1035270.0,1036588.0
4,don't know that is end up actually being nominated and,1036589.0,1038719.0
4,these are certainly words that were used,1038720.0,1039769.0
4,a lot in 2016,1039770.0,1041389.0
4,but is the nomination of them going to,1041390.0,1043099.0
4,be taken as an endorsement and in some case,1043100.0,1044659.0
4,"it is, that's the thing",1044660.0,1046129.0
4,so last year when singular they was the,1046130.0,1049038.0
4,one that was nominated I read several,1049039.0,1050629.0
4,articles in the month thereafter saying,1050630.0,1052668.0
4,well one of the reasons why you should,1052669.0,1054769.0
4,"use singular they, it has a long history,",1054770.0,1055999.0
4,it solves a convenient gender,1056000.0,1058579.0
4,neutrality problem but also the American,1058580.0,1060469.0
4,Dialect Society has endorsed it and so it,1060470.0,1062538.0
4,does have that signaling function L: right,1062539.0,1064519.0
4,and we can't just say well it's a positive word,1064520.0,1066079.0
4,so we voted for it as an endorsement and,1066080.0,1068389.0
4,its the negative words so we voted for,1068390.0,1070249.0
4,it as a warning,1070250.0,1072259.0
4,G: yeah and then the previous year the,1072260.0,1074058.0
4,hashtag black lives matter was voted for,1074059.0,1075918.0
4,and so I think that was again saying,1075919.0,1077899.0
4,this was a significant event that,1077900.0,1079548.0
4,happened in a particular year but it's,1079549.0,1080899.0
4,also saying the American Dialect Society,1080900.0,1082519.0
4,the people who are voting for that,1082520.0,1083658.0
4,particular Word of the Year would also,1083659.0,1085189.0
4,like to assert that black lives matter.,1085190.0,1086839.0
4,It's hard to separate the political and,1086840.0,1089119.0
4,social functions of words from simply,1089120.0,1091038.0
4,their descriptive nature even though you,1091039.0,1092839.0
4,would like to do that sometimes as,1092840.0,1093918.0
4,linguists L: so obviously dumpster fire was,1093919.0,1097189.0
4,"the ADS Word of the Year winner, but it seems",1097190.0,1100519.0
4,like every dictionary has its own word of,1100520.0,1102529.0
4,the year there's words of the year all over,1102530.0,1105168.0
4,"the place at the end of the year, it's",1105169.0,1107178.0
4,becoming an increasingly popular sport,1107179.0,1109428.0
4,G: I mean it's such a good PR opportunity,1109429.0,1110869.0
4,"L: is this just a PR opportunity, is this",1110870.0,1114079.0
4,why people do this? G: I mean,1114080.0,1116298.0
4,you can't deny that you do get a bit of,1116299.0,1117649.0
4,press out of that and people like,1117650.0,1119058.0
4,reporting on it and there's a bit of a,1119059.0,1120529.0
4,sense I think among various groups of,1120530.0,1122389.0
4,people that various dictionaries and,1122390.0,1123949.0
4,others that you talked to that places,1123950.0,1125658.0
4,try to choose different words of the,1125659.0,1126769.0
4,year because if you pick the same word,1126770.0,1128538.0
4,of the year as someone else then you're not,1128539.0,1130668.0
4,as interesting from a reporting side or,1130669.0,1132769.0
4,you're not making,1132770.0,1134029.0
4,your own statement so i think that there,1134030.0,1136219.0
4,was a widespread expectation that,1136220.0,1137479.0
4,Oxford dictionaries was going to choose,1137480.0,1138769.0
4,Brexit because they're L: because they're the,1138770.0,1140689.0
4,British one G: and then when they didn't,1140690.0,1142668.0
4,maybe that freed up Collins Dictionary,1142669.0,1144168.0
4,to choose Brexit L: Oxford Dictionary chose post truth,1144169.0,1147529.0
4,"for anyone who's interested, we'll link to",1147530.0,1149509.0
4,all these G: and they also pick different,1149510.0,1151459.0
4,methodologies for choosing their words of,1151460.0,1153979.0
4,the year so the American Dialect Society,1153980.0,1155389.0
4,has this big vote and at that point,1155390.0,1157219.0
4,we're aware of what everyone else has,1157220.0,1158689.0
4,chosen so there's often a bit of a,1158690.0,1160009.0
4,tendency to not bother so much and,1160010.0,1161629.0
4,the American Dialect Society vote,1161630.0,1163069.0
4,specifically focuses on new words,1163070.0,1164509.0
4,whereas several of the other,1164510.0,1166279.0
4,dictionaries,1166280.0,1167029.0
4,because they have statistics and what,1167030.0,1168349.0
4,people have been looking up a lot they,1168350.0,1169579.0
4,often focus on the words that have had a,1169580.0,1171109.0
4,particular spike that year or that have,1171110.0,1173479.0
4,been looked up more often than normal,1173480.0,1175279.0
4,and go for that and so those different,1175280.0,1176809.0
4,methodologies will also tend to lead,1176810.0,1178099.0
4,them to different words,1178100.0,1179239.0
4,"for dictionary.com for example, because I happen",1179240.0,1180949.0
4,to be talking with Jane Solomon about,1180950.0,1182359.0
4,this they had a spike in xenophobia,1182360.0,1184369.0
4,around Brexit and I think also around,1184370.0,1186409.0
4,the U.S. election so they were a couple,1186410.0,1187969.0
4,different spikes there for,1187970.0,1189349.0
4,Merriam-Webster their word was surreal,1189350.0,1191299.0
4,and in previous years they've had words,1191300.0,1192919.0
4,like science so they tend to choose the,1192920.0,1194629.0
4,words that have just an overall high in,1194630.0,1196999.0
4,that given year without particular spikes,1197000.0,1198919.0
4,and that will tend to bias you towards,1198920.0,1200509.0
4,"more common words, so that's",1200510.0,1202249.0
4,why you get stuff like surreal and,1202250.0,1203479.0
4,science. So I think partly people,1203480.0,1205369.0
4,try to choose different methodologies to keep it,1205370.0,1206599.0
4,interesting you know and then if it,1206600.0,1208189.0
4,comes with some PR I don't think anyone's,1208190.0,1209599.0
4,objecting to that L: the Australian,1209600.0,1212209.0
4,National Dictionary Center vote for,1212210.0,1214519.0
4,their word of the year and,1214520.0,1216349.0
4,they kind of do an internal office,1216350.0,1217909.0
4,discussion thing and they have shortlist,1217910.0,1219739.0
4,and then they have a winner,1219740.0,1220879.0
4,I'm very pleased that this year's,1220880.0,1223009.0
4,the 2016 word of the year for the ANDC was,1223010.0,1226129.0
4,democracy sausage G: so you might need to,1226130.0,1228319.0
4,explain what that is L: so a democracy,1228320.0,1230599.0
4,sausage - earliest sources tend to be,1230600.0,1232789.0
4,around 2012 but we had an election in 2016,1232790.0,1235699.0
4,and they were very popular in 2016 -,1235700.0,1237919.0
4,because we have this great system called,1237920.0,1240079.0
4,"compulsory voting, when you vote, which",1240080.0,1242149.0
4,"you have to, afterwards often like the",1242150.0,1245239.0
4,local schools and local charities will,1245240.0,1247339.0
4,set up a BBQ out the front and be,1247340.0,1249649.0
4,cooking sausages which is known as a,1249650.0,1251749.0
4,sausage sizzle and you can buy yourself,1251750.0,1254599.0
4,a sausage in a piece of bread maybe with,1254600.0,1257359.0
4,some tomato sauce and onions and this is,1257360.0,1260779.0
4,"this is the cornerstone of democracy,",1260780.0,1261859.0
4,the thing I was most excited about,1261860.0,1264379.0
4,after I was 18 and I got to vote for the,1264380.0,1266569.0
4,first time was that I got to vote and then I,1266570.0,1268759.0
4,got to go out and have a sausage from,1268760.0,1270739.0
4,the sausage sizzle afterwards and this,1270740.0,1273619.0
4,year thanks to the wonders of technology,1273620.0,1275119.0
4,people got really into setting up like,1275120.0,1277579.0
4,sausage sizzle finder apps so you could,1277580.0,1280279.0
4,find a really good way to find a,1280280.0,1282049.0
4,democracy sausage after voting G: I don't,1282050.0,1284689.0
4,know why all voting booth don't have,1284690.0,1287059.0
4,these in other countries like I would,1287060.0,1288409.0
4,like some democracy sausages in Canada,1288410.0,1290089.0
4,please,1290090.0,1290749.0
4,L: yeah it's just part of it,1290750.0,1293149.0
4,being like an event G: that sounds really,1293150.0,1295309.0
4,fun and it's definitely a very Australian,1295310.0,1297139.0
4,word because we don't have them.,1297140.0,1298699.0
4,I looked up to see,1298700.0,1300529.0
4,as the resident Canadian whether anybody had,1300530.0,1301939.0
4,ever declared a Canadian word of the,1301940.0,1303319.0
4,year and I'm very dissapointed to report,1303320.0,1304969.0
4,that I did not find much. So there was,1304970.0,1306769.0
4,some guy who was declaring word of the,1306770.0,1308509.0
4,year for 2009 to 2012 and then just kind,1308510.0,1311569.0
4,of stopped but I think this is something,1311570.0,1313129.0
4,I might need to get going.,1313130.0,1314539.0
4,I might need to get,1314540.0,1315769.0
4,my friends of the Canadian Linguistics,1315770.0,1317359.0
4,"Association, I do you have many",1317360.0,1319099.0
4,friends at the Canadian Linguistics,1319100.0,1320089.0
4,Association and I might need to get them on that,1320090.0,1321559.0
4,because everybody else gets their,1321560.0,1323269.0
4,PR ofp but L: yeah it's Canada's turn,1323270.0,1325999.0
4,G: yeah it's Canada's turn. So we'll have to see if we can get a,1326000.0,1328609.0
4,Canadian word of the year declared next,1328610.0,1330109.0
4,year. And there are other stuff from,1330110.0,1332389.0
4,"other countries though, we're not",1332390.0,1334249.0
4,going to list all the countries but Austria,1334250.0,1335419.0
4,had a particularly interesting word of,1335420.0,1337249.0
4,the year from their election and in my,1337250.0,1339709.0
4,best German this word is 51 or 52 letter,1339710.0,1343099.0
4,long I didn't count,1343100.0,1344179.0
4,reports vary. The Austrian Word of the Year is,1344180.0,1346899.0
4,'Bundespräsidentenstichwahlwiederholungsverschiebung',1346900.0,1349729.0
4,and it means something,1349730.0,1351649.0
4,"like have a recount of the election, to do",1351650.0,1354379.0
4,the election twice and this is something,1354380.0,1356209.0
4,that apparently happened in Austria this,1356210.0,1357979.0
4,year so people were talking about it a lot,1357980.0,1359839.0
4,L: there's also a Dutch sign language word,1359840.0,1362389.0
4,of the year. The Dutch sign language word of,1362390.0,1364159.0
4,the year is you put your hand flat on,1364160.0,1367069.0
4,your head and then you lift your fingers,1367070.0,1369139.0
4,up kind of 90 degrees and put them back,1369140.0,1371749.0
4,down again which is the Dutch sign,1371750.0,1373969.0
4,language sign for Donald Trump. You,1373970.0,1376339.0
4,may be able to figure out where the iconicity,1376340.0,1377779.0
4,for that one comes from. So Dutch sign,1377780.0,1380659.0
4,language declared a sign of the year,1380660.0,1382099.0
4,which was pretty cool G: I asked a linguist who,1382100.0,1384499.0
4,works on sign language if there was an,1384500.0,1385729.0
4,American Sign Language word the year,1385730.0,1386959.0
4,and she said 'oh no there isn't but that's an,1386960.0,1388849.0
4,interesting idea!' so maybe stay tuned L: 2017!,1388850.0,1392359.0
4,G: if there is another ASL sign,1392360.0,1395089.0
4,of the year or Auslan sign of the year,1395090.0,1396709.0
4,we will be sure to report back L: something,1396710.0,1398269.0
4,that people may be wondering by this,1398270.0,1399919.0
4,"point in the conversation, having talked",1399920.0,1401539.0
4,"about the Dutch sign, the Australian",1401540.0,1403909.0
4,"democracy sausage, the dumpster file",1403910.0,1406609.0
4,"which is also in emoji form, by the time you get to",1406610.0,1409159.0
4,this point you thinking what even,1409160.0,1411049.0
4,is a word right? G: Because the word of the,1411050.0,1412909.0
4,year is often a phrase L: well the Austrian one,1412910.0,1415219.0
4,is basically like a sentence in English,1415220.0,1417049.0
4,"G: the Austrian would be a sentence in English, well it would be",1417050.0,1419209.0
4,kind of a compound noun in English and,1419210.0,1421039.0
4,you know the previous year singular they,1421040.0,1422629.0
4,wasn't 'they' itself it was the fact that,1422630.0,1424519.0
4,they was being used as singular that was,1424520.0,1426259.0
4,a specific part of the words that we were,1426260.0,1427639.0
4,looking at and yeah this does get us,1427640.0,1429169.0
4,into the question of what even is a word,1429170.0,1430279.0
4,L: and by time you're kind of done with,1430280.0,1432229.0
4,this you realize that linguists,1432230.0,1433699.0
4,play pretty fast and loose with the,1433700.0,1436069.0
4,definition of words. The unit of the word,1436070.0,1439249.0
4,unless you're a dictionary maker or,1439250.0,1441469.0
4,a lexicographer or something really specific,1441470.0,1443928.0
4,like that you don't often think about,1443929.0,1445548.0
4,"words when you're doing linguistics,",1445549.0,1447648.0
4,weirdly enough,1447649.0,1448699.0
4,G: e i think,1448700.0,1450259.0
4,the average person thinks about a word,1450260.0,1451548.0
4,as like something with spaces around it,1451549.0,1453259.0
4,but that really complicated really,1453260.0,1454939.0
4,"quickly so if you think about numbers,",1454940.0,1456798.0
4,22 when it's written in numerals doesn't,1456799.0,1459558.0
4,have spaces but when it's written in words,1459559.0,1461749.0
4,"you can put a space in between it, you can",1461750.0,1463158.0
4,put a dash in between it and lots of,1463159.0,1464569.0
4,compounds you can put a hyphen there or,1464570.0,1466249.0
4,not out a hyphen there and does that make,1466250.0,1468229.0
4,it two words now? I mean if you're,1468230.0,1470028.0
4,writing an essay for a class and you,1470029.0,1471469.0
4,have a word count maybe but intuitively,1471470.0,1473479.0
4,22 with and without the hyphen mean the,1473480.0,1475939.0
4,same thing where they should be the,1475940.0,1477259.0
4,same word. Or if you take something like,1477260.0,1478969.0
4,website you can write that open web-space-site,1478970.0,1482449.0
4,or website altogether and those should,1482450.0,1485089.0
4,"be the same thing, and linguists would",1485090.0,1486798.0
4,say those were the same thing L: yeah so something like,1486799.0,1489319.0
4,like dumpster fire or democracy sausage,1489320.0,1491749.0
4,they are nouns that they made up of,1491750.0,1494148.0
4,other words so we think of them as,1494149.0,1496129.0
4,compound nouns in linguistics you know,1496130.0,1498558.0
4,I've kind of come to the point where I,1498559.0,1500119.0
4,just try and tell people the word of the,1500120.0,1502009.0
4,year is like word as in like a single,1502010.0,1505038.0
4,semantic sense that has kind of one,1505039.0,1507408.0
4,label and maybe that label is a compound,1507409.0,1509928.0
4,noun and sometimes that label as a,1509929.0,1511908.0
4,single word and sometimes that label is,1511909.0,1513469.0
4,an emoji. But language doesn't always,1513470.0,1515898.0
4,just go with the white spaces,1515899.0,1518028.0
4,G: yeah and the white spaces are themselves,1518029.0,1519408.0
4,artificial because you learn to,1519409.0,1520969.0
4,speak before you learn how to write and,1520970.0,1523339.0
4,so you know your when the words come out,1523340.0,1525349.0
4,of your mouth in a speech stream you're,1525350.0,1526548.0
4,not pausing between every single word,1526549.0,1528469.0
4,you definitely don't have to pause between every,1528470.0,1529788.0
4,single word the way you need to put,1529789.0,1531349.0
4,white spaces between words when you,1531350.0,1532579.0
4,write them so website you say without a,1532580.0,1534798.0
4,pause in between it regardless of,1534799.0,1536778.0
4,what you do with the spacing or something,1536779.0,1538038.0
4,like that,1538039.0,1538699.0
4,I think the best quote that I have about,1538700.0,1540439.0
4,what a word is so it was back,1540440.0,1542839.0
4,when I was teaching and I had,1542840.0,1544219.0
4,student that came up to me about halfway through,1544220.0,1545959.0
4,the intro course and said I'm really enjoying,1545960.0,1547879.0
4,this course but the problem is before,1547880.0,1550668.0
4,undertaking linguistics I thought I knew,1550669.0,1552229.0
4,what a word it and now we've been,1552230.0,1554418.0
4,getting into it more I just really have,1554419.0,1555829.0
4,no idea and I said congratulations,1555830.0,1557839.0
4,you've become a linguist. Because I would say,1557840.0,1562308.0
4,I've been to conferences about,1562309.0,1565759.0
4,word formation,1565760.0,1567229.0
4,and a conference I went to a couple years ago,1567230.0,1568639.0
4,which was entirely about words and how,1568640.0,1571548.0
4,they get put together and someone kind,1571549.0,1573558.0
4,of made a joke to this room of a hundred,1573559.0,1575418.0
4,or so linguists saying yeah well you,1575419.0,1577009.0
4,know nobody really knows what a word,1577010.0,1578149.0
4,is there was like laughing and agreeing,1578150.0,1579949.0
4,you know if you ask group of a linguists what a,1579950.0,1582289.0
4,word is I don't think there's a clear consesus,1582290.0,1584178.0
4,because it's not clear when you should,1584179.0,1586099.0
4,put spaces when you shouldn't put spaces.,1586100.0,1588079.0
4,it's not clear there's,1588080.0,1589489.0
4,somethings that definitely aren't words or,1589490.0,1590928.0
4,somethings that definitely are but there's,1590929.0,1592219.0
4,a lot of stuff on the margins L: and,1592220.0,1593959.0
4,"that's even only in one language,",1593960.0,1595279.0
4,let alone across the world's languages G: so,1595280.0,1598159.0
4,instead of words linguist tend to talk,1598160.0,1600558.0
4,about units of meaning and units of,1600559.0,1602928.0
4,sound and in theory a word is units,1602929.0,1606229.0
4,that combine sound and meeting. So in,1606230.0,1609229.0
4,linguistics you have a morpheme which is,1609230.0,1611209.0
4,some unit of sound that also has a,1611210.0,1613849.0
4,particular meaning and it's very clear,1613850.0,1616249.0
4,that something is or isn't a morpheme,1616250.0,1617959.0
4,because it has some sort of sound,1617960.0,1619609.0
4,associated with it has some sort of,1619610.0,1621109.0
4,meaning associated with it it doesn't,1621110.0,1622729.0
4,matter whether that morpheme is attached,1622730.0,1624168.0
4,to another morpheme or all by itself,1624169.0,1626269.0
4,"is a word, that's a unified thing to talk",1626270.0,1628428.0
4,about,1628429.0,1628939.0
4,but I've also realized as we're,1628940.0,1630349.0
4,talking about what's a word that I,1630350.0,1631759.0

5,exciting and I don't want to be one of,48370.0,49898.0
5,those people that holds exciting,49899.0,51788.0
5,projects over people's heads but I've,51789.0,53828.0
5,been doing some work with nineteen,53829.0,55779.0
5,seventies data recordings,55780.0,57849.0

5,working on L: Awesome. I'm so excited that,104020.0,106959.0
5,"LingWiki, the linguistics wikipedia editing",106960.0,109599.0
5,thing is having a season in Hawaii,109600.0,112358.0
5,The ICLDC conference is so,112359.0,114249.0
5,great it has such a good community and,114250.0,116228.0
5,i'm sure ICLDC7 will be a hashtag,116229.0,119949.0
5,with lots of action on it in late,119950.0,121868.0

5,"tweet something about that, I'm sure I'll",125140.0,126728.0
5,be tweeting from my own twitter account on,126729.0,128049.0
5,that hashtag. I don't know how much people,128050.0,129549.0
5,use hashtags at gesture conferences so,129550.0,131469.0
5,maybe check out Lauren's L: lots!,131470.0,134439.0
5,"G: oh good! ok good, you just have to take photos of the",134440.0,136839.0
5,gestures L: yeah i'll add a link in the,136840.0,138639.0
5,show notes as well to the iGesto hashtags.,138640.0,141159.0
5,That's what Twitters photos are for!,141160.0,143379.0
5,"G: Ahhh photos, I forgot about those photos!",143380.0,155029.0
5,L: I am so excited that today's topic is,155030.0,159318.0
5,colours and colour and language. You,159319.0,163219.0
5,may be wondering why we would be,163220.0,165049.0
5,interested in talking about colour and,165050.0,166999.0
5,language at the same time and that is,167000.0,169159.0
5,for a number of reasons. If you take a,169160.0,171649.0
5,cross-linguistic perspective you find,171650.0,173479.0
5,that there are a variety of ways in,173480.0,175789.0
5,which different languages cut up the,175790.0,177949.0
5,colour space in order to talk about them,177950.0,180109.0
5,that had some really interesting,180110.0,181068.0
5,implications,181069.0,182359.0
5,G: yeah so I guess the simple reason is,182360.0,184669.0
5,colours are things that we have words for,184670.0,186679.0
5,but not all languages have the same,186680.0,188449.0
5,"words for the same colours, so you have a",188450.0,191119.0
5,potentially visual spectrum of,191120.0,193099.0
5,possible colors that exists and,193100.0,194779.0
5,languages that carve up that visual,194780.0,196429.0
5,spectrum in some ways that are similar,196430.0,197689.0
5,in some ways that are different. So,197690.0,199279.0
5,"Lauren you have a story for us L: I have,",199280.0,201589.0
5,"conveniently, two languages that I've",201590.0,203929.0
5,learnt at two point in my life illustrate,203930.0,205969.0
5,this really neatly. So when I was in,205970.0,207559.0
5,primary school we were 'taught' - I'll put,207560.0,211549.0
5,that in some quote marks - Italian and I,211550.0,214729.0
5,still remember in grade five or six,214730.0,217429.0
5,you had to describe a,217430.0,219768.0
5,"face and I wrote, and and this will",219769.0,222349.0
5,probably not be grammatical Italian,222350.0,223909.0
5,because I'm remembering what,223910.0,224899.0
5,"eleven-year-old Lauren knew, but I wrote",224900.0,226939.0
5,"something like 'occhi blu', so that",226940.0,229609.0
5,"person has blue eyes, 'blu' being the",229610.0,232729.0
5,Italian word for blue. And my Italian,232730.0,235399.0
5,teacher was like 'meeeeh that's a fine... I mean I,235400.0,238759.0
5,understand what you mean but the person,238760.0,240589.0
5,actually has occhi azuro'. Or there's,240590.0,243229.0
5,probably an adjective conjugation,243230.0,246619.0
5,there that I need to do that I haven't,246620.0,248839.0
5,done but for eyes for this Italian,248840.0,251839.0
5,teacher you don't use the word 'blu' you,251840.0,253548.0
5,use the word 'azuro'. And people have,253549.0,256038.0
5,argued that Italian actually has two,256039.0,258228.0
5,basic color words for what we think of,258229.0,260719.0
5,as blue and 'blu' covers everything,260720.0,262699.0
5,that's like royal blue and really rich,262700.0,264978.0
5,blues and darker and azuro is like,264979.0,266989.0
5,light blue and sky blue. So I didn't,266990.0,269779.0
5,really get it as an eleven-year-old and,269780.0,271429.0
5,it's still hard for me to think,271430.0,273228.0
5,of this but then when I started learning,273229.0,275029.0
5,"Yolmo, which is a Tibetan language",275030.0,277909.0
5,"spoken in Nepal, they have one word",277910.0,281149.0
5,for blue but that word also includes,281150.0,283819.0
5,most of what we think of as green and,283820.0,285799.0
5,this is sufficiently common it's not,285800.0,287749.0
5,that unusual,287750.0,288739.0
5,for languages to have one word that covers,288740.0,291198.0
5,everything we describe as blue and green,291199.0,293149.0
5,and it's so common that these are often,293150.0,294649.0
5,referred to as languages that have a,294650.0,296119.0
5,"color 'grue', which is the word I like",296120.0,298399.0
5,very much G: so that is a portmanteau of,298400.0,300529.0
5,"'green' and 'blue', in case anyone really needed",300530.0,303258.0
5,that explain to them,303259.0,304279.0
5,I don't know L: thanks for,304280.0,307008.0
5,explaining that I think it's,307009.0,309258.0
5,good that you've explained it. So you have,309259.0,311418.0
5,Italian which creates divisions across,311419.0,314478.0
5,what we think of as one colour and a,314479.0,316519.0
5,language like Yolo which covers,316520.0,318469.0
5,what we think of as two colors with one,318470.0,321019.0
5,word and this is something that happens,321020.0,323689.0
5,pretty commonly across the world's,323690.0,325429.0
5,languages,325430.0,326388.0
5,"G: yeah, I mean the the light",326389.0,328279.0
5,blue dark/blue things may seem weird to,328280.0,329989.0
5,English speakers but if you think of the,329990.0,331788.0
5,"five words for red and pink, where pink is",331789.0,334038.0
5,really just a light red and historically,334039.0,336348.0
5,"English didn't have a word for pink, you",336349.0,338239.0
5,can kind of get a sense of,338240.0,339379.0
5,imagine if we did the same thing but for,339380.0,340939.0
5,blue,340940.0,341538.0
5,L: yeah and people had been kind of aware,341539.0,344359.0
5,of these differences across languages,344360.0,346068.0
5,but the study that's often cited as the,346069.0,348739.0
5,thing that kicked off a kind of,348740.0,350478.0
5,consistent research agenda in colour,350479.0,353629.0
5,terms across languages is a study by,353630.0,355758.0
5,Brent Berlin and Paul Kay from the nineteen,355759.0,358339.0
5,seventies. Oh it was actually published in,358340.0,360109.0
5,"nineteen sixty-nine, the monograph. So this was",360110.0,362478.0
5,research done in the late sixties and,362479.0,364939.0
5,then was really popular and replicated,364940.0,367339.0
5,and discussed a lot in the,367340.0,369109.0
5,seventies and eighties G: I think they did a,369110.0,370788.0
5,"second study in the seventies and eighties,",370789.0,372258.0
5,"they did it again, but more broadly.",372259.0,373968.0
5,So the bigger one that they get cited on,373969.0,375799.0
5,is from the seventies. Yeah so they decided that they,375800.0,379459.0
5,"wanted to, the first pilot version",379460.0,381918.0
5,of the sixties they got some 20,381919.0,384168.0
5,people or so who spoke some languages that,384169.0,386179.0
5,"they knew, you kind of wander around",386180.0,388218.0
5,"your linguistics grad department,",388219.0,389749.0
5,find people who speak different,389750.0,390468.0
5,languages and ask them about their colour,390469.0,392329.0
5,terms and then they replicated that on a,392330.0,394038.0
5,larger scale by sending people out or,394039.0,396348.0
5,working with people who are already going out,396349.0,397939.0
5,and doing linguistic fieldwork and,397940.0,399679.0
5,"giving them the box of coloured chips, like",399680.0,402529.0
5,paint chips that you get in a store to,402530.0,404478.0
5,match your colours and giving them these,404479.0,406158.0
5,type written instructions which you can,406159.0,408079.0
5,"see, we'll link to those in the show notes if you",408080.0,409638.0
5,want to see the original instructions,409639.0,410658.0
5,that they send out to people L: and the,410659.0,412638.0
5,colour chips that they used,412639.0,413929.0
5,specifically known as Munsell chips,413930.0,415968.0
5,which doesn't sound very tasty but the,415969.0,418609.0
5,thing that's important about Munsell,418610.0,419809.0
5,chips is that they are produced with,419810.0,421338.0
5,incredibly,421339.0,421999.0
5,consistent colours so whatever is,422000.0,424189.0
5,Munsell color 42 is going to be exactly,424190.0,426799.0
5,the same across all of the Munsell,426800.0,428509.0
5,set,428510.0,429229.0
5,so you have this real consistency in,429230.0,430999.0
5,the colors they were questioning people,431000.0,432649.0
5,about across languages,432650.0,434419.0
5,G: yeah so they sent out people with all,434420.0,435799.0
5,these consistent colour chips and they asked them,435800.0,437539.0
5,okay can you get some people who speak,437540.0,439249.0
5,whatever language you're working with,439250.0,440599.0
5,to sort these chips by groups that all belong to,440600.0,443899.0
5,the same colour and by the most,443900.0,446029.0
5,basic colour terms. So in English terms you'd,446030.0,448489.0
5,be sorting out things like red and blue,448490.0,450499.0
5,and even pink but you wouldn't be,450500.0,452029.0
5,sorting out sky blue which is a color,452030.0,454249.0
5,term that has a literal word attached to,454250.0,456918.0
5,it or bright red vs. dark red. So they,456919.0,460159.0
5,were trying to get people to avoid using,460160.0,461839.0
5,extra descriptors and just use whatever,461840.0,463939.0
5,the most basic set of color terms was,463940.0,466309.0
5,that that language had L: So English has 11,466310.0,469399.0
5,"color terms I think. Let me see; red,",469400.0,472009.0
5,"green, yellow, blue, brown, purple, pink,",472010.0,474619.0
5,"orange, grey - I've only got up to nine, maybe",474620.0,477109.0
5,I meant 9 G: I think it has 11 L: I missed,477110.0,479569.0
5,black and white?! There we go! G: There we go!,479570.0,482209.0
5,"L: Black, white, red, green, yellow, blue, brown,",482210.0,484759.0
5,"pink, purple, orange, grey. That is actually",484760.0,487609.0
5,"cross linguistically quite a lot of words,",487610.0,489829.0
5,but we can make even broader,489830.0,491599.0
5,distinctions if we talk about light blue/,491600.0,494209.0
5,"dark blue, warm yellow/cool yellow, off",494210.0,497869.0
5,white - these kind of extra descriptors G: yeah,497870.0,500989.0
5,and there are a few languages that have,500990.0,502249.0
5,"more distinctions, Korean apparently has",502250.0,504709.0
5,a distinction between yellow and,504710.0,506959.0
5,"greenish-yellow,",506960.0,507589.0
5,I think kind of uncommon cross,507590.0,509719.0
5,"linguistically, but they do it. It's a",509720.0,511489.0
5,little bit weird the fact that English,511490.0,513348.0
5,has words for purple and violet which,513349.0,515299.0
5,generally people consider basically the,515300.0,517069.0
5,"same color, but we do have two quote unquote",517070.0,518899.0
5,basic colour terms for it L: yeah so there are,518900.0,520939.0
5,also a variety of terms like violet and,520940.0,523429.0
5,turquoise and colours that - sienna for,523430.0,526879.0
5,example - so these are considered to not,526880.0,528889.0
5,be basics because they're not part of,528890.0,531109.0
5,the basic vocabulary that is taught to,531110.0,533509.0
5,"children, they're more technical terms.",533510.0,535639.0
5,They're generally terms from a,535640.0,537949.0
5,specific thing so turquoise has that,537950.0,539929.0
5,colour because of the colour of turquoise,539930.0,541249.0
5,or amethyst you could say that's a nice,541250.0,543139.0
5,- I would never say that's a nice,543140.0,544849.0
5,amethyst sweater but if if you wanted to,544850.0,547579.0
5,"you could, it would be grammatical but",547580.0,549019.0
5,it's an extension of the meaning of the,549020.0,550849.0
5,colour purple from that stone and,550850.0,553429.0
5,it's a sub color within,553430.0,555599.0
5,purple G: but if you look back,555600.0,557309.0
5,historically some words that we now,557310.0,559379.0
5,consider basic English colours at one,559380.0,562078.0
5,point were words that were used to refer,562079.0,564539.0
5,to a specific object. I'm harping on,564540.0,566338.0
5,pink a lot but the word pink originally,566339.0,568318.0
5,"meant a particular type of flower, a kind of",568319.0,569818.0
5,a carnation and was later extended,569819.0,572489.0
5,to mean the colour. The word orange,572490.0,575008.0
5,started out as the fruit and then became,575009.0,577859.0
5,the word for the colour. Even like a word,577860.0,580018.0
5,like black in English which is a very,580019.0,581638.0
5,basic color term originally come from a,581639.0,583559.0
5,Proto-Indo-European word meaning 'burnt' so,583560.0,586229.0
5,you can make these etymological links. I,586230.0,588508.0
5,guess it's when speakers become,588509.0,589948.0
5,unaware of the etymological links,589949.0,591958.0
5,that they really become basic colour terms.,591959.0,593398.0
5,L: It blew my mind in undergrad when I learnt,593399.0,595799.0
5,that black is historically cognate,595800.0,597989.0
5,with a lot of the European terms for,597990.0,600448.0
5,white,600449.0,601229.0
5,so in other germanic languages you have,601230.0,602638.0
5,"something like German 'shwartz', which I",602639.0,604349.0
5,"definitely didn't say right, and then in",604350.0,606599.0
5,"all the Italian, French, Spanish languages",606600.0,610409.0
5,you have was like bianca blanc or,610410.0,613169.0
5,something like that which is cognate,613170.0,615388.0
5,with black because black means something that's,615389.0,617939.0
5,like burnt or brightly lit G: burnt up versus,617940.0,622229.0
5,"burning brightly L: burnt up, there you go.",622230.0,624659.0
5,So these terms can change and evolve,624660.0,627148.0
5,"G: English also has words blank and blanch, bleach,",627149.0,630088.0
5,which all come from the same,630089.0,632969.0
5,route but refer more to the like we're removing,632970.0,634828.0
5,of colour than the the darkening of,634829.0,636688.0
5,"something, so that's the connection there.",636689.0,638309.0
5,"And this is one of the things, so what this Kay and",638310.0,640739.0
5,Berlin colours survey found is that,640740.0,643349.0
5,languages differ with how many basic,643350.0,645539.0
5,"colour terms they have, somewhere between",645540.0,647008.0
5,about 2 and about 12 and that they need,647009.0,650729.0
5,to follow at least an approximate,650730.0,652559.0
5,trajectory. They have a specified quite a,652560.0,654958.0
5,specific path but later research has,654959.0,656698.0
5,shown that there are a few more,656699.0,658078.0
5,divergences then they noticed. So if a,658079.0,660958.0
5,language only has two colour terms,660959.0,662938.0
5,they're going to have terms for light,662939.0,665159.0
5,and dark L: I mean it's hard to,665160.0,667379.0
5,imagine as an English speaker speaking a,667380.0,669958.0
5,language that only has two colour terms.,669959.0,671879.0
5,Generally they cover a pretty broad,671880.0,673828.0
5,"spectrum, so it's not just dark and light",673829.0,676739.0
5,it's like the dark and cool colours and,676740.0,678958.0
5,these are the light and warm colours.,678959.0,681359.0
5,But that's your most minimal set of,681360.0,683398.0
5,colour terms G: yeah and then if you get an,683399.0,685979.0
5,"additional colour term in that, number",685980.0,687509.0
5,"three, you're going to end up with kind",687510.0,689249.0
5,of the,689250.0,689549.0
5,"red spectrum, all of the stuff around red",689550.0,692009.0
5,so now you have light and dark and red,692010.0,693809.0
5,as a distinct thing and then after that,693810.0,695909.0
5,things diverge a bit more. Sometimes people,695910.0,698369.0
5,fourth color is yellow sometimes it's a,698370.0,700679.0
5,green but those are yellows and,700680.0,702869.0
5,greens that also includes stuff like,702870.0,704429.0
5,blue because remember all the languages,704430.0,705778.0
5,don't split up green and blue but,705779.0,707429.0
5,probably mostly light blues because,707430.0,708659.0
5,your dark blues would still end up with,708660.0,710099.0
5,black in the dark spectrum L: And then once,710100.0,712139.0
5,you have green and yellow you generally have,712140.0,714268.0
5,blue after that brown follows and then,714269.0,717088.0
5,"stage 7 is purple, pink, orange, or grey.",717089.0,720659.0
5,so you get more and more sophisticated,720660.0,722489.0
5,and nuanced colour terms G: yeah you get finer,722490.0,725338.0
5,variations there but there's,725339.0,727588.0
5,language that only has three colour terms,727589.0,729359.0
5,"and those terms are turquoise, orange, and",729360.0,731458.0
5,pink,731459.0,731939.0
5,L: yeah because that's not covering a lot,731940.0,734069.0
5,I mean it might be covering a lot,734070.0,736409.0
5,of the colour space in your wardrobe,736410.0,738028.0
5,but not for all speakers G: no orange! turquoise yes.,738029.0,743518.0
5,L: so it's not surprising,743519.0,746278.0
5,that we we're talking about pink,746279.0,748349.0
5,and orange and these later stage colors in,748350.0,751109.0
5,English have really clear and relatively,751110.0,753148.0
5,recent etymologies compared to something,753149.0,755009.0
5,like red or green or white but I,755010.0,758219.0
5,remember when I learned this stuff in,758220.0,760049.0
5,undergrad a friend who I was doing this,760050.0,762059.0
5,"with was completely, she just would not",762060.0,764338.0
5,"believe that you could cover brown,",764339.0,766229.0
5,"purple, and grey in one colour. She was just",766230.0,770458.0
5,like how could you have one lexeme,770459.0,772199.0
5,or one word covers all of,772200.0,774208.0
5,those three and then one day she came to,774209.0,777569.0
5,class and she was so excited and was just,777570.0,779458.0
5,like look look at the scarf that I,779459.0,781379.0
5,"bought and it was true you couldn't tell,",781380.0,783328.0
5,in certain contexts it looked brown and,783329.0,785729.0
5,some context it looked purple and in,785730.0,787349.0
5,some contexts it looked grey and that,787350.0,789449.0
5,was her like theoretical proof those,789450.0,792028.0
5,colours were close enough that it made sense,792029.0,793708.0
5,to put them in one lexeme G: well the,793709.0,795869.0
5,scarf actually brings us into an,795870.0,797219.0
5,interesting point about why languages,797220.0,800159.0
5,developed colour terms which is that,800160.0,802019.0
5,there's often some relationship between,802020.0,803969.0
5,produced goods whether that's dyed,803970.0,806609.0
5,fabrics or gemstones or other types of,806610.0,809759.0
5,processed goods that people make into,809760.0,813059.0
5,specific colours because if you're,813060.0,814739.0
5,thinking about the sky for example you,814740.0,816359.0
5,know we say all the time the sky is blue,816360.0,818458.0
5,but it's really not necessary to specify,818459.0,819898.0
5,"that the sky is blue, you can say the sky is",819899.0,821999.0
5,dark or light,822000.0,823019.0
5,the sky is cloudy or clear and if it's,823020.0,826079.0
5,clear and its light of course it's blue,826080.0,827879.0
5,what other colour is it going to be or you,827880.0,829739.0
5,can say something like the tree is,829740.0,831839.0
5,living or the tree is dying you don't,831840.0,833729.0
5,necessarily need to specify the tree is,833730.0,835259.0
5,is green or that it's red.,835260.0,836999.0
5,So a lot of colours in nature a lot of,837000.0,839939.0
5,things only really common one specific,839940.0,841679.0
5,colour.,841680.0,842399.0
5,Whereas once you start making cars you,842400.0,844889.0
5,don't say this car is ripe or it's not,844890.0,846929.0
5,"ripe, or this car is car is cloudy or",846930.0,849299.0
5,"it's clear, or this dress that you're",849300.0,851309.0
5,going to make is ripe or unripe or,851310.0,853169.0
5,that this basket that your,853170.0,856079.0
5,weaving is dyed a particular colour. Once,856080.0,858449.0
5,you start dying stuff in colours it,858450.0,860279.0
5,becomes more useful to talk about a,860280.0,862559.0
5,finer variations or if you send someone,862560.0,864749.0
5,to buy for you a particular thing in,864750.0,866669.0
5,particular colour may want to specify,866670.0,868079.0
5,exactly what that colours going be once you,868080.0,869909.0
5,start colouring stuff artificially L: so,869910.0,871709.0
5,certain technological innovations can,871710.0,874109.0
5,give rise to the necessity for finer,874110.0,876419.0
5,distinctions and colour terms G: And some,876420.0,878969.0
5,colour terms are etymologically linked,878970.0,881309.0
5,to specific things that created those,881310.0,882959.0
5,colours so purple is linked to the name,882960.0,885869.0
5,of the particular mollusk that was used,885870.0,888299.0
5,to make purple dye back around ancient,888300.0,890369.0
5,Greece L: so the original Berlin and Kay survey,890370.0,893639.0
5,has grown because it was really well,893640.0,896279.0
5,written as methodology and using the,896280.0,898799.0
5,Munsell chips meant that lots of people,898800.0,900509.0
5,could get these colour sets and go and,900510.0,902969.0
5,test with lots of different people,902970.0,904109.0
5,around the world and the world atlas of,904110.0,906599.0
5,language structures has a map about the,906600.0,909209.0
5,number of colour terms across a large,909210.0,912209.0
5,number of language they currently have,912210.0,913919.0
5,119 languages in WALS. I don't think,913920.0,916409.0
5,we've talked about WALS on the podcast yet,916410.0,918809.0
5,"somehow G: No, so WALS is an acronym for",918810.0,921599.0
5,the world atlas of linguistic structure,921600.0,924209.0
5,and it is a very cool website you can go,924210.0,926969.0
5,look at it yourself,926970.0,928169.0
5,"at wal dot info, we'll link to that in",928170.0,931259.0
5,the description and you can check out,931260.0,933629.0
5,all of these cool maps of different,933630.0,936509.0
5,linguistic features as dots on a,936510.0,939419.0
5,particular map so in this case you can,939420.0,941039.0
5,look at a map that has the red dots are,941040.0,943799.0
5,the languages with this many colour terms,943800.0,945749.0
5,and the yellow dots are languages with a,945750.0,947279.0
5,different number of colour terms and you,947280.0,948839.0
5,get kind of a view at a glance. I will say,948840.0,950909.0
5,WALS is great and it's a good resource it's,950910.0,953219.0
5,got often a couple hundred,953220.0,954689.0
5,languages for a particular feature,954690.0,956609.0
5,but it doesn't have all the languages,956610.0,958018.0
5,"there are like 6,000 languages and many",958019.0,960569.0
5,of them just don't have the kind of,960570.0,962278.0
5,grammars L: but it's as comprehensive as,962279.0,964139.0
5,we've got G: yeah many of them just don't have,964140.0,965729.0
5,the kind of grammars that can be used as,965730.0,967439.0
5,input to database like WALS so it's,967440.0,969239.0
5,very cool resource but it obviously over,969240.0,971729.0
5,represents the languages that we have a,971730.0,973919.0
5,grammatical descriptions of L: so there's,973920.0,975659.0
5,"lots of data on WALS for South American,",975660.0,977969.0
5,Central American and kind of central,977970.0,980338.0
5,West Africa and Australia and Papua New,980339.0,982528.0
5,Guinea for colour terms and interestingly,982529.0,984929.0
5,the lowest number of colour terms in a,984930.0,988109.0
5,language in the WALS survey is three,988110.0,989969.0
5,for basic colour terms and languages,989970.0,993028.0
5,with only three include Murinpatha in,993029.0,996268.0
5,"the Northern Territory of Australia, a",996269.0,998819.0
5,number of West African languages,998820.0,1000739.0
5,including Wobe and Dan and then,1000740.0,1003559.0
5,only one that I can see in Southern,1003560.0,1006109.0
5,America which is campus so I will put,1006110.0,1008659.0
5,the show notes you can have a click,1008660.0,1010099.0
5,around on the map and look at all the,1010100.0,1011719.0
5,languages and the distribution of,1011720.0,1013489.0
5,colour terms there G: I will say that on the one,1013490.0,1016099.0
5,hand it's very cool that the Kay and Berlin,1016100.0,1018409.0
5,survey has this very standardized side,1018410.0,1020419.0
5,of chips and does allow you to do these cross-linguistic,1020420.0,1022549.0
5,comparisons but when we were doing some,1022550.0,1024499.0
5,research for this episode I also came,1024500.0,1026119.0
5,across a paper that pointed out that it,1026120.0,1028099.0
5,can be also useful to look at the colour terms,1028100.0,1030349.0
5,for language in terms of how those,1030350.0,1032659.0
5,group use them specifically to refer to,1032660.0,1034548.0
5,"natural objects, sometimes this can",1034549.0,1036109.0
5,illuminate stuff that the very,1036110.0,1038088.0
5,standardized qualitative approach,1038089.0,1039349.0
5,doesn't illuminate. The example that they,1039350.0,1041328.0
5,had was there was a language that made a,1041329.0,1043639.0
5,distinction between light and dark,1043640.0,1046188.0
5,or black and white and then also,1046189.0,1048829.0
5,"between reddish-brown and pale green, you",1048830.0,1051889.0
5,think huh that's a bit of a weird,1051890.0,1053959.0
5,"distinction to make, maybe, but if you",1053960.0,1055759.0
5,look at how they actually use the words,1055760.0,1057319.0
5,the pale green group was for living,1057320.0,1061189.0
5,"growing things and often wet things,",1061190.0,1064519.0
5,and the reddish-brown group with for dry,1064520.0,1067548.0
5,or desiccated or dying things right.,1067549.0,1070879.0
5,so if you cut a stalk of bamboo off,1070880.0,1073729.0
5,and you saw that open that wet opening,1073730.0,1076279.0
5,of the like raw bamboo that was,1076280.0,1078798.0
5,considered that pale green colour even,1078799.0,1080329.0
5,though literally speaking it's brown,1080330.0,1081829.0
5,whereas if you have a dry leaf which,1081830.0,1083178.0
5,might be the same shade of brown that,1083179.0,1084799.0
5,considered the reddish brown colors so,1084800.0,1086779.0
5,there are pros and cons to doing a very,1086780.0,1088069.0
5,standardized approach I guess.,1088070.0,1089329.0
5,L: yep and one,1089330.0,1090139.0
5,think people have criticized it for is this,1090140.0,1091909.0
5,lack of cultural context and specific,1091910.0,1094369.0
5,conversational context.,1094370.0,1095839.0
5,Another thing that's worth talking about,1095840.0,1097069.0
5,in relation to colour terms and how,1097070.0,1099709.0
5,people use language to describe color is,1099710.0,1101959.0
5,that there aren't just differences across,1101960.0,1103429.0
5,languages there are also some,1103430.0,1104809.0
5,differences within language with,1104810.0,1106849.0
5,different groups and there's been a,1106850.0,1108619.0
5,variety of studies looking at this but,1108620.0,1110629.0
5,we just thought we's talked about some of,1110630.0,1111799.0
5,the ones we know and find interesting,1111800.0,1114499.0
5,and worth talking about. Some of the first,1114500.0,1116719.0
5,effects that we see is an effect of,1116720.0,1118639.0
5,gender and there's a really great study,1118640.0,1120649.0
5,here from 1977 by Elaine Ridge on,1120650.0,1123319.0
5,"sex-related differences in colour vocabulary,",1123320.0,1125239.0
5,in which she finds that there,1125240.0,1126859.0
5,is a difference between men and women in,1126860.0,1129589.0
5,terms of how large their colour,1129590.0,1131959.0
5,vocabularies are. Do you want to guess which,1131960.0,1133999.0
5,way that effect goes Gretchen? G: I think,1134000.0,1136219.0
5,if you're going to get me to guess that,1136220.0,1137269.0
5,"means you're setting me up for something,",1137270.0,1138409.0
5,so generally people assume that women,1138410.0,1140359.0
5,have a larger colour vocabulary,1140360.0,1141979.0
5,"than men, are you going to tell me that's",1141980.0,1143089.0
5,not the case? L: I'm going to tell you,1143090.0,1144379.0
5,it's the case in this study,1144380.0,1145579.0
5,but there are some other,1145580.0,1147769.0
5,factors involved as well. So in the,1147770.0,1150019.0
5,survey that the researcher did which,1150020.0,1152209.0
5,involved a set of 25 colour cards,1152210.0,1155029.0
5,I love it she used the Crayola 64,1155030.0,1157549.0
5,crayon colors,1157550.0,1158839.0
5,as her focal colours because,1158840.0,1161179.0
5,she wasn't using Munsell chips and then,1161180.0,1163399.0
5,she surveyed a variety of groups of,1163400.0,1165619.0
5,people and she found that women could,1165620.0,1167659.0
5,use more and more elaborate colour,1167660.0,1170149.0
5,vocabularies than men but there were,1170150.0,1171979.0
5,other complicated factors involved. So,1171980.0,1174439.0
5,for example there was a social class,1174440.0,1176209.0
5,difference and there's also an age,1176210.0,1178819.0
5,"difference, so younger men have larger",1178820.0,1180649.0
5,colour vocabularies than older men in,1180650.0,1182449.0
5,her study G: what was the social class,1182450.0,1184759.0
5,difference? L: the social class was,1184760.0,1186769.0
5,technical vs non technical jobs for,1186770.0,1189859.0
5,younger women in the demographic.,1189860.0,1192319.0
5,She doesn't actually define what,1192320.0,1193819.0
5,a technical job is as far as I can see,1193820.0,1195799.0
5,but there was a professional,1195800.0,1197929.0
5,distinction there. So one of her groups,1197930.0,1200599.0
5,that she studied were a group of,1200600.0,1202249.0
5,catholic nuns and these women did,1202250.0,1204169.0
5,score lower in the number of colour terms,1204170.0,1206239.0
5,they used than the other women in her,1206240.0,1208699.0
5,survey so even within languages there,1208700.0,1211879.0
5,are different factors that indicate how,1211880.0,1214669.0
5,many colour terms a person might use even,1214670.0,1216859.0
5,if the language has a variety of them,1216860.0,1219169.0
5,G: I came across the study of I think it was,1219170.0,1221299.0
5,women in Eastern Europe,1221300.0,1223239.0
5,the age effect that they found was the,1223240.0,1224799.0
5,"opposite, the older women had more",1224800.0,1226689.0
5,colour terms and specifically that the,1226690.0,1228399.0
5,older women have more colour terms,1228400.0,1229959.0
5,related to traditional dying methodology,1229960.0,1232419.0
5,"for textiles, whereas the younger",1232420.0,1234849.0
5,women had become disconnected from,1234850.0,1236739.0
5,traditional dyeing terminology for,1236740.0,1238269.0
5,textiles and could no longer identify,1238270.0,1240308.0
5,words like madder and russet and stuff,1240309.0,1244419.0
5,like this that are used in traditional,1244420.0,1245919.0
5,terms they tended to use more like,1245920.0,1248199.0
5,industrialised colour terms,1248200.0,1250269.0
5,There's the famous,1250270.0,1251889.0
5,London cab drivers study which shows,1251890.0,1254558.0
5,that people who have been driving cabs,1254559.0,1256959.0
5,in London for years and years and years,1256960.0,1258999.0
5,and learned all of the little byways in,1259000.0,1260739.0
5,London have developed a really,1260740.0,1262779.0
5,"good sense of direction for London,",1262780.0,1265539.0
5,they've got larger hippocampi to,1265540.0,1267219.0
5,give you directions and I think this,1267220.0,1269949.0
5,seems to be one of those like you,1269950.0,1271599.0
5,"if you use it you get more words for it, like with",1271600.0,1273879.0
5,any specialised domain,1273880.0,1275169.0
5,L: yeah there's a professional,1275170.0,1277509.0
5,vocabulary distinction to be made there,1277510.0,1279159.0
5,as well. I do remember reading something,1279160.0,1280749.0
5,and again we're into like,1280750.0,1282519.0
5,"uncited anec-data here, but I do",1282520.0,1284769.0
5,remember reading something that said,1284770.0,1286239.0
5,professionals can discriminate with more,1286240.0,1291159.0
5,"lexical items and words, like technical",1291160.0,1294308.0
5,"words, but it doesn't",1294309.0,1296139.0
5,necessarily mean they see more colors than people,1296140.0,1298899.0
5,who don't have these professional words,1298900.0,1301569.0
5,so you might give people colors and one,1301570.0,1304569.0
5,is magenta and one is russet and,1304570.0,1306909.0
5,"people might say well there within red,",1306910.0,1308439.0
5,and someone who does fabric work will,1308440.0,1311379.0
5,know that's magenta and that's russet,1311380.0,1312789.0
5,someone who doesn't have to discriminate,1312790.0,1315159.0
5,will be like well this one's rustier and,1315160.0,1317678.0
5,this one's richer red and so they can,1317679.0,1319869.0
5,still see the difference it's not like,1319870.0,1321399.0
5,not having the word and you know people,1321400.0,1323079.0
5,who I'm friends with in Nepal who,1323080.0,1325178.0
5,predominantly speak a language that,1325179.0,1326889.0
5,doesn't have a blue-green distinction,1326890.0,1328569.0
5,"still see the distinction, they still",1328570.0,1331029.0
5,prefer fabric in one colour over another,1331030.0,1333909.0
5,one so we're not saying anything about it,1333910.0,1336459.0
5,effecting the way people literally see,1336460.0,1338649.0
5,colour,1338650.0,1339279.0
5,I'm also going to put a link in the show,1339280.0,1340449.0
5,notes to Randall Munroe of XKCD colour,1340450.0,1343989.0
5,survey from 2010. Results relatively,1343990.0,1348189.0
5,similar to those found by Rich in the,1348190.0,1350769.0
5,seventies except he had a few more data,1350770.0,1353259.0
5,points. He had people labeling colors,1353260.0,1356249.0
5,on their computers so there's a monitor,1356250.0,1357989.0
5,"effect here, he had almost a quarter",1357990.0,1359939.0
5,of a million users logged on to label,1359940.0,1362129.0
5,five million colours. So a few more,1362130.0,1364679.0
5,data points there. There's more,1364680.0,1366689.0
5,distinction for some colours among people,1366690.0,1369989.0
5,who have identified in the survey as female,1369990.0,1371789.0
5,compared to those who identify as male a,1371790.0,1373889.0
5,similar focus on the same set of focus,1373890.0,1375839.0
5,colors though so you know everyone,1375840.0,1378209.0
5,agreed that red was red and pink was,1378210.0,1380189.0
5,pink in the most like brightest shades,1380190.0,1383159.0
5,of those and everyone agreed that no one,1383160.0,1385679.0
5,can spell 'fuchsia' so it was a pretty,1385680.0,1387719.0
5,successful study G: that's a good thing to,1387720.0,1389729.0
5,"be aware of, I can't spell fuchsia",1389730.0,1391799.0
5,L: I cannot spell fuchsia. So I'll put a link to,1391800.0,1395819.0
5,those note as well G: there's also been,1395820.0,1399149.0
5,an interesting post,1399150.0,1401579.0

5,"she's an editor at Merriam Webster, where they're",1403500.0,1405389.0
5,talking about the history of defining,1405390.0,1407999.0
5,colour terms in the dictionary because,1408000.0,1409889.0
5,"especially before we had computers, when",1409890.0,1412439.0
5,you're making a paper dictionary of,1412440.0,1414029.0
5,course it's going to be printed in black and white you,1414030.0,1415799.0
5,can't just define a colour the way an,1415800.0,1417479.0
5,interior designer might with like here's,1417480.0,1419129.0
5,your swatch you have to give some sort,1419130.0,1421079.0
5,of a description and for complex color,1421080.0,1423629.0
5,terms like fuchsia or magenta you know,1423630.0,1426539.0
5,sometimes this is easier to do you can,1426540.0,1427979.0
5,say it's a dark pink or you can say it's a,1427980.0,1429869.0
5,pinkish red or something like this,1429870.0,1431759.0
5,but for simple colour term you know,1431760.0,1433469.0
5,"how do you define 'red', that's a more",1433470.0,1435299.0
5,difficult task because you don't have,1435300.0,1436679.0
5,"basic there, so she has a post about the",1436680.0,1439109.0
5,history of coming up with either very,1439110.0,1440849.0

5,technical definitions and some of the,1443190.0,1444779.0
5,difficulties that editors at Merriam Webster,1444780.0,1446369.0
5,have come up with in terms of defining,1446370.0,1447659.0
5,colour terms L: there are another group of,1447660.0,1449999.0
5,people who have an effect when it comes,1450000.0,1452879.0
5,to learning language and those people,1452880.0,1454979.0
5,are children G: here's a fun experiment to do,1454980.0,1457259.0
5,if you have a child or you're near a child is,1457260.0,1459689.0
5,asking what some colours are because kids,1459690.0,1462569.0
5,are actually quite bad at colors a lot of,1462570.0,1465029.0
5,them are really terrible at them. So this,1465030.0,1467579.0
5,one paper that I was reading said by two,1467580.0,1469859.0
5,years children can generally learn a,1469860.0,1472739.0
5,highly imageable concrete noun from a,1472740.0,1476039.0
5,single exposure but they're still making,1476040.0,1478769.0
5,colour errors at age six. So colours are,1478770.0,1482579.0
5,not as easy to learn as 'this is,1482580.0,1485459.0
5,a dog' L: right so you can show them,1485460.0,1487678.0
5,something that they've,1487679.0,1489148.0
5,never seen before and be like 'hey kid,1489149.0,1491638.0
5,this is a blerg' G: and they'll learn the word,1491639.0,1494158.0
5,'blerg' L: and then two weeks later you can,1494159.0,1495868.0
5,be like 'go get that blerg for me' and they'll,1495869.0,1497758.0
5,know exactly what that is. But you,1497759.0,1499678.0
5,can say to a child what colours that very,1499679.0,1501838.0
5,purple looking dress over there and,1501839.0,1503579.0
5,they'll be like 'pink?' G: blue?!,1503580.0,1506518.0
5,yeah and they're aware that colour words,1506519.0,1508648.0
5,exist if you ask them to list how many,1508649.0,1510778.0
5,colour words they know they can list you,1510779.0,1512518.0
5,some that they then can't identify or can't,1512519.0,1515128.0
5,identify correctly so and this other,1515129.0,1517258.0
5,thing that the paper showed was,1517259.0,1518758.0
5,that they compared two populations of,1518759.0,1520978.0
5,"children, think it was one",1520979.0,1521998.0
5,english-speaking or western group of,1521999.0,1523528.0

5,instruction with a lot of exclusive,1525960.0,1527218.0
5,color terms and the other one with a,1527219.0,1528868.0
5,group of kids that weren't getting this,1528869.0,1530189.0
5,kind of instruction I forgot what,1530190.0,1531148.0
5,language they are speaking and they made,1531149.0,1533579.0
5,"the same number of errors at age six,",1533580.0,1535678.0
5,they were still having problems,1535679.0,1537028.0
5,regardless of whether they've been,1537029.0,1538079.0
5,getting like three years of intensive,1538080.0,1539939.0
5,instruction in colours in preschool,1539940.0,1542189.0
5,or whether they were not really getting,1542190.0,1543449.0
5,any colour instruction at all L: right,1543450.0,1545368.0
5,ok so children bad at colour G: which is,1545369.0,1548308.0
5,weird considering how good children are,1548309.0,1550768.0
5,a lot of other stuff in language L: yeah. I,1550769.0,1552838.0
5,did not know that is a thing I learnt,1552839.0,1554699.0
5,G: they're doing complicated verb tenses,1554700.0,1556288.0
5,before they're doing colours,1556289.0,1557728.0
5,L: well the other thing is even adults,1557729.0,1559378.0
5,sometimes disagree about colours if you,1559379.0,1561538.0
5,ever want to have some fun with adults,1561539.0,1563398.0
5,get an ambiguously coloured scarf or,1563399.0,1566368.0
5,something and ask people whether its,1566369.0,1568079.0
5,fuchsia or whether it's magenta or,1568080.0,1570658.0
5,whether it's maroon I'm sure I could,1570659.0,1572819.0
5,have had my friend tearing the,1572820.0,1574558.0
5,classroom apart with her grey-brown purple,1574559.0,1577258.0
5,scarf G: yeah yeah or whether something's turquoise,1577259.0,1579628.0
5,or teal or if it's turquoise is it more blue or,1579629.0,1582808.0
5,more green L: we have this problem in my,1582809.0,1584758.0
5,family because I have a dress that,1584759.0,1586709.0
5,"used to be my mother's, and my mother",1586710.0,1588358.0
5,constantly refers to 'the red dress',1588359.0,1590548.0
5,and my sister and I both know it as,1590549.0,1592888.0
5,the salmon or the pink dress,1592889.0,1594689.0
5,it's a very very rich pink but it is,1594690.0,1597418.0
5,definitely pink and it really weirds me,1597419.0,1599968.0
5,out because my mom is an art teacher,1599969.0,1601408.0
5,like i just feel like if someone should,1601409.0,1603868.0
5,be able to know the cutoff between red,1603869.0,1605878.0
5,and really dark pink... and I just wonder,1605879.0,1607858.0
5,are we seeing the world the same,1607859.0,1609628.0
5,"way, like where does her red stop? I need to",1609629.0,1611848.0
5,get a set of Munsell chips and test my,1611849.0,1613528.0
5,mother G: yeah you do,1613529.0,1614819.0
5,I mean but maybe she has a different cut off,1614820.0,1616319.0
5,"point for for where the colours are, like",1616320.0,1618328.0
5,people disagree about this stuff and I think,1618329.0,1620038.0
5,that this is one of the things that Corey,1620039.0,1621449.0
5,Stamper,1621450.0,1622168.0
5,noted in the dictionary post is that,1622169.0,1624118.0
5,even when you can pin down a bunch of,1624119.0,1626158.0
5,"descriptive terms for colour, some people",1626159.0,1627808.0
5,will disagree about is fuchsia,1627809.0,1629729.0
5,redder than magenta or is magenta,1629730.0,1631798.0
5,redder than fuschia,1631799.0,1632908.0
5,something like that L: yeah or my mom is,1632909.0,1634709.0
5,just wrong is the other obvious,1634710.0,1636748.0
5,possibility G: I mean she's your mother,1636749.0,1638729.0
5,"that makes her wrong, right?! L: it's a really nice",1638730.0,1641459.0
5,"dress, thanks for the dress mum G: but I",1641460.0,1643498.0
5,think these are legitimate areas where,1643499.0,1644758.0
5,people can disagree. One area where you can,1644759.0,1647459.0
5,see that English speakers have changed,1647460.0,1649709.0
5,our conceptions of what we think of as,1649710.0,1652138.0
5,belonging to specific colour boundaries,1652139.0,1654028.0
5,is in what we think of as red. So a lot,1654029.0,1657238.0
5,of people wonder why do we call,1657239.0,1659038.0
5,people redheads or why do we call hair red,1659039.0,1662699.0
5,when really this is an orange coloured hair and,1662700.0,1665128.0
5,the thing is is that there has been,1665129.0,1666748.0
5,English speakers with orange coloured,1666749.0,1669418.0
5,hair this particular coloured hair for,1669419.0,1671189.0
5,much longer than English has had a word,1671190.0,1673108.0
5,"for orange L: ahhh that's why that is G: yeah, so initially English",1673109.0,1677548.0
5,doesn't have a word for orange the word,1677549.0,1679168.0
5,for orange gets introduced somewhere in middle english but of,1679169.0,1681209.0
5,course when the first oranges,1681210.0,1683069.0
5,start arriving from warmer climates that,1683070.0,1686069.0
5,are from places that are not England,1686070.0,1688768.0
5,and up until that point there hadn't,1688769.0,1692189.0
5,been a word for the color and then when,1692190.0,1693868.0
5,the food gets introduced suddenly,1693869.0,1695099.0
5,there's this very salient thing in a,1695100.0,1696839.0
5,colour that is very specific. The,1696840.0,1698308.0
5,"anglo-saxons had a few words like yellow-red,",1698309.0,1700858.0
5,which was kind of a yellow red color,1700859.0,1703589.0
5,and saffron but they mostly talked about it,1703590.0,1706439.0
5,as red and the orange is responsible in,1706440.0,1709018.0
5,the introduction of that color and 'redhead',1709019.0,1710699.0
5,stuck around as a fossilised term from,1710700.0,1712888.0
5,before we needed a distinction between,1712889.0,1714358.0
5,those colours. And you might wonder well,1714359.0,1716278.0
5,why don't we use a different vegetable,1716279.0,1719969.0
5,that is also orange instead of oranges,1719970.0,1722308.0
5,surely oranges are kind of kind of far,1722309.0,1723959.0
5,removed from England but in fact if you,1723960.0,1725849.0
5,"think of other salient orange vegetables,",1725850.0,1727798.0
5,carrots for example originally came in a,1727799.0,1730288.0
5,bunch of colors so you could get carrots,1730289.0,1732178.0
5,"in purple , you could get carrots in yellow you",1732179.0,1734128.0
5,get carrots in orange and you can still,1734129.0,1735959.0
5,get these at a farmers market or,1735960.0,1737248.0
5,something but they're a bit more obscure,1737249.0,1738479.0
5,so they're not that useful as a,1738480.0,1739738.0
5,reference term for particular colour,1739739.0,1741898.0
5,because how do you know if you're talking,1741899.0,1742949.0
5,about purple you're talking about orange.,1742950.0,1744238.0
5,And pumpkins are a new world vegetable,1744239.0,1748138.0
5,they're from the Americas and so they,1748139.0,1750358.0
5,were introduced even later than the,1750359.0,1751558.0
5,orange was L: because orange has really,1751559.0,1753329.0
5,like it swept Europe you look at your,1753330.0,1755589.0
5,European languages and the word for the colour,1755590.0,1757928.0
5,orange is often the same as that fruit,1757929.0,1761168.0
5,and that's because when oranges,1761169.0,1762939.0
5,arrived people were really,1762940.0,1764109.0
5,like this is the thing with this color,1764110.0,1765939.0
5,that we haven't really lexically,1765940.0,1767678.0
5,pinned down in our languages before.,1767679.0,1769509.0
5,"Which really, it always does my head in",1769510.0,1771099.0
5,when I hear this because I just think of,1771100.0,1772599.0
5,oranges such a basic color,1772600.0,1774729.0
5,G: yeah it seems really basic to us but if you,1774730.0,1776739.0
5,think about what kinds of objects they,1776740.0,1778149.0
5,had around them and then you had kind of,1778150.0,1779769.0
5,yellow and brown that you can make,1779770.0,1781599.0
5,easily with plants dyes and there,1781600.0,1783788.0
5,weren't a lot of very orange objects so,1783789.0,1785979.0
5,might as well just lump them in with,1785980.0,1788109.0
5,"red L: we're not really going to touch on,",1788110.0,1789699.0
5,because you know there's so much to talk,1789700.0,1791229.0
5,"about with colour as a thing, we're not",1791230.0,1793359.0
5,even kind of touching on the metaphoric,1793360.0,1796028.0
5,extensions that people have for certain,1796029.0,1798189.0
5,colours or the cultural signifiers that,1798190.0,1801129.0
5,certain colours are used as across the,1801130.0,1803469.0
5,world but one thing I think it's fun to,1803470.0,1805359.0
5,talk about is the relationship between,1805360.0,1806709.0
5,colour and other senses. So this crops up,1806710.0,1810099.0
5,"in a number of things, one thing I want",1810100.0,1813459.0
5,to talk about is a recent study from De Valk,1813460.0,1815769.0
5,and a bunch of the team at the,1815770.0,1817749.0
5,"Meaning, Culture and Cognition lab in Radboud",1817750.0,1820658.0
5,University about the relationship,1820659.0,1822548.0
5,between colour and smells. And in this,1822549.0,1825278.0
5,"study they looked at Dutch, Thai, and Maniq",1825279.0,1828729.0
5,which is a language spoken by a small,1828730.0,1830769.0
5,hunter-gatherer community in Thailand so,1830770.0,1832808.0
5,they live in the same kind of similar,1832809.0,1834759.0
5,cultural context to other Thai speakers,1834760.0,1836678.0
5,but they speak a different language and,1836679.0,1838389.0
5,they live as hunter-gatherers and the,1838390.0,1840579.0
5,difference in how these groups described,1840580.0,1843038.0
5,odours has implications for the colours,1843039.0,1845739.0
5,that they associate with different,1845740.0,1847269.0
5,smells. And the thing I,1847270.0,1849219.0
5,love about this study is that to,1849220.0,1851949.0
5,distribute the odors they literally just,1851950.0,1854319.0
5,"put, so they had smells that were very",1854320.0,1856449.0
5,familiar to Dutch speakers and smells that,1856450.0,1858459.0
5,were very familiar to people from,1858460.0,1860079.0
5,Thailand whether they were Thai or Maniq,1860080.0,1862119.0
5,speakers so they had smells for things,1862120.0,1864908.0
5,like red wine or peanut butter or they,1864909.0,1867579.0
5,"had smells for things like coconut, or smells",1867580.0,1870849.0
5,that were familiar to both groups like,1870850.0,1872678.0
5,banana and they put these objects,1872679.0,1874569.0
5,they just literally put like a banana in,1874570.0,1876969.0
5,a spray bottle and then just,1876970.0,1878829.0
5,sprayed the smell under people's noses,1878830.0,1880148.0
5,it was a very lo-fi but very effective,1880149.0,1882908.0
5,G: like a spray bottle with with water or,1882909.0,1885579.0
5,just with air? L: just with air and a,1885580.0,1887889.0
5,banana,1887890.0,1888268.0
5,G: okay! This is great! L: and so like they repeated,1888269.0,1892678.0
5,the experiment with people twice and,1892679.0,1895048.0
5,they did things where they asked people to,1895049.0,1896518.0
5,describe the small and checked with,1896519.0,1898888.0
5,people saying if they knew what the smell was,1898889.0,1900658.0
5,like what the object was that they were,1900659.0,1902278.0
5,"smelling, so there were a few things and",1902279.0,1904199.0
5,what they found was that Dutch speakers,1904200.0,1905699.0
5,usually describe the odour by describing,1905700.0,1908069.0
5,"the object so they would say, if we",1908070.0,1910378.0
5,"have the banana in the bottle, they'd say",1910379.0,1912238.0
5,"'oh it smells like banana', whereas Thai/Maniq",1912239.0,1914218.0
5,speakers would use words that describe,1914219.0,1916678.0
5,the smell quality they wouldn't say it,1916679.0,1918598.0
5,smells like a banana and they'd say it smells really sweet,1918599.0,1920008.0
5,and when people described,1920009.0,1922738.0
5,"the odour with an object, so if they said",1922739.0,1924658.0
5,"oh that smells like a banana,",1924659.0,1926278.0
5,when they had to match the colours,1926279.0,1928319.0
5,"to the odors, so that bit was",1928320.0,1930508.0
5,"the final condition, they were asked to",1930509.0,1932158.0
5,"match colors to the odours, they found",1932159.0,1934678.0
5,that people who used the word for an,1934679.0,1937528.0
5,object to describe the smell would be,1937529.0,1939178.0
5,more likely to use a colour consistently,1939179.0,1941908.0
5,so if they smelt peanut butter and said,1941909.0,1943949.0
5,that smells like peanut butter,1943950.0,1945328.0
5,they'll be more likely to pick the colour,1945329.0,1946768.0
5,brown whereas if they smelt peanut butter and used,1946769.0,1949048.0
5,a term like that smelled musty then,1949049.0,1950908.0
5,they would be less likely to choose a,1950909.0,1952468.0
5,consistent colour G: So mustiness doesn't,1952469.0,1954748.0
5,necessarily have a consistent colour,1954749.0,1955918.0
5,"association, but we know what colour",1955919.0,1957838.0
5,peanuts are and they're pretty much,1957839.0,1958978.0
5,always the same colour L: yeah so their,1958979.0,1960898.0
5,finding suggests that the odour-colour,1960899.0,1963358.0
5,associations that people have are most,1963359.0,1965458.0
5,likely formed through language. It's,1965459.0,1967319.0
5,really neat article and they have a,1967320.0,1968578.0
5,great website kind of summarizing the,1968579.0,1970648.0
5,"findings, we'll put that in the show notes.",1970649.0,1972208.0
5,G: One thing that interests me about,1972209.0,1974248.0
5,colours and words together is the,1974249.0,1976708.0
5,phenomenon called synesthesia where you,1976709.0,1978298.0
5,have these relationships between,1978299.0,1979498.0
5,different senses and one of the most,1979499.0,1981958.0
5,common types of synesthesia is what's,1981959.0,1984118.0
5,called graphene colour synesthesia where,1984119.0,1986218.0
5,you associate certain graphemes - letters,1986219.0,1989098.0
5,and numbers and other types of symbolic,1989099.0,1991108.0
5,"shapes - with particular colours, and I have",1991109.0,1992968.0
5,"this kind of synesthesia, so it always",1992969.0,1994228.0
5,interests me when you find particular,1994229.0,1995578.0
5,research about this and this is not,1995579.0,1997348.0
5,unfortunately episode where we're going to,1997349.0,1998578.0
5,"talk about all kinds of synesthesia,",1998579.0,1999748.0
5,"because that'd be really cool we, should",1999749.0,2001098.0
5,"do one of those, but one thing that I",2001099.0,2002628.0
5,find is cool is that there's sometimes,2002629.0,2004518.0
5,a connection where the colours aren't,2004519.0,2006408.0
5,evenly distributed. So my particular set,2006409.0,2008778.0
5,of synesthesia is not the,2008779.0,2010278.0
5,rainbow is just sat down and there's the,2010279.0,2012319.0
5,alphabet sitting along it i have liked,2012320.0,2014268.0
5,more yellow letters then I do purple,2014269.0,2016908.0
5,letters for no particular reason.,2016909.0,2018978.0
5,L: So every letter of the alphabet has it,2018979.0,2021319.0
5,consistant,2021320.0,2021829.0
5,color mapping for you G: yeah and,2021830.0,2023959.0
5,all the numbers too and so a lot of,2023960.0,2026119.0
5,early synesthesia research is just,2026120.0,2028489.0
5,focused on establishing that these are,2028490.0,2030259.0
5,"consistent, if you bring synesthetes",2030260.0,2031939.0
5,into the lab and you ask them what colour,2031940.0,2033709.0
5,"each letter i,s in a year you bring them",2033710.0,2035239.0
5,back and ask them what colour each letter,2035240.0,2037009.0
5,"is, they'll give you the same answer,",2037010.0,2038719.0
5,whereas for synesthetes they'll be,2038720.0,2040668.0
5,a lot more variable. And this research I,2040669.0,2042949.0
5,find very boring because I already know,2042950.0,2044479.0
5,"that my colours are consistent,",2044480.0,2047689.0
5,"that they're there, because of course I'm",2047690.0,2049428.0
5,"experiencing them, but this is how you do",2049429.0,2051108.0
5,science I guess and the later research,2051109.0,2052848.0
5,has been trying to show kind of more,2052849.0,2054319.0
5,complex stuff about it.,2054320.0,2055579.0
5,So this is a specific topic I'd love to,2055580.0,2057168.0
5,see more people research,2057169.0,2058638.0
5,L: ok we'll do a synesthesia episode at one point one,2058639.0,2061908.0
5,G: well one way you can get kind of colour/ letter,2061909.0,2064459.0
5,effects even if you're not a synesthete is,2064460.0,2066979.0
5,"you can do what's called a Stroop test,",2066980.0,2069229.0
5,and what this is is that you take a word,2069230.0,2072378.0
5,like green and you write in a colour ink,2072379.0,2074989.0
5,that does not correspond to the actual,2074990.0,2077118.0
5,words so you write green with let's say,2077119.0,2079279.0
5,red ink and then you tell people okay you,2079280.0,2081529.0
5,need to read the colour of the ink not,2081530.0,2083989.0
5,the word and people find it really,2083990.0,2085759.0
5,difficult so you're seeing,2085760.0,2087499.0
5,green and letters but it's in red ink,2087500.0,2089509.0
5,and so you have to say red and we will,2089510.0,2091128.0
5,link to an example of a Stroop test that,2091129.0,2092959.0
5,you can take yourself and see how,2092960.0,2094398.0
5,challenging it is L: I am rubbish at them,2094399.0,2096739.0
5,G: yeah they're really hard because we get,2096740.0,2098329.0
5,so good at words. They've been used in,2098330.0,2100549.0
5,psycholinguistics literature for a bunch,2100550.0,2102799.0
5,of different things L: You can also fail at,2102800.0,2104389.0
5,a Stroop test and tell us how badly,2104390.0,2106009.0
5,you did through the link in the show,2106010.0,2107479.0
5,notes page,2107480.0,2108469.0
5,G: yes so this has been a lot of colour,2108470.0,2112819.0
5,research there are more cool studies out,2112820.0,2114949.0
5,"there, if you have a favorite colour study",2114950.0,2116659.0
5,or colour research or colour etymology do,2116660.0,2119659.0
5,"feel free to let us know L: or colour if,",2119660.0,2121429.0
5,you have a favorite colour! G: yeah! what's your,2121430.0,2123169.0

6,Mother Language Day in February and even,29259.0,32019.0
6,though it was a couple of weeks ago now,32020.0,33159.0
6,on February the 21st I think it's still,33160.0,35558.0
6,worth saying a belated 'Happy Mother,35559.0,37328.0
6,Language Day' to you Gretchen G: Happy,37329.0,39369.0
6,Mother Language Day to you! Which we are,39370.0,41139.0
6,"wishing in our of monther languages of English, which is",41140.0,42398.0
6,kind of boring L: both wishing it our mother,42399.0,44169.0
6,languages. Do you have any other heritage,44170.0,45849.0
6,languages that you wish to acknowledge? G: I,45850.0,47768.0
6,mean technically Scottish Gaelic is,47769.0,49238.0
6,probably a long time ago a mother,49239.0,51159.0
6,language for me but my ancestors were,51160.0,52689.0
6,lowland Scots so it's a really,52690.0,54908.0
6,long time ago L: well happy Scots Gaelic,54909.0,57069.0
6,day G: do you have any other? L: my grandmaternal,57070.0,59349.0
6,language is Polish and thanks to generally typical Australian,59350.0,64329.0
6,attitudes towards non-English speaking,64330.0,66669.0
6,in the 1960s that wasn't passed on to,66670.0,69219.0
6,any of my mother's generation at all so,69220.0,71859.0
6,yeah it's still a very recent part of,71860.0,74319.0
6,our family history. I'm the only,74320.0,75759.0
6,grandchild who ever learnt enough Polish,75760.0,77349.0
6,to speak with my grandmother in her,77350.0,79298.0
6,mother tongue G: oh that's cool L: which is cool I,79299.0,81609.0
6,wish I still spoke that much G: well I,81610.0,83618.0
6,"mean it's cool that you learned it, it's not",83619.0,84968.0
6,cool that no one else did L: it's probably,84969.0,87819.0
6,questionable how much Polish I remember,87820.0,89828.0
6,"today. And yeah, I always like to think of my nan",89829.0,92019.0
6,and my lack of opportunities to learn,92020.0,94148.0
6,Polish on February 21st. What do you been,94149.0,96669.0
6,up to or what's coming up? G: well by the,96670.0,98529.0
6,time this episode goes out I will have,98530.0,100629.0
6,been to South by Southwest where I will,100630.0,102459.0
6,have done a panel with Erin Mckean and,102460.0,104379.0
6,Jane Solomon and Ben Zimmer L: how are you not going to,104380.0,106658.0
6,like die of fangirling at people?! G: Because I've,106659.0,110319.0
6,already met all of them anyway? L: awwww I'm so jelly,110320.0,114008.0
6,G: but they're really cool and I'm really,114009.0,115629.0
6,"excited to be on a panel with them, we're",115630.0,117429.0
6,"going to be talking about 'word curation,",117430.0,119739.0
6,"dictionaries, tech, and the future' which",119740.0,122648.0
6,will happen by the time you guys get,122649.0,124178.0
6,this episode so you can check out the,124179.0,126038.0
6,hashtag that I'm sure will have action,126039.0,127898.0
6,on it and we'll link to that in the show,127899.0,129879.0
6,notes L: I'm really excited for,129880.0,132309.0
6,that panel I'm looking forward to it,132310.0,133689.0
6,hopefully - is it going to be,133690.0,134799.0
6,recorded? Am I going to be able to see it,134800.0,136719.0
6,as a non South by Southwest attendee? G: I,136720.0,139119.0
6,think there's going to be an audio,139120.0,141699.0
6,recording on soundcloud that South by,141700.0,144669.0
6,Southwest is going to put up online,144670.0,145899.0
6,because they've done that for previous,145900.0,147579.0
6,years. So I can't,147580.0,148899.0
6,promise that they'll do that again but,148900.0,150848.0
6,they seem to like doing it in previous,150849.0,152679.0
6,"years, I don't know why they wouldn't do",152680.0,153878.0
6,it again so we'll link to that if we,153879.0,155109.0
6,"have it L: yay, excellent! [theme music]",155110.0,164559.0
6,so there's a problem when you learn to spell,164560.0,172208.0
6,"English, which is that it's really hard",172209.0,174969.0
6,to spell English L: it's really a lifelong,174970.0,177639.0
6,learning process as far as I'm concerned,177640.0,179169.0
6,G: it's a lifelong learning process. You,179170.0,181539.0
6,know some languages don't have,181540.0,182529.0
6,spelling bees because their spelling,182530.0,183789.0
6,systems are so consistent they don't,183790.0,185109.0
6,need them - we can only wish! So the,185110.0,187659.0
6,English spelling system is especially,187660.0,189279.0
6,"ridiculous, it's got silent letters, it's got",189280.0,191469.0
6,something around 14 vowels but only five,191470.0,194018.0
6,letters to write them in. My favorite,194019.0,195999.0
6,demonstration of this is there's a,196000.0,197649.0
6,phrase that has kind of all of the,197650.0,200139.0
6,English vowels you just recite,200140.0,201699.0
6,and the phrase goes - I have to have to say it in,201700.0,203859.0
6,a non-rhotic accent because it only,203860.0,205659.0
6,works that way - the phrase goes 'who would,205660.0,209048.0
6,"know aught of art must learn, act and",209049.0,215259.0
6,then take his ease'. And each of those,215260.0,219068.0
6,words has a different vowel in it L: cool! G: and,219069.0,221048.0
6,that's one way of remembering the vowels,221049.0,222399.0
6,L: that's a nifty sentence G: yeah but if you try,222400.0,224379.0
6,to write that down in English it's hard,224380.0,226449.0
6,L: with the English orthography that we,226450.0,228039.0
6,"have, or the English writing",228040.0,229539.0
6,system - orthography - that we have G: and,229540.0,231488.0
6,spelling systems are also inconsistent,231489.0,233649.0
6,across different languages even,233650.0,235119.0
6,languages that are consistent in themselves,235120.0,236919.0
6,are often inconsistent when you compare,236920.0,239169.0

6,it for the /x/ sound as in Spanish,255069.0,257409.0

6,language L: there's a really great tumblr,261760.0,263859.0
6,post that kind of encapsulates this,263860.0,265659.0
6,variety in the ways different alphabets,265660.0,268538.0
6,that are based on the same alphabet,268539.0,269649.0
6,English is based on use their,269650.0,271509.0
6,orthographies in different ways which,271510.0,273219.0
6,we'll link to. When I first read this I,273220.0,275049.0
6,was like oh look someone's just posting,275050.0,276559.0
6,"in Norwegian or Danish or something,",276560.0,278769.0
6,but then if you sit there and read it,278770.0,280299.0
6,and you know the orthographic,280300.0,281859.0
6,conventions in different languages it,281860.0,283659.0
6,says something along the lines of 'I,283660.0,285249.0
6,wonder if English speakers will notice,285250.0,286959.0

6,using the spelling conventions of my,289389.0,291668.0
6,language' G: and yeah a whole bunch of,291669.0,293019.0
6,people have certain different versions,293020.0,294309.0
6,of it there's a Finnish one which is,294310.0,295719.0
6,"pretty good, there's an Irish one which",295720.0,297219.0
6,is fantastic,297220.0,298029.0
6,L: it's good because once you know what the,298030.0,299409.0
6,phrase is that gives you a feel for what,299410.0,301209.0
6,the conventions are in different,301210.0,302439.0
6,languages and for example I found the,302440.0,304299.0
6,Polish one really easy to read and then,304300.0,306339.0
6,for some of the others I was just,306340.0,307479.0
6,basically guessing because I knew what,307480.0,309309.0
6,"the sentence was, and it really nicely",309310.0,311829.0
6,illustrates this problem that we have,311830.0,313749.0

6,conventions for different languages G: and,315820.0,317739.0
6,we're not the first people to have,317740.0,319569.0
6,noticed this problem in fact people have,319570.0,321639.0
6,been realizing this problem for quite a,321640.0,323799.0
6,long time as long as people have been,323800.0,325569.0
6,writing with different systems and it,325570.0,327369.0
6,just became especially apparent as,327370.0,328989.0
6,writing systems became standardised in the,328990.0,332319.0
6,1700s and 1800s when dictionaries are,332320.0,334899.0
6,becoming popular and people were,334900.0,336639.0
6,starting to write in a standardised sort,336640.0,337959.0
6,of way and looking at other languages,337960.0,339579.0
6,and realising that they're,339580.0,340569.0
6,standardisations were converging on,340570.0,342009.0
6,something different L: I really love that,342010.0,343119.0
6,historically there,343120.0,344949.0
6,"was no consistent spelling conventions,",344950.0,347499.0
6,and so in Old English text we actually,347500.0,350289.0
6,have a good idea of the different common,350290.0,353139.0
6,literate dialects of people who,353140.0,355479.0
6,lived in Mercia or people who live in,355480.0,357159.0
6,Cumbria and because of the way that they,357160.0,359739.0
6,wrote English really reflected the way,359740.0,362049.0
6,"their accent worked, and once spelling",362050.0,363849.0
6,systems became standardized that stopped,363850.0,365649.0
6,being the case G: and it also became,365650.0,367359.0
6,really difficult people for who are trying,367360.0,368619.0
6,to learn English because even if you,368620.0,370659.0
6,"learn the spelling systems, when you",370660.0,372069.0
6,pronounce the words the way they look,372070.0,373809.0
6,and people look at you like 'that's not,373810.0,375909.0
6,actually how it's pronounced' and you're like,375910.0,377019.0
6,'how was I supposed to remember that?',377020.0,378009.0
6,Various people came up with various,378010.0,379749.0
6,proposals for spelling reform for either,379750.0,382419.0
6,just like a more phonetic way of writing,382420.0,384729.0
6,"English in total, or for ways of",384730.0,386979.0
6,adapting English words so that it could,386980.0,388869.0
6,be used for specialised purposes like,388870.0,390219.0
6,"people who are learning the language,",390220.0,391269.0
6,or people who want to write down specific,391270.0,392829.0
6,things and annotate exactly how they're,392830.0,394479.0
6,said L: and some people went for massive,394480.0,396279.0
6,"'let's create an entirely new alphabet',",396280.0,398169.0
6,some people just wanted some small,398170.0,399669.0
6,reforms. So Noah Webster is probably one,399670.0,402159.0
6,of the people who had the most,402160.0,403299.0
6,impressive effect on English especially,403300.0,405399.0
6,"on American English, so it was Webster",405400.0,407349.0
6,who decided to take and consistently use,407350.0,409659.0
6,conventions like 'i-z-e' instead of,409660.0,411819.0
6,'i-s-e' and using words like colour without,411820.0,414129.0
6,the 'u' instead of with the 'u' as,414130.0,416049.0
6,part of this attempt to make English,416050.0,418029.0
6,spelling more realistically reflect the,418030.0,420369.0
6,language that was being spoken G: yeah,420370.0,422079.0
6,there were other British reformers,422080.0,424599.0
6,"that were trying to do this, so there was",424600.0,426729.0
6,a guy named Henry Sweet who came up with,426730.0,428769.0
6,an alphabet called the Romic /ɹomɪk/ alphabet or,428770.0,431079.0
6,the Romic /ɹɑmɪk/,431080.0,431799.0
6,"alphabet, I'm not actually sure how to",431800.0,433029.0
6,"pronounce the name of this alphabet,",433030.0,434439.0
6,which... L: if only was written down some where,434440.0,437529.0
6,in a consistently pronounceable script! G: if only!,437530.0,440109.0
6,He didn't seem to actually write the,440110.0,442929.0
6,name of his own alphabet anywhere in,442930.0,444908.0
6,a consistent script so that's a shame.,444909.0,446799.0
6,And that was based on mostly Roman,446800.0,450728.0
6,letters but with adaptations for sounds,450729.0,452859.0
6,that English had and Latin hadn't. And,452860.0,454839.0
6,then there was Alexander Ellis who was,454840.0,457359.0
6,apparently the real-life origin of Henry,457360.0,459939.0
6,Higgins from 'My Fair Lady' L: Really?! G: I don't,459940.0,462219.0
6,know that's what Wikipedia says L: ok,462220.0,463538.0
6,because I'm going to invoke the,463539.0,465189.0
6,"supremacy of David Crystal, if that's",465190.0,468038.0
6,okay. I don't know if Crystal officially,468039.0,469658.0
6,"trumps Wikipedia, but in his book called",469659.0,471968.0
6,'Wordsmiths and Warriors' he says if,471969.0,473888.0
6,Higgins is anyone it has to be Daniel,473889.0,476288.0
6,Jones who is a phonetician who is very,476289.0,479228.0
6,influential in terms of like codifying,479229.0,481209.0
6,"the vowel system, so what we think of is",481210.0,483519.0
6,the modern International Phonetic,483520.0,484809.0
6,Alphabet vowel space kind of started,484810.0,486908.0
6,with Daniel Jones' cardinal vowels G: I,486909.0,489218.0
6,mean I don't know it could have been a,489219.0,491168.0
6,composite or something L: I think to be,491169.0,492999.0
6,"honest that the most likely is it's,",493000.0,494948.0
6,there was a genre of gentleman academic,494949.0,498129.0
6,at the time who's very interested in,498130.0,499839.0
6,these topics and there was a lot of work,499840.0,502119.0
6,being invested in generating some kind,502120.0,503918.0
6,of writing system that accurately,503919.0,505778.0
6,reflected speech G: yeah and so they made,505779.0,508359.0
6,the International Phonetic Association,508360.0,510369.0
6,"in the late 1800s, which confusingly",510370.0,513129.0
6,"enough also has the acronym IPA, and they",513130.0,515528.0
6,had some meetings and they were like,515529.0,516908.0
6,yeah we need to come up with a system,516909.0,518708.0
6,for this L: so the IPA is where the IPA was,518709.0,521859.0
6,created G: yeah I hope they were all,521860.0,523749.0
6,drinking IPA but I can't guarantee,523750.0,525338.0
6,that L: in an our reenactment that,525339.0,528159.0
6,is definitely what's happening G: yeah when,528160.0,529929.0
6,we when we all get dressed up in,529930.0,531489.0
6,historic costume (bagsies Henry,531490.0,533169.0
6,"Sweet), then we will all drink IPA",533170.0,536169.0
6,L: I'm Daniel Jones apparently - no I'm,536170.0,538299.0
6,"going to dress up as Cardinal Vowel, I",538300.0,540398.0
6,always thought that would be a great,540399.0,541539.0
6,linguist costume G: ah that's great! Were,541540.0,543398.0
6,cardinal vowels invented yet? L: well it was,543399.0,545588.0
6,"Daniel Jones who did that, I don't know",545589.0,547599.0
6,when he was working G: oh ok good,547600.0,550028.0
6,L: I mean we'll have to have a whole episode,550029.0,551588.0
6,"just talking about vowels and how they work,",551589.0,553509.0
6,but that was kind of a thing that was,553510.0,555278.0
6,figured out at the time G: yeah and they,555279.0,556809.0
6,came up with some principles for future,556810.0,559929.0
6,development of this international,559930.0,561819.0
6,phonetic alphabet and these were; each,561820.0,564369.0
6,symbol should,564370.0,565648.0
6,have its own distinctive sound and the,565649.0,567898.0
6,same symbol should be used for the same sound,567899.0,570239.0
6,across all languages L: so instead of,570240.0,572159.0
6,having the J sound sounding like /dʒ/,572160.0,574979.0
6,or /ʒ/ or /j/ or /x/ across,574980.0,577979.0
6,"different languages, every time that",577980.0,579359.0
6,sound was used it would be used for,579360.0,580979.0
6,exactly the same sound G: every time that,580980.0,582659.0
6,symbol was used L: yes sorry every,582660.0,583979.0
6,time that symbol was used it would be,583980.0,585088.0
6,used for the same sound G: They also came up,585089.0,587128.0
6,with some principles that influenced,587129.0,589409.0
6,which symbols ended up being chosen for,589410.0,591928.0
6,which sounds. So they decided to use,591929.0,595799.0
6,as many ordinary Roman letters as,595800.0,598469.0
6,possible and to have a very minimal,598470.0,600958.0
6,number of new letters and to use what,600959.0,603299.0
6,they called quote unquote international,603300.0,605308.0
6,usage to decide the sound for each,605309.0,607498.0
6,"symbol L: so they wouldn't, the symbol that",607499.0,609208.0
6,we have for 's' they wouldn't decide 'oh,609209.0,611188.0
6,we're going to make that the sound for,611189.0,613519.0
6,'l' because we're crazy people' G: yeah,613520.0,615028.0
6,well they didn't do that but the other,615029.0,616229.0
6,"thing is, so look at the vowels, the IPA",616230.0,618479.0
6,vowels look kind of weird from an,618480.0,620849.0
6,English perspective. So the IPA uses the,620850.0,623489.0
6,letter that we think of as 'i' to,623490.0,625229.0
6,represent the 'ee' /i/ sound and uses the,625230.0,627178.0
6,letter we think of as 'e' to represent the,627179.0,629159.0
6,'eh' /e/ sound and so on. And this doesn't,629160.0,631979.0
6,"make sense for English, but it does make",631980.0,633808.0
6,sense when you look at a whole bunch of,633809.0,635758.0
6,"other languages like Spanish and Italian,",635759.0,637708.0
6,and the way the Roman alphabet has been,637709.0,639898.0
6,used for non European languages,639899.0,642719.0
6,generally falls along these principles,642720.0,644789.0
6,as well. So they said look even though,644790.0,647849.0
6,we're English speakers we're going to,647850.0,649138.0
6,not do the English things L: okay so they,649139.0,650729.0
6,really did go with this kind of,650730.0,651719.0
6,international general preference GL yeah I,651720.0,653909.0
6,"mean they're still eurocentric, they're",653910.0,655498.0
6,still starting with European languages,655499.0,656909.0
6,"and kind of working their way outwards,",656910.0,658258.0
6,but they were at least not,658259.0,660088.0
6,"completely anglo-centric, which is",660089.0,662308.0
6,"helpful here, because English does some",662309.0,663539.0
6,weird stuff with its sounds L: yeah so we only,663540.0,665188.0
6,"have 26 letters in the English alphabet,",665189.0,667588.0
6,a few more if we kind of pull everything,667589.0,669688.0
6,"that we have across European languages,",669689.0,672088.0
6,and there are so many more sounds that,672089.0,674338.0
6,"the world's languages can make, so once",674339.0,676469.0
6,we've run out of kind of standard,676470.0,677818.0
6,letters where do we go from there? G: so,677819.0,679409.0
6,where we are from there is often Greek,679410.0,682048.0
6,letters or latinised looking versions,682049.0,684118.0
6,of Greek letters because those were,684119.0,685409.0
6,familiar to these creators. Another thing,685410.0,687568.0
6,that they did was they would rotate,687569.0,689578.0
6,letters. and this was partly because the,689579.0,692128.0
6,shapes are still familiar if you do that,692129.0,693599.0
6,and partly because this is the 1800s and,693600.0,695969.0
6,people were typing with metal bits of,695970.0,698398.0
6,"type, and so",698399.0,699419.0
6,if you just make a lowercase 'e' and turn,699420.0,701939.0
6,it upside down you can just take your,701940.0,703589.0
6,new character and flip it and rotate it,703590.0,705779.0
6,and then you can print this and you,705780.0,707099.0
6,don't have to cast a new metal type,707100.0,709679.0
6,bit L: I have a really nice example from,709680.0,711689.0
6,"Australia, so I was at a workshop the",711690.0,713279.0
6,other day and a colleague was showing me,713280.0,714899.0
6,"a booklet of Kamilaroi, so it's a",714900.0,717509.0
6,language from the New England area of,717510.0,719489.0
6,"New South Wales in Australia, and William",719490.0,722249.0
6,Ridley was working on this language in,722250.0,723929.0
6,1856 so this is even before the IPA was,723930.0,727559.0
6,codified and so these languages have,727560.0,731639.0
6,a sound like an English sound but you,731640.0,733649.0
6,may not notice it in English because,733650.0,735269.0
6,it's a sound at the end of words like,735270.0,737099.0
6,"'sing' or 'bring', that /ŋ/ sound, but that",737100.0,740129.0
6,sound can occur anywhere so you can have,740130.0,741719.0
6,it at the start of the word as well as,741720.0,743369.0
6,at the end. So this /ŋ/ sound now has a,743370.0,746789.0
6,symbol in the IPA that looks like an 'n',746790.0,748979.0
6,with a little tail and it's called an 'engma',748980.0,750929.0
6,G: yeah kind of like an 'n' with a 'g' tail,750930.0,752969.0
6,"shoved on it L: yeah, and he is one of the",752970.0,755669.0
6,first people who adopted this symbol for,755670.0,758249.0
6,use in his describing languages work so,758250.0,761639.0
6,1850s before kind of 1880s and the IPA,761640.0,764729.0
6,"was established, but this symbol had",764730.0,766829.0
6,begun to be used for this /ŋ/ and it,766830.0,768479.0
6,makes sense because it's like an 'n' and a 'g',768480.0,770309.0
6,"squashed together, but when he sent it to",770310.0,772379.0
6,the typesetters for his booklet they,772380.0,775319.0
6,didn't have a /ŋ/ and so they just,775320.0,778289.0
6,turned a capital 'G' upside down which,778290.0,781529.0
6,sounds a bit crazy and it looks a bit,781530.0,783419.0
6,crazy it looks like it's just full of,783420.0,784679.0
6,"upside down 'G's, but it meant that that",784680.0,787799.0
6,was a way that they could represent this,787800.0,789029.0
6,/ŋ/ sound. Apparently he sent it to some,789030.0,790979.0
6,other journal in Europe and they just,790980.0,792539.0
6,"turned it all into a 'z' G: wow, a 'z'!",792540.0,794699.0
6,L: yeeeah G: wow that's really bad! yeah so I,794700.0,797849.0
6,guess that's why it's good that another,797850.0,800279.0
6,principle the IPA was the look of the,800280.0,802379.0
6,new letters should suggest the sound,802380.0,804269.0
6,"they represent, so once you've learned",804270.0,806189.0
6,the kind of basic ones and if you see a,806190.0,807809.0
6,couple languages and you have a sense of,807810.0,809099.0
6,what's used in other languages then you,809100.0,810779.0
6,can often guess fairly accurately what,810780.0,813149.0
6,"an IPA letter is going to be like, so",813150.0,814979.0
6,it's better to have a symbol for /ŋ/' that,814980.0,816749.0
6,looks like an 'n' and a 'g' shoved,816750.0,818999.0
6,together because that's how it's often,819000.0,820769.0
6,"written in different languages, a bit like an",820770.0,822329.0
6,"'n' sound, a bit like a 'g' sound. And one of",822330.0,824189.0
6,their principles was that diacritics,824190.0,825839.0
6,should be avoided where possible so,825840.0,827879.0
6,adding extra little like accent marks or,827880.0,830609.0
6,other types of small bits on top of,830610.0,832769.0
6,letters,832770.0,833189.0
6,was something that they tried to avoid,833190.0,834539.0
6,"for their basic sounds, and that was",834540.0,836369.0
6,supposed to be if there's a modified,836370.0,837719.0
6,"version of a sound, but not for like",837720.0,839459.0
6,basic sounds in general. So in the,839460.0,840869.0
6,current IPA you still get these rotated letters,840870.0,842609.0
6,which must make the IPA very difficult,842610.0,843959.0
6,"for people who are dyslexic, you get small",843960.0,845489.0
6,"capitals, you get Greek stuff like the",845490.0,847859.0
6,"Greek letter theta is used for the 'th' /θ/ sound,",847860.0,850739.0
6,and the runic and ultimately Icelandic,850740.0,854519.0
6,sound /ð/ so the symbol that looks like,854520.0,857159.0
6,an 'o' with kind of a cross above it that,857160.0,860039.0
6,is from Icelandic that used to be in,860040.0,862739.0
6,"English before the Normans came, that got",862740.0,864719.0
6,"borrowed back in, so borrowing from other",864720.0,866399.0
6,established systems because then you,866400.0,867959.0
6,could just go to Iceland and grab some,867960.0,869369.0
6,"of their metal type bits, I don't know, or",869370.0,871139.0
6,go to Greece and get some from them L: it's,871140.0,872789.0
6,something that was a problem with the,872790.0,873929.0
6,original metal type but it's also been a,873930.0,876869.0
6,problem for a long time with modern,876870.0,878639.0
6,software. So for a long time computers,878640.0,881039.0
6,didn't really have fonts that expanded,881040.0,883019.0
6,beyond the kind of really basic font set,883020.0,885629.0
6,of like English and French and some,885630.0,887849.0
6,diacritics and some special things and,887850.0,889679.0
6,so you have some older software and if,889680.0,892709.0
6,you look at older digital documents you,892710.0,894659.0
6,have you know people using capital 'A' for,894660.0,897389.0
6,"particular vowel sounds, vowel characters",897390.0,900089.0
6,in the IPA that are symbols in the IPA,900090.0,901949.0
6,that aren't in regular type or you know,901950.0,904889.0
6,schwa would be a capital 'E' for example,904890.0,907349.0
6,G: yeah you can even see this on some old,907350.0,909239.0
6,"websites, people will use a different",909240.0,911009.0
6,system that only uses the basic 26 plus,911010.0,914189.0
6,capitals to do the extra stuff or maybe,914190.0,916139.0
6,some places use like an 'at' sign @ to,916140.0,918449.0
6,"indicate a schwa, so because we've also",918450.0,921209.0
6,had a different version of this encoding,921210.0,922559.0
6,problem with technology L: so it's not,922560.0,924419.0
6,just the metal type it's also modern,924420.0,926339.0
6,computing G: it's also the byte! It's the type,926340.0,928289.0
6,and the byte! L: type and the byte have been a,928290.0,929909.0
6,"problem, it's getting better G: it's",929910.0,932099.0
6,"getting better thanks to Unicode,",932100.0,933509.0
6,thanks Unicode! So yeah so their first,933510.0,935579.0
6,version from 1887 was designed to work,935580.0,938219.0
6,"for sounds in English, French, and German",938220.0,940559.0
6,because that's what they were doing at,940560.0,942329.0
6,"the time, and it's a bit weird compared",942330.0,944999.0
6,to the modern IPA because we're used to,945000.0,947669.0
6,seeing it as a chart and they just gave a,947670.0,949949.0
6,list of symbols and keywords that stuff,949950.0,953099.0
6,"was found in in various languages, so",953100.0,955379.0
6,they'd say something like okay this 'a',955380.0,957119.0
6,symbol is going to be like the sound in,957120.0,958559.0
6,English 'father' or this symbol is going,958560.0,960719.0
6,to be like the sound in German 'Bach',960720.0,962338.0
6,and they just give the key words like,962339.0,963869.0
6,sometimes you see in the front of the,963870.0,964919.0
6,dictionary and then,964920.0,966139.0
6,"later, so they kept on working on it in",966140.0,967879.0
6,the late 1800s and then by the year 1900,967880.0,971179.0
6,"they expanded, published a version that",971180.0,973219.0
6,included Arabic and other languages,973220.0,975349.0
6,sounds were found in those and they,975350.0,976789.0
6,finally publish it as a table for the,976790.0,978979.0
6,first time L: so why would it be in it,978980.0,981169.0
6,"table, for people who aren't familiar",981170.0,982999.0
6,with the International Phonetic Alphabet?,983000.0,984709.0
6,"G: so the cool thing about the table, so our",984710.0,987889.0
6,English alphabet that you learn as,987890.0,989689.0
6,"a kid, 'ABCD' is in no particular order",989690.0,992539.0
6,"that's just the order it is, that's just",992540.0,994099.0
6,for historical reasons but the table is,994100.0,996349.0
6,ordered based on how the sounds are,996350.0,998749.0
6,produced. So sounds get produced with,998750.0,1001749.0
6,constriction in various parts of the,1001750.0,1003699.0
6,mouth and with different degrees of,1003700.0,1005589.0
6,constriction once you're in that place,1005590.0,1007269.0
6,L: so it's a nice feature based table of,1007270.0,1009879.0
6,all the kind of combination of features,1009880.0,1011799.0
6,in particular places G: yeah exactly and so,1011800.0,1014319.0
6,if you superimpose a mouth,1014320.0,1016209.0
6,"onto that table, it looks a bit weird",1016210.0,1019929.0
6,but you can kind of do it and you kind of,1019930.0,1021369.0
6,see where each of the sounds is produce a,1021370.0,1023949.0
6,little bit L: so it's the left edge of the,1023950.0,1025419.0
6,"table for people who are familiar, I",1025420.0,1027219.0
6,think i have a link somewhere to an,1027220.0,1028269.0
6,audible IPA chart so you can click,1028270.0,1030309.0
6,on the sounds and hear what they sound,1030310.0,1031749.0
6,"like, but the ones on the very left side",1031750.0,1033519.0
6,"are all produced with like just the lips,",1033520.0,1035588.0
6,"and the very front of the mouth, and then",1035589.0,1037299.0
6,the ones at the very right edge are,1037300.0,1038799.0
6,kind of all the way back at the far back,1038800.0,1040929.0
6,"of the mouth, and that's things like your",1040930.0,1042789.0
6,velar sounds like /g/ get made,1042790.0,1045759.0
6,with that soft bit there or your uvula like,1045760.0,1047919.0
6,right down in the very far back in the,1047920.0,1050199.0
6,mouth G: yeah so it goes from your lips to,1050200.0,1052269.0
6,like through your mouth along the roof of your,1052270.0,1054189.0
6,mouth and back into your throat,1054190.0,1055329.0
6,and the weird thing about this,1055330.0,1056769.0
6,version from 1900s is that it's a mirror,1056770.0,1058989.0
6,"image of that so it has 'p' and 'b', your",1058990.0,1061419.0
6,labial sounds on the right instead of on,1061420.0,1063219.0
6,the left L: oh no that would confuse me so much G: you,1063220.0,1065769.0
6,"can see an image of it on Wikipedia, it's",1065770.0,1067749.0
6,"all like typewritten, we'll link to that L: wow",1067750.0,1069249.0
6,awesome G: but it looks really,1069250.0,1071379.0
6,weird and they also have the vowel chart,1071380.0,1073539.0
6,and the consonant chart on the same chart,1073540.0,1075789.0
6,"L: right, okay! G: they just have like a really wide",1075790.0,1078309.0
6,"section where the vowels go L: how weird! G: yeah,",1078310.0,1081339.0
6,which is something that changed later,1081340.0,1082689.0
6,L: so there's now a table for the,1082690.0,1083829.0
6,"consonants, there's a few consonants that",1083830.0,1085449.0
6,"don't even fit, and then there's a vowel",1085450.0,1087249.0
6,"chart that's a separate thing, but it's",1087250.0,1088869.0
6,very similar principle like it starts at,1088870.0,1090489.0
6,the front of the mouth and goes back,1090490.0,1091869.0
6,G: yeah and what's cool is that the version,1091870.0,1094119.0
6,that we use today is actually very very,1094120.0,1095829.0
6,similar to the version that was,1095830.0,1097209.0
6,"solidified in 1932 it's which was quite a while ago,",1097210.0,1099909.0
6,you know there were some,1099910.0,1101469.0
6,adjustments made in 1989 and then,1101470.0,1103719.0
6,after that it's just like 'oh well we,1103720.0,1105339.0
6,need to add this one symbol because we,1105340.0,1106599.0
6,found some languages that use it' but,1106600.0,1108159.0
6,pretty much it stays very similar for,1108160.0,1109959.0
6,quite a long time once it's established,1109960.0,1111249.0
6,L: nice. So it goes from left to right all,1111250.0,1113649.0
6,"the different places in the mouth, and",1113650.0,1115419.0
6,then from top to bottom there are,1115420.0,1117159.0
6,different ways just looking at the,1117160.0,1118989.0
6,"consonants, the ways to pronounce",1118990.0,1120189.0
6,different consonants so you have like a,1120190.0,1121959.0
6,stop so the very plosive like,1121960.0,1124899.0
6,"/b/, /k/, /d/, /t/ - we call them stops - along one",1124900.0,1128619.0
6,"row and your nasal sounds so your /m/, /n/, /ŋ/ sounds",1128620.0,1132189.0
6,"along one row, and in that that way G: it",1132190.0,1134739.0
6,kind of goes in order of how much you,1134740.0,1136929.0
6,need to drop your jaw. So if you think,1136930.0,1138429.0
6,about the sounds in the top row your,1138430.0,1140949.0
6,mouth is the most closed when you're,1140950.0,1143049.0
6,making like a 'p' or a 'b' you have to,1143050.0,1145719.0
6,"literally close your mouth for a second,",1145720.0,1147129.0
6,"you have to close your lips to make those sounds,",1147130.0,1148269.0
6,whereas if you're making a sound like,1148270.0,1149769.0
6,'r' /ɹ/ you don't have to actually close,1149770.0,1151689.0
6,anything you're letting the sounds kind,1151690.0,1153669.0
6,of come through so the 'r' /ɹ/ sounds are,1153670.0,1155649.0
6,"near the bottom, but the /p, b/ sounds are near the top L: I",1155650.0,1158079.0
6,mean that's the thing I found super neat,1158080.0,1159789.0
6,about it when I was studying the IPA in,1159790.0,1161739.0
6,undergrad was just how elegantly it,1161740.0,1163449.0
6,captures all these different parameters,1163450.0,1164859.0
6,in one table G: yeah just to realize that,1164860.0,1167859.0
6,"someone has thought this through, thinking",1167860.0,1169869.0
6,'ok what are all the permutations you,1169870.0,1171519.0
6,could put your mouth in and which ones,1171520.0,1172929.0
6,people actually use and let's organize this',1172930.0,1175629.0
6,L: and English just uses one subset of it,1175630.0,1178299.0
6,"G: yeah, but every language is going to pick",1178300.0,1180729.0
6,some subset of the sounds in this table,1180730.0,1183129.0
6,or if it doesn't we have to add,1183130.0,1184029.0
6,something so one of the cool things that,1184030.0,1186099.0
6,you can do with the IPA because it's,1186100.0,1188829.0
6,based on different positions the mouth,1188830.0,1190809.0
6,can be in. So Lauren Ackerman who has a,1190810.0,1193089.0
6,blog 'Wug Life' has made a table of emoji,1193090.0,1197799.0
6,with their mouth positions as if they're,1197800.0,1200229.0
6,making sounds in the IPA so you could,1200230.0,1202479.0
6,look at this table and she has things,1202480.0,1203649.0
6,like you have surprised emoji has kind,1203650.0,1205479.0
6,of a round mouth and so that's like an,1205480.0,1207099.0
6,'oo' /u/ sound because you have to round your,1207100.0,1208749.0
6,lips for that and the 'ee' /i/ is kind of like,1208750.0,1210909.0
6,"a smile, and it is completely ludicrous but",1210910.0,1213939.0
6,also great L: these are the important things that,1213940.0,1215529.0
6,linguists do with their downtime G: yeah,1215530.0,1217929.0
6,and the other cool thing you can do with,1217930.0,1219789.0
6,the IPA is because you can use it to,1219790.0,1221889.0
6,represent mouth sound is you can write,1221890.0,1223869.0
6,"beatboxing in IPA, because beatboxing is",1223870.0,1226509.0
6,"done with the mouth L: oh yeah, that must look",1226510.0,1228129.0
6,amazing! G: it looks so cool I have a,1228130.0,1230469.0
6,"picture of it, of a chart that some",1230470.0,1232029.0
6,beatboxing linguist,1232030.0,1233349.0
6,researchers made L: that is awesome G: so we'll,1233350.0,1235178.0
6,link to that too G: I mean we both both,1235179.0,1237668.0
6,have a lot of love for the International,1237669.0,1239349.0
6,"Phonetic Alphabet, obviously it's",1239350.0,1240969.0
6,something we engage with a lot in all,1240970.0,1243339.0
6,variety of linguistic work. I think it's worth,1243340.0,1245319.0
6,"mentioning though that like, it's",1245320.0,1247058.0
6,not... it's really annoying sometimes. G: yes!,1247059.0,1249189.0
6,L: particularly as I mentioned in terms of,1249190.0,1251798.0
6,that font encoding on computers is,1251799.0,1254079.0
6,"still a problem, you still occasionally",1254080.0,1255759.0

6,single font G: yeah it can be hard to write,1268360.0,1270428.0
6,on a normal keyboard L: yeah it's also really annoying,1270429.0,1272109.0
6,to write on a normal keyboard sometimes.,1272110.0,1273879.0
6,"Also especially in the vowels, like I",1273880.0,1276788.0
6,get a bit of like IPA anxiety when I use,1276789.0,1279579.0
6,IPA and share it with people publicly,1279580.0,1281678.0
6,especially for long passages of,1281679.0,1283749.0
6,text it's not always that easy to,1283750.0,1286239.0
6,transcribe things G: yeah and as fluent,1286240.0,1288759.0

6,"I saying there, what sound am I saying",1299320.0,1301359.0
6,here' it can be hard to write extended,1301360.0,1303369.0
6,passages in IPA. I know if I make a blog,1303370.0,1305168.0
6,post that has an English sentence or two,1305169.0,1306939.0
6,"in IPA, I'll inevitably get some",1306940.0,1308619.0
6,corrections from a linguist or something,1308620.0,1310089.0
6,that says I think you're probably producing,1310090.0,1311558.0
6,this sound here and I'm like oh yeah,1311559.0,1312729.0
6,you're right because there's no spell,1312730.0,1313839.0
6,check for IPA L: yeah and also even if there,1313840.0,1315668.0
6,"were a spell check, you and I would",1315669.0,1317199.0
6,produce different IPA transcriptions for,1317200.0,1319719.0

6,lot of evolutionary practice at that but,1327340.0,1329109.0
6,reading things we have a fairly,1329110.0,1330879.0
6,standardised system and so I remember,1330880.0,1333069.0
6,when I was still a young linguist back,1333070.0,1335259.0
6,when John Wells's phonetic blog was,1335260.0,1337359.0
6,active and he's a well-known British,1337360.0,1339069.0
6,linguist who's involved in,1339070.0,1341139.0
6,some of the history of the IPA and he used,1341140.0,1343119.0
6,to keep a blog and he would sometimes,1343120.0,1344709.0
6,write full posts in IPA and they were,1344710.0,1347979.0
6,really interesting for me to read to,1347980.0,1349209.0
6,practice but I also found them very,1349210.0,1350859.0
6,difficult because he would be transcribing his,1350860.0,1352449.0
6,own accent and he was British and so he,1352450.0,1354729.0
6,wouldn't write all these 'r' /ɹ/ after,1354730.0,1356288.0
6,"vowels that I would, so I had to figure out",1356289.0,1358808.0
6,where all these /ɹ/ were supposed to be.,1358809.0,1361178.0
6,I'd end up reading his post out loud to,1361179.0,1363069.0
6,myself and hearing the British accent,1363070.0,1364808.0
6,being like oh yeah this is what he's,1364809.0,1366279.0
6,trying to say,1366280.0,1366879.0
6,L: you would be saying it in his accent? G: but,1366880.0,1368739.0
6,I'd be saying it in his accent because,1368740.0,1369939.0
6,"you can write someone's accent, which",1369940.0,1372099.0
6,is the cool thing but also the more,1372100.0,1373479.0
6,challenging thing about reading it L: there's,1373480.0,1374679.0
6,"also, linguists talk about like broad",1374680.0,1376269.0
6,IPA and narrow IPA transcription so like,1376270.0,1379449.0
6,"you can do a kind of rough-and-ready,",1379450.0,1381249.0
6,mostly correct but actually if you are a,1381250.0,1384069.0
6,phonetician and you're looking really,1384070.0,1385539.0
6,closely at how people actually,1385540.0,1387099.0
6,articulate things you discover all kinds,1387100.0,1390249.0
6,of things that you need to transcribe to,1390250.0,1392949.0
6,capture the correct and accurate,1392950.0,1394539.0
6,transcription but which people don't,1394540.0,1396849.0
6,hear kind of consciously or would find,1396850.0,1399249.0
6,really weird when you've represented it,1399250.0,1401319.0
6,to them G: yeah or don't notice L: and there's often,1401320.0,1403389.0
6,"like phonological processes, like when",1403390.0,1405189.0
6,you tell people that the vowel that they,1405190.0,1406959.0
6,"use in the middle of 'handbag' is actually,",1406960.0,1409059.0
6,for native speakers if they say it,1409060.0,1410349.0
6,"quickly, it often becomes 'hambag' G: 'hambag',",1410350.0,1412479.0
6,"like a ham sandwich L: yeah, like a bag-o-ham.",1412480.0,1415119.0
6,If you've write it out in IPA people are,1415120.0,1416979.0
6,"like that's incorrect, and you're like 'well that's",1416980.0,1418539.0
6,what you said' G: there's a fun story about,1418540.0,1420609.0
6,"that, so English speakers also often say",1420610.0,1422679.0
6,'sammich' instead of 'sandwich' because the,1422680.0,1425319.0
6,'m' the like the nasal sound becomes,1425320.0,1427509.0
6,like the 'w'. Except for Anglo-Italians; so,1427510.0,1431289.0
6,in Canada there's like Italian,1431290.0,1432729.0
6,Torontonians and Italian Montrealers,1432730.0,1434439.0
6,"and they have a particular, at least people who",1434440.0,1437049.0
6,grew up in that communities often have a,1437050.0,1438699.0
6,particular accent. So in that accent they,1438700.0,1441039.0
6,say 'sangwich' instead of sammich' because,1441040.0,1443949.0
6,in an Italian the 'w' sound is,1443950.0,1448179.0
6,kind of more velar whereas in,1448180.0,1450969.0
6,English it's more labial and so it,1450970.0,1452799.0
6,like pulls the nasal along with it to,1452800.0,1455229.0
6,be a different sound L: and when you start,1455230.0,1456339.0
6,transcribing things in really close IPA,1456340.0,1458259.0
6,"you can see those distinctions, it's really",1458260.0,1460539.0
6,cool G: yeah and we often just reduce the,1460540.0,1462789.0
6,vowels in words that were saying quickly,1462790.0,1464889.0
6,or in the small unimportant function,1464890.0,1466869.0
6,words we often reduce the vowels all,1466870.0,1468819.0
6,to schwa or something like that L: I still,1468820.0,1470169.0
6,remember in in my undergraduate class,1470170.0,1472209.0
6,learning that English vowels will,1472210.0,1474849.0
6,"often go to being this is schwa,",1474850.0,1477339.0
6,this /ə/ sound in unstressed syllables and,1477340.0,1480459.0
6,I just it made me realize that for a,1480460.0,1482979.0
6,certain set of words that's why I was,1482980.0,1485229.0
6,really bad at spelling them because you,1485230.0,1487479.0
6,sit there and you're like 'is it amu... amuni,1487480.0,1489009.0
6,"ammunition?'. Is it that, like is that I",1489010.0,1492339.0
6,mean is it ammunitiON or I mean is it ammunitiAN and it's,1492340.0,1494619.0
6,not a great word but it's the first one,1494620.0,1496059.0
6,that came to mind but like for these,1496060.0,1497829.0
6,"vowels where you're like, because it's unstressed and it's a",1497830.0,1500349.0
6,"schwa, any of the vowels that it could",1500350.0,1503259.0
6,"possibly be become that, you have to",1503260.0,1505029.0
6,memorize what the spelling is because,1505030.0,1506859.0
6,your pronunciation doesn't help you. And,1506860.0,1508839.0
6,that's why I tell people I'm bad at,1508840.0,1510548.0
6,"English spelling, not my fault it's the",1510549.0,1512469.0
6,fault of my stress system and orthography!,1512470.0,1514779.0
6,G: well the other thing is is sometimes,1514780.0,1516459.0
6,English orthography gives you useful,1516460.0,1518619.0
6,cues to distinguish between certain,1518620.0,1521469.0
6,words or when a suffix who's added sometimes,1521470.0,1524859.0
6,the stress changes and you have to,1524860.0,1526269.0
6,recover vowels that are kind of there,1526270.0,1528219.0
6,"but had turned into schwa, so if you",1528220.0,1530109.0
6,take a word like 'electric' which becomes,1530110.0,1531969.0
6,'electricity' in some senses it's weird,1531970.0,1534219.0
6,that it's spelled with a 'c' and not with,1534220.0,1536949.0
6,a 'k' or an 's' because 'c' is completely,1536950.0,1539798.0
6,"redundant, it always makes a different",1539799.0,1541418.0
6,sound but it does reflect that when it's,1541419.0,1543879.0
6,'electric' with the 'k' sound and then,1543880.0,1545889.0
6,"when you add an '-ity' to it, the 'k' sound",1545890.0,1548979.0
6,becomes an 's' sound because that's what,1548980.0,1550599.0
6,"happens with 'c', but it doesn't happen with",1550600.0,1552279.0
6,"'k' or the vowels also change 'electric',",1552280.0,1554949.0
6,'electricity' you get different sorts of vowels.,1554950.0,1557048.0
6,So it's kind of useful to have some of,1557049.0,1558879.0
6,this stuff there that was,1558880.0,1560288.0
6,historically there and has changed in it's,1560289.0,1561879.0
6,sound but it creates this extra layer of,1561880.0,1563168.0
6,"complication and it's you know, you can",1563169.0,1564759.0
6,get used to speed reading because a word,1564760.0,1567548.0
6,always looks like the same spelling,1567549.0,1569048.0
6,whereas if you had to speed read a whole,1569049.0,1570939.0
6,bunch of different accents then you'd,1570940.0,1572109.0
6,like meet someone and you might be,1572110.0,1573639.0
6,"harder to speed read,",1573640.0,1574808.0
6,but then again it's harder to learn it,1574809.0,1576099.0
6,if you have an accent that's less,1576100.0,1577239.0
6,similar to the spelling system L: we still love,1577240.0,1579158.0
6,it for all of the occasional detriments,1579159.0,1581319.0
6,that occur G: we still love it and it's,1581320.0,1583689.0
6,still useful to have it as an option to,1583690.0,1585489.0
6,write something very specifically I find,1585490.0,1587199.0
6,if I'm meeting somebody and I haven't,1587200.0,1589119.0
6,heard their name before and I can,1589120.0,1590949.0
6,write it in IPA and then I can pronounce,1590950.0,1592359.0
6,it correctly when I'm talking back to,1592360.0,1593469.0
6,"them, people like that L: that's handy. The journal",1593470.0,1595569.0
6,"of the Phonetic Association, or journal of",1595570.0,1597729.0
6,the International Phonetic,1597730.0,1598479.0
6,"Association, used to accept articles",1598480.0,1600788.0
6,"written in IPA, which blows my",1600789.0,1603548.0
6,mind. So people would write about some,1603549.0,1605829.0
6,feature of phonetics and they would do,1605830.0,1607658.0
6,the whole thing in the IPA and I think,1607659.0,1610209.0
6,it very quickly became apparent that,1610210.0,1611619.0
6,that was more labour both to produce and,1611620.0,1613959.0
6,to consume than it was like any,1613960.0,1616359.0
6,benefit in doing that for many of the,1616360.0,1618369.0
6,reasons that we've already mentioned,1618370.0,1619449.0
6,G: like 'hi I'm going to write about like,1619450.0,1622089.0
6,long vowels in Sussex' or something and,1622090.0,1625269.0
6,like that whole thing would be in IPA L: yes,1625270.0,1626949.0
6,I think academics clearly had more time on,1626950.0,1628689.0
6,their hands 50 years ago.,1628690.0,1632479.0
6,G: I mean to be fair I have played IPA,1632480.0,1634729.0
6,"Scrabble, which is like Scrabble, but you",1634730.0,1638119.0
6,do it in IPA L: you just kind of argue for your,1638120.0,1640219.0
6,own pronunciation or do you have to do it,1640220.0,1641869.0
6,in your own dialect? G: yeah so the way that,1641870.0,1644329.0
6,I've done it is I combined IPA Scrabble,1644330.0,1646789.0
6,"with descriptivist Scrabble, which is a",1646790.0,1648739.0
6,"little bit like those bluffing games,",1648740.0,1650449.0
6,so as long as you can convince other,1650450.0,1652729.0
6,people that it's a word then it's a word,1652730.0,1654139.0
6,L: ah I like that G: yeah because like,1654140.0,1655849.0
6,"dictionaries are arbitrary authorities anyway,",1655850.0,1657289.0
6,and so you know you can use whatever,1657290.0,1659298.0
6,means you have at your disposal to,1659299.0,1660678.0
6,convince people that it's a word and of,1660679.0,1662329.0
6,course choosing an obvious word like dog,1662330.0,1664579.0
6,or something is going to be easier to,1664580.0,1666019.0
6,convince people than saying L: blergh?,1666020.0,1667879.0
6,G: something.. blerg is a word and 'honestly,1667880.0,1670909.0
6,it means a color kind of like gray and,1670910.0,1673579.0
6,blue at the same time' but you can try!,1673580.0,1675619.0
6,L: there are heaps of cool things people have,1675620.0,1677389.0
6,done with the IPA including someone has,1677390.0,1680539.0
6,made a set of IPA Scrabble G: yeah so I,1680540.0,1683119.0
6,posted on All Things Linguistic a set of,1683120.0,1685579.0
6,frequencies and scores that you can use,1685580.0,1687379.0
6,for IPA Scrabble tiles because I made it,1687380.0,1689719.0
6,with a friend in undergrad and we had,1689720.0,1691308.0
6,"figured this out, we just cut out bits",1691309.0,1693139.0
6,"of cardboard to make them, and then some",1693140.0,1695509.0
6,undergrads at Yale came across this and,1695510.0,1698058.0
6,decided to get their friend who has like,1698059.0,1700069.0
6,a wood cutting machine to cut these out of,1700070.0,1702319.0
6,these gorgeous wood tiles and they sent me,1702320.0,1704058.0
6,"some photos which I've also posted, you",1704059.0,1705678.0
6,"can see those, they're amazing, so yeah so",1705679.0,1707869.0
6,someone has made a wooden IPA set that I,1707870.0,1709548.0
6,still have not played but I think it'd,1709549.0,1710689.0
6,be really cool L: IPA characters also make for,1710690.0,1713149.0
6,popular tattoos because they're quite,1713150.0,1715609.0
6,beautiful so I like I've definitely seen,1715610.0,1717349.0
6,a schwa tattoo and I've seen a glottal,1717350.0,1720109.0
6,stop which is a little bit like a,1720110.0,1722089.0
6,question mark - it's our logo! G: it is also,1722090.0,1724308.0
6,our logo. Do people get whole words in,1724309.0,1726319.0
6,IPA or like phrases in IPA tattooed on them? L: mmm I,1726320.0,1728298.0
6,haven't seen any but if anyone has we,1728299.0,1730639.0
6,will definitely be interested in seeing it,1730640.0,1732469.0
6,G: if you know any IPA tattoos please send them,1732470.0,1734779.0
6,to us L: well I've seen a couple but not that long,1734780.0,1736519.0

6,talking to the Mad Hatter and so on,1746570.0,1748189.0
6,and it's all in IPA. The weird thing about,1748190.0,1750109.0
6,this particular version is that this,1750110.0,1752119.0
6,publisher decided to also have capital,1752120.0,1755629.0
6,"letters L: huh, interesting G: and of course they",1755630.0,1757699.0
6,had to make capital versions for all of,1757700.0,1759889.0
6,the IPA letters L: wow that's commitment,1759890.0,1762139.0
6,G: because you know if you think about it,1762140.0,1764209.0
6,"capitals are redundant,",1764210.0,1765979.0
6,they don't add any extra phonetic,1765980.0,1767329.0
6,"information to a sound, so the IPA",1767330.0,1768979.0
6,doesn't use them and sometimes the IPA,1768980.0,1770689.0
6,uses small cap versions of a letter to,1770690.0,1773089.0
6,indicate a different sound because it's,1773090.0,1774619.0
6,an extra symbol. And so instead,1774620.0,1775999.0
6,"this person decided that no, if I'm",1776000.0,1777558.0
6,going to write it as a book I'm going to,1777559.0,1778548.0
6,make capitals and so yeah it's very,1778549.0,1779928.0
6,"interesting the table there L: yeah,",1779929.0,1781399.0
6,there you go. My IPA nerd craft activity,1781400.0,1784879.0
6,"was to cross stitch the consonant chart,",1784880.0,1786709.0
6,did that quite a few years ago and,1786710.0,1788749.0
6,it's a very useful adornment in the,1788750.0,1790609.0
6,office when you just need to quickly,1790610.0,1792229.0
6,"refer to some of the symbols. I also,",1792230.0,1795619.0
6,I was going to do the vowel chart,1795620.0,1797359.0
6,but the modern vowel chart is very very,1797360.0,1799249.0
6,complicated and messy which is why i,1799250.0,1800839.0
6,went with Jones's much more elegant,1800840.0,1802459.0
6,original cardinal vowel G: ahh so you did a simplified,1802460.0,1805459.0
6,version L: yep I'll put links to those in the,1805460.0,1807439.0
6,show notes G: and you also did a cookie,1807440.0,1809149.0
6,cutter right? L: oh yeah! I made a schwa cookie cutter,1809150.0,1810798.0
6,"for Christmas last year,",1810799.0,1813079.0
6,"just what you need, and it's a 3d",1813080.0,1815329.0
6,printable cookie cutter so you can also,1815330.0,1817308.0
6,download that design and print your own,1817309.0,1819229.0
6,and make your own gingerbread schwa or,1819230.0,1821659.0
6,shortbread schwas G: that's great. There's,1821660.0,1823909.0
6,"also an IPA version of the game 2048,",1823910.0,1826699.0
6,which came out when the when the game 2048 was,1826700.0,1829308.0
6,popular so that's the one where you like,1829309.0,1830389.0
6,slide the tiles around and you try to,1830390.0,1831589.0
6,combine to make bigger and bigger things,1831590.0,1833089.0
6,and so you start with a schwa and then,1833090.0,1835099.0
6,"you combine them to make an engma, which",1835100.0,1836928.0
6,"makes no sense phonetically, and then you",1836929.0,1838699.0
6,combine them to make an esh. Again so this,1838700.0,1841219.0
6,won't teach you anything about phonetics,1841220.0,1842479.0
6,L: but it goes into more and more elaborate,1842480.0,1843859.0
6,and less frequent forms G: yeah it does get,1843860.0,1847399.0
6,"to more and more elaborate stuff, like",1847400.0,1848719.0
6,you end up with like a click or,1848720.0,1850729.0
6,"something, a glottalised bilabial click or",1850730.0,1853428.0
6,"something like that L: right, it",1853429.0,1855079.0
6,doesn't officially teach you anything,1855080.0,1856189.0
6,about the IPA but it is a good excuse,1856190.0,1858048.0
6,for a distraction G: you should not do it,1858049.0,1860359.0
6,if you're a student and you're about to,1860360.0,1861918.0
6,write an exam on the IPA that is not a,1861919.0,1863539.0
6,good way to procrastinate L: official warning! G: instead you should,1863540.0,1866928.0
6,play IPA scrabble L: much better way! G: which,1866929.0,1869119.0
6,will teach you some more about the IPA,1869120.0,1870439.0
6,L: or read Alice in Wonderland G: there's also a fun,1870440.0,1872359.0
6,sketch from the sketch comedy show,1872360.0,1875359.0
6,"John Finnemore's Souvenir Programme, which is",1875360.0,1877189.0
6,a sketch where some characters encounter,1877190.0,1879499.0
6,some skeletons and the skeletons are,1879500.0,1881539.0
6,pirates but these skeletons cannot tell,1881540.0,1883668.0
6,you that there are pirates because they,1883669.0,1885319.0
6,"don't have any lips, so they cannot",1885320.0,1886369.0
6,"produce the 'p', sound so they call",1886370.0,1888499.0
6,"themselves 'kirates', L: Awww",1888500.0,1890869.0
6,G: and the characters,1890870.0,1893659.0
6,"who encounter them are very confused, like",1893660.0,1895129.0
6,"'what are you?' 'we're kirates, I said we're kirates!'. Anyway I am",1895130.0,1898699.0
6,probably not doing it justice but you,1898700.0,1900109.0
6,should listen to it I couldn't think to how,1900110.0,1901999.0
6,to do that L: excellent G: although they don't,1902000.0,1905058.0
6,make the point which I kept thinking was,1905059.0,1906589.0
6,"like 'well if the don't have any lips, they probably",1906590.0,1907939.0
6,"don't have any tongues either, so they probably",1907940.0,1909289.0
6,can't produce any sounds because they're skeletons',1909290.0,1911569.0
6,L: the probably don't have any kind of,1911570.0,1913459.0
6,pulmonic air flow ability G: like all they,1913460.0,1916129.0
6,"can do is clack L: yup, Morse code? G: yeah! So",1916130.0,1918769.0
6,skeletons can communicate with us in Morse,1918770.0,1920659.0
6,"code, there we go L: yeah. I was going to say",1920660.0,1922219.0
6,sign language just because like I seem,1922220.0,1924319.0
6,to want to mention sign languages,1924320.0,1925639.0
6,because they're always cool G: oh yeah please do,1925640.0,1927229.0
6,L: it's also worth pointing out that like,1927230.0,1929089.0
6,obviously the IPA is for all spoken,1929090.0,1931369.0
6,languages if you haven't figured that,1931370.0,1933109.0
6,"out by this point in the podcast, I'll just make",1933110.0,1935389.0
6,that abundantly clear. So for all oral,1935390.0,1938869.0
6,languages. In individual sign languages,1938870.0,1941419.0
6,people talk about like phonemes,1941420.0,1943339.0
6,and morphemes in terms of hand shapes so,1943340.0,1945589.0
6,there are some hand shapes that are,1945590.0,1947269.0
6,possible in some sign languages that,1947270.0,1949879.0
6,don't occur in others and so you have a,1949880.0,1951769.0
6,similar kind of basic feature sets that,1951770.0,1954229.0
6,you can refer to in in sign languages,1954230.0,1956419.0
6,but because it uses a more complex modal,1956420.0,1959539.0
6,articulation system and it isn't just,1959540.0,1961699.0
6,limited to the mouth then it's a bit,1961700.0,1963649.0
6,more complicated cross sign,1963650.0,1965029.0
6,linguistically but they do have their,1965030.0,1966979.0
6,own kind of equivalent of phonemes or,1966980.0,1969319.0
6,phonetics G: there's a couple different,1969320.0,1970909.0
6,standardised sign transcription,1970910.0,1973969.0
6,"systems, I don't know if any of them have",1973970.0,1975109.0
6,caught on at an international level in,1975110.0,1977359.0
6,"the same way to the IPA has, I mean to be fair",1977360.0,1979459.0
6,there there are other phonetic,1979460.0,1980569.0
6,"transcription systems that aren't the IPA,",1980570.0,1982009.0
6,it's just the IPA now has caught on more,1982010.0,1984558.0
6,than the others. But you can transcribe,1984559.0,1985939.0
6,"sign, there's a couple different ways of",1985940.0,1987259.0
6,"doing that and there's also, so sign",1987260.0,1989269.0
6,languages have alphabets that they use,1989270.0,1990829.0
6,to borrow words in from spoken languages,1990830.0,1992839.0
6,among other functions and there are sign,1992840.0,1995479.0
6,equivalence of at least some IPA,1995480.0,1997939.0
6,characters because I've been to,1997940.0,1999199.0
6,linguistics conferences and seeing,1999200.0,2000729.0
6,interpreters signing talks and they will,2000730.0,2003249.0
6,sign a particular IPA sound when the,2003250.0,2005259.0
6,person who's giving the presentation is,2005260.0,2006729.0
6,talking about that particular IPA symbol,2006730.0,2008289.0
6,L: there you go G: yeah I cannot recite any of them for you,2008290.0,2010749.0
6,"but I remember noticing it and thinking 'huh,",2010750.0,2011999.0

7,us to keep the show running in a,49450.0,50799.0
7,sustainable manner G: yeah and if you're,50800.0,52659.0
7,wondering if we can upgrade our mics or,52660.0,55509.0

7,an ad trying to sell you a web building,81369.0,83829.0
7,tool or something to eat or something to,83830.0,88449.0

7,yourself a language in three days',93460.0,94719.0
7,"courses, I think those would be really",94720.0,96069.0
7,reputable to associate ourselves with,96070.0,97359.0
7,L: definitely - we don't have to do that,97360.0,99849.0
7,though because we've set up the Patreon,99850.0,102339.0

7,month because we had zero listeners,226940.0,229929.0
7,"L: good sciencing Gretchen, good sciencing G: so just so no one",229930.0,232789.0
7,writes in to correct my maths!,232790.0,243878.0
7,L: we've already got to the punch line of,243879.0,246919.0
7,today's episode but we want to make sure,246920.0,249348.0
7,that you leave knowing full well that,249349.0,252229.0
7,kids are not ruining language. It's okay,252230.0,255828.0
7,everyone the kids are okay G: the kids are,255829.0,258469.0
7,"okay, the English language is okay, the",258470.0,260689.0
7,other languages are more or less okay,260690.0,263209.0
7,but if they aren't it's not the fall of,263210.0,264258.0
7,the kids. So one of the ways to put the,264259.0,267549.0
7,complaining about kids language,267550.0,270319.0
7,these days into some context is to look,270320.0,272149.0
7,historically at the types of things that,272150.0,274159.0
7,people used to complain about kids doing,274160.0,275839.0
7,and whether those came to pass and if so,275840.0,279559.0
7,whether everything was ruined - spoiler,279560.0,282379.0
7,the answer is no! L: because complaining,282380.0,283969.0
7,about the youth goes back a long way.,283970.0,286008.0
7,like it goes past the current generation,286009.0,288709.0
7,of people who are complaining about the,288710.0,291019.0
7,youth and goes back basically to the,291020.0,293059.0
7,beginning of written records in Western,293060.0,295939.0
7,history G: I imagine that people were,295940.0,298129.0
7,complaining with youth before written,298130.0,299569.0
7,history we just don't know about it L: yeah,299570.0,301249.0
7,and so one of the most early objectors,301250.0,303948.0
7,that we have record of complaining about,303949.0,306228.0
7,what the youth are up to these days is,306229.0,308569.0
7,"Socrates, who complained that all of this",308570.0,312168.0
7,newfangled technology called writing was,312169.0,315079.0
7,making people forgetful and lazy in,315080.0,317929.0
7,terms of learning things because they no,317930.0,319668.0
7,longer had to commit them to memory they,319669.0,321198.0
7,"could just read them G: those kids, they don't",321199.0,323119.0
7,recite Homer like they used to L: it,323120.0,325579.0
7,kind of reminds me of the anxiety,325580.0,327529.0
7,"around modern technology, when",327530.0,329869.0
7,parents are really concerned that,329870.0,331429.0
7,children aren't learning to maybe read,331430.0,334638.0
7,properly because they're reading on,334639.0,336079.0
7,screens instead of paper G: I mean now that,336080.0,338388.0
7,we have the Google who even remembers,338389.0,339829.0
7,anything L: mmm exactly we always blame the,339830.0,342649.0
7,technology G: but yeah Socrates was,342650.0,344239.0
7,saying the same thing about writing,344240.0,345619.0
7,at all L: which I kind of liked because all,345620.0,347629.0
7,of these people who worry about the youth,347630.0,349758.0
7,of today that they're not respecting,349759.0,351288.0
7,writing the way they used to it's like,351289.0,353059.0
7,well back in the day no one even,353060.0,355158.0
7,"respected writing, so you're not being",355159.0,357799.0
7,pedantic enough really G: and even post,357800.0,360288.0
7,Socrates there's a long period of not,360289.0,362809.0
7,very many people being literate L: yeah,362810.0,364609.0
7,exactly G: so this idea that everybody,364610.0,366109.0
7,writes is quite new and really specific,366110.0,368899.0
7,to a minority of the world's languages,368900.0,371749.0
7,today - they are the minority that have,371750.0,373339.0
7,the most speakers but many of the,373340.0,375679.0
7,"world's 7,000",375680.0,376739.0
7,languages get along quite well as a,376740.0,378749.0
7,purely oral and verbal mode without any,378750.0,382529.0
7,written kind of standard G: and I think,382530.0,385019.0
7,that when we think of languages that are,385020.0,386758.0
7,oral languages we also don't think so,386759.0,388978.0
7,much about how English also made a,388979.0,390388.0
7,transition from being a purely oral,390389.0,392189.0
7,language to being both written and oral,392190.0,393629.0
7,so that's something that happened in the,393630.0,395038.0
7,Middle Ages gradually with fits and,395039.0,397348.0
7,starts and there's not as much preserved,397349.0,399689.0
7,from the English oral tradition as there,399690.0,401249.0
7,"might be, I mean there's Beowulf, but",401250.0,402568.0
7,there's stuff we've lost there too,402569.0,404579.0
7,L: it would just be so great to have an,404580.0,406679.0
7,audio video documentary of Old English.,406680.0,410549.0
7,Someone needs to invent time travel G: this,410550.0,412318.0
7,is what I would do if I had time travel,412319.0,414388.0
7,is I would go back to all of these,414389.0,415799.0
7,different places and times and like,415800.0,418198.0
7,"document their languages, obviously L: that is",418199.0,420448.0
7,the first thing we'd do G: I mean if you can go way back,420449.0,422489.0
7,you could see if you could find the like,422490.0,424288.0
7,"hypothetical proto-world, like the",424289.0,426598.0
7,ancestor of all of the human languages,426599.0,428399.0
7,like was there just one? Were there,428400.0,429959.0
7,several languages? Can we go back,429960.0,431279.0
7,and find this? When was it? L: time travel is,431280.0,433379.0
7,really the only way that this is ever,433380.0,435179.0
7,going to get solved G: yeah so that's,435180.0,436709.0
7,"definitely my highest priority, and",436710.0,438329.0
7,then you could go back and find like,438330.0,439589.0
7,specific proto languages like,439590.0,441119.0
7,proto-indo-european L: I love that this,441120.0,444089.0
7,is like. top of your to-do list G: I have,444090.0,446758.0
7,thought this through! I have thought of,446759.0,448348.0
7,this before L: I love the like first,448349.0,451408.0
7,grant request after they've invented,451409.0,453569.0
7,time travel is you being like 'gonna,453570.0,456149.0
7,take my audio recorder let's go!' G: yeah! L: so,456150.0,458519.0
7,we can't go back that far to see what,458520.0,461008.0
7,people were complaining about the kids,461009.0,462478.0
7,doing but we can still go back pretty,462479.0,463978.0
7,"far in written records, and you have some",463979.0,466408.0
7,historical records right? G: yeah so in,466409.0,468658.0
7,addition to Socrates there's a bunch of,468659.0,470249.0
7,people complaining about Latin,470250.0,472109.0
7,errors that people were making in kind,472110.0,474149.0
7,of medieval Latin and being like 'these,474150.0,475529.0
7,"people they speak terrible Latin, they",475530.0,477179.0
7,write terrible Latin' and a lot of those,477180.0,479098.0
7,so-called errors became totally common,479099.0,482008.0
7,and unremarkable conventions in the,482009.0,484198.0
7,"romance languages, in French and Spanish",484199.0,485788.0
7,Italian and so on L: oh yeah all of the,485789.0,487529.0
7,romance languages are really quote,487530.0,489329.0
7,unquote corrupted forms of Latin but now,489330.0,491999.0
7,we think of them as really fancy G: yeah. My,492000.0,494369.0
7,favorite example - so I actually put a call,494370.0,496499.0
7,out on Twitter for this because I just,496500.0,497968.0
7,had a feeling that somebody must have,497969.0,499758.0
7,complained about this at some point when,499759.0,502439.0
7,English and French were kind of mixing,502440.0,504119.0
7,together after the Norman conquest and,504120.0,505769.0
7,Dave Sayers who's a linguist came to the,505770.0,508559.0
7,rescue and pointed out that,508560.0,510179.0
7,"this historian, Bokenham, in 1440 has",510180.0,514679.0
7,this long complaint which is written in -,514680.0,518009.0
7,you can kind of understand it because,518010.0,519629.0
7,it's Middle English,519630.0,521459.0
7,"at this point right, but I will not try",521460.0,523199.0
7,to read the Middle English I'll read a,523200.0,524579.0
7,part of the translation which says 'and,524580.0,526708.0
7,this corruption of Englishmen in their,526709.0,529139.0
7,mother tongue begun as I have said,529140.0,531299.0
7,in the everyday admixture of first,531300.0,533729.0
7,"Danish then Norman, was greatly augmented",533730.0,537479.0
7,and increased after the arrival of,537480.0,539429.0
7,William the Conqueror by two things' and,539430.0,541229.0
7,so on and so forth and then skipping to,541230.0,546479.0
7,a later part of the paragraph 'and seeing,546480.0,548369.0
7,this the rural people saw that they,548370.0,550319.0
7,might seem to be the more esteemed and,550320.0,552148.0
7,honorable and the more easily opened to,552149.0,554039.0
7,the acquaintance of the worthy and the,554040.0,555509.0
7,"great, abandoned their mother tongue and",555510.0,559199.0
7,"laboured to be able to speak French, and",559200.0,561059.0
7,thus in the course of time barbarise them,561060.0,563669.0
7,both and spoke neither good French nor,563670.0,566069.0
7,good English' L: Ha! I love it so much! So basically,566070.0,573059.0
7,the English we have now that is,573060.0,575129.0
7,maybe a third lexical items borrowed from,575130.0,579239.0
7,French would just upset this guy a lot,579240.0,582059.0
7,"G: this guy was really mad, and I mean the",582060.0,584009.0
7,ironic thing is of course he uses some,584010.0,586109.0
7,French words in his complaint L: ahh yeah but they're the,586110.0,588359.0
7,ok ones G: yeah so he uses words like,588360.0,591119.0
7,'corruption' and 'familiar' and 'augmentation',591120.0,593819.0
7,and 'honourable' and all of these words,593820.0,595619.0
7,come from French in his complaint L: that,595620.0,596939.0
7,is so good G: but he's still really annoyed,596940.0,600689.0
7,by this - 'they barbarise them both and,600690.0,603088.0
7,speak neither good French nor good English',603089.0,604979.0
7,"L: also known as modern English G: yep sorry,",604980.0,609629.0
7,sorry guys! L: yeah that is so good. So peeving,609630.0,612599.0
7,about how people are speaking today and,612600.0,616049.0
7,how the modern,616050.0,617789.0
7,generations are ruining language is a,617790.0,619828.0
7,thing that we have a long and studied,619829.0,622199.0
7,"history of G: I just, but it's just going",622200.0,624389.0
7,to like in 500 years or in a thousand,624390.0,626909.0
7,years it's going to make you look like,626910.0,629039.0
7,you didn't know what you were doing so,629040.0,630389.0
7,why not just skip that and not peeve in the,630390.0,633778.0
7,first place! L: so people have been,633779.0,635009.0
7,complaining about the way people talk,635010.0,637439.0
7,for a very long time but what I also,637440.0,639359.0
7,find quite fascinating is often the,639360.0,641458.0
7,things that people complain about,641459.0,643499.0
7,young people doing aren't necessarily,643500.0,646469.0
7,"just done by young people, and a",646470.0,649259.0
7,lot of the complaints about features of,649260.0,651719.0
7,language that people find irritating are,651720.0,653909.0
7,often found across their own generation,653910.0,656069.0
7,as well but for some reason they kind of,656070.0,657899.0
7,focus on young people doing it G: perception,657900.0,660689.0
7,bias isn't a thing right?! L: perception bias,660690.0,662369.0
7,is like a massive thing here and 'like' is,662370.0,665219.0
7,a really great example of this because,665220.0,667619.0
7,there are some uses of 'like' that people,667620.0,670379.0
7,find irritating but have been used for,670380.0,672479.0
7,hundreds of years G: yeah so there's a,672480.0,674909.0
7,linguist who is kind of the,674910.0,677579.0
7,L: she's like the boss of 'like' G: she is like,677580.0,680249.0
7,the person who knows things about 'like',680250.0,682259.0
7,and her name is Alexandra Darcy and,682260.0,684539.0
7,she's a linguist at University of,684540.0,686039.0
7,Victoria in BC and she has done a whole,686040.0,690659.0
7,bunch of stuff about 'like'. She's looked,690660.0,692069.0
7,"at different people's uses of it,",692070.0,693449.0
7,"perceptions of it, she's just come up",693450.0,695069.0
7,"with a book called '800 years of like',",695070.0,697049.0
7,which is about how like has an eight,697050.0,699509.0
7,"hundred year history, I haven't read the book",699510.0,700649.0
7,"yet, I assume it's good L: she's really",700650.0,703739.0
7,"great and I love this, she's done quite a",703740.0,705389.0
7,few interviews and I've read some of her,705390.0,706799.0
7,shorter stuff so I feel confident in,706800.0,709169.0
7,"saying that the book would be good G yes,",709170.0,710879.0
7,she's done a great interview with,710880.0,712679.0
7,"Lexicon Valley, so you can check",712680.0,714629.0
7,that out if you'd like more podcast things. And,714630.0,716129.0
7,she's talked about 'like' and,716130.0,718469.0
7,one of the points that she's made in,718470.0,719699.0
7,one of her papers is that it's not,719700.0,721529.0
7,randomly inserted. So one of the things,721530.0,725099.0
7,that people have as a perception of 'like',725100.0,726989.0
7,is like 'oh people are just throwing,726990.0,728099.0
7,it around randomly and inserting it,728100.0,729659.0
7,"randomly'. She says no, you can actually",729660.0,731069.0
7,characterize a bunch of different,731070.0,732749.0
7,functions that it has and where each of,732750.0,735059.0
7,those go with respect to other kinds of,735060.0,736889.0
7,words. So there's the approximate of 'like',736890.0,739979.0
7,which is the one when you say 'what are,739980.0,741989.0
7,"we having for dinner?' 'Oh I don't know, like, pasta'",741990.0,744629.0
7,which doesn't commit you to having,744630.0,746129.0
7,specifically pasta but something in that,746130.0,747749.0
7,general domain. Or there's quotative,747750.0,750059.0
7,"'like', which is one of my favorites,",750060.0,752039.0
7,which is when you say 'and then I was,752040.0,753959.0
7,like' 'and then she was like' to introduce,753960.0,755849.0
7,reported speech L: I find it so useful G: it's,755850.0,758789.0
7,so useful. The cool thing about quotative,758790.0,760439.0
7,'like' is that you can use it to introduce,760440.0,762838.0
7,some things that's not a direct quote.,762839.0,765088.0
7,So you can say something like and,765089.0,767549.0
7,'I was like...' and then you can make a,767550.0,769079.0
7,facial expression. Or you can use it,769080.0,771059.0
7,to introduce what you're thinking rather,771060.0,773159.0
7,"than what you're saying, so you can say",773160.0,774779.0
7,something like 'and I was like I can't,774780.0,775799.0
7,believe this but I said,775800.0,777088.0
7,blah blah blah' 'oh really how,777089.0,779068.0
7,"interesting', so you can use the kind of",779069.0,780869.0
7,manage the dichotomy around various,780870.0,783119.0
7,different ways that you could react or,783120.0,784498.0
7,that you could say in response to,784499.0,785578.0
7,something. So it had a lot more subtlety,785579.0,786748.0
7,than 'said' L: the evolution of 'like',786749.0,789058.0
7,and the fact that a lot of people use,789059.0,790768.0
7,many of the uses. but young people,790769.0,792838.0

7,"a very creative thing to do, but there",800279.0,802768.0
7,are these like red flags that just go up,802769.0,805859.0
7,for people when certain things happen,805860.0,807539.0
7,and it is often only when young people,807540.0,809398.0
7,do it. So an older person may use like in,809399.0,812128.0
7,many similar ways but it flies under the,812129.0,814318.0
7,radar G: yeah. I think one of my favorite,814319.0,816268.0
7,responses to the quotative 'like' thing is,816269.0,818909.0
7,"an XKCD comic we'll link to, and its",818910.0,822088.0
7,dialogue and it says 'I found this,822089.0,823558.0
7,"article on the linguistics of quotative 'like,'",823559.0,825119.0
7,like when you're like she was like',825120.0,827248.0
7,she's like 'yeah featured a quote from a,827249.0,829558.0
7,linguist Patricia Cukor-Avila' - I don't know if,829559.0,831778.0
7,I'm saying that right - 'eventually all,831779.0,833188.0
7,people who hate this kind of thing,833189.0,834539.0
7,are going to be dead and the ones who,834540.0,835799.0
7,use it are going to be in control' and,835800.0,837568.0
7,then the other character says 'wow linguists,837569.0,839518.0
7,are pretty hardcore!' ...I think,839519.0,841588.0
7,she means dead for old age. I'm gonna,841589.0,844438.0
7,start saying 'like' more just in case! So,844439.0,849148.0
7,every linguist of my acquaintance posted,849149.0,851068.0
7,about this being like 'we are hardcore,851069.0,852479.0
7,we're totally hardcore thanks for,852480.0,853678.0
7,recognising this xkcd' L: but I think,853679.0,855328.0
7,this touches on an important thing that,855329.0,857248.0
7,often gets lost or has historically,857249.0,859708.0
7,gotten lost in the rhetoric around,859709.0,861028.0
7,"linguists being descriptive, it's a",861029.0,863518.0
7,chicken and egg thing - what we're saying,863519.0,865258.0
7,"is 'this is what people do, isn't it an",865259.0,867178.0
7,interesting phenomenon' and that's,867179.0,868888.0
7,interpreted as linguists saying 'this is,868889.0,871888.0
7,a good thing to do so do it'. We're saying,871889.0,873419.0
7,'no it's good because it's interesting,873420.0,874948.0
7,"to us' G: it's there, it's just it's a",874949.0,877828.0
7,reflection of what exists L: and,877829.0,879778.0
7,us saying that it's actually,879779.0,881369.0
7,interesting and complex and has its own,881370.0,882958.0
7,rules doesn't mean that we're,882959.0,885088.0
7,necessarily advocating that you have to,885089.0,887278.0
7,do this G: but I think we'd be putting our,887279.0,889409.0
7,fingers in our ears and closing our eyes,889410.0,891088.0
7,and going 'na na na na na I can't hear you',891089.0,893068.0
7,is to say 'oh this doesn't exist so we,893069.0,895438.0
7,can't analyze it because it doesn't fit,895439.0,896818.0
7,with our idea of what English should,896819.0,898919.0
7,sound like' L: and I think it's also,898920.0,900239.0
7,important to acknowledge that just,900240.0,902278.0
7,because we notice it's a phenomenon,902279.0,904409.0
7,doesn't mean that we don't still,904410.0,906208.0
7,encourage people to use appropriate,906209.0,908219.0
7,language in appropriate domains.,908220.0,910559.0
7,So something like quotative 'like' is I,910560.0,914189.0
7,"think completely acceptable, I use it all",914190.0,916019.0
7,the time and I find it really useful but,916020.0,918899.0
7,I definitely wouldn't encourage a,918900.0,920459.0

7,"be surprised, you know novel tend to",929640.0,931619.0
7,use 'said' still for dialogue tags but I,931620.0,934799.0
7,"think that that's a, you know, language",934800.0,937019.0
7,has multiple registers and multiple,937020.0,938999.0
7,styles that are used in different,939000.0,940559.0

7,"one of them has to be wrong,",942330.0,943919.0
7,like we have different types of clothes,943920.0,945329.0
7,that we wear for different situations,945330.0,946439.0
7,that doesn't mean that the only correct,946440.0,948479.0
7,clothing is like one kind - you must be,948480.0,952259.0
7,wearing a three-piece suit and if you're,952260.0,953999.0

7,"time! And that's part of, I mean I",960060.0,962699.0
7,don't want to draw attention to our own,962700.0,964199.0
7,languages because people have to listen,964200.0,966119.0
7,to it but I definitely don't speak like,966120.0,968969.0
7,I talk to you on the podcast in the,968970.0,971159.0
7,"same way as I do in a job interview, and",971160.0,973499.0
7,we're probably even more informal when,973500.0,975719.0
7,we're not trying to be articulate for,975720.0,977969.0
7,"podcasting G: or like with children, or with",977970.0,980699.0
7,"a pet or something, like you talk",980700.0,982109.0
7,differently. But I think it's also worth,982110.0,983579.0
7,pointing out that what we think of as,983580.0,985709.0
7,formal and correct and so on when it,985710.0,988409.0
7,comes to language is also based a lot on,988410.0,990599.0
7,the existing power dynamics that happen,990600.0,993389.0
7,in our society. So the type of English,993390.0,995819.0
7,"that we think of as the best English,",995820.0,997409.0
7,it's not like we did a survey of all the,997410.0,999599.0
7,english's and they analysed them for like,999600.0,1001819.0
7,their expressive capability and they,1001820.0,1003588.0
7,were like 'after a sober consideration of,1003589.0,1005659.0
7,"the merits we've decided this one' L: no,",1005660.0,1007909.0
7,it's often the... and I think it one thing we,1007910.0,1011329.0
7,probably should've flagged earlier on in the,1011330.0,1013129.0
7,conversation is we're talking mostly,1013130.0,1014599.0
7,about age based differences even though,1014600.0,1017719.0
7,they're somewhat arbitrary here but of,1017720.0,1019699.0
7,course there are other socio,1019700.0,1021349.0
7,linguistic factors that this interacts,1021350.0,1023779.0
7,with and there's gender and there's,1023780.0,1025999.0
7,level of education and there's race and,1026000.0,1029239.0
7,there's different dynamics happening in,1029240.0,1031099.0
7,the UK and the US. All of this,1031100.0,1033948.0
7,"interplays, and I think sociolinguists have",1033949.0,1035389.0
7,"always been really great, especially the",1035390.0,1037399.0
7,kind of ones who look at variation in,1037400.0,1039229.0
7,different groups have always been really great,1039230.0,1040789.0
7,at acknowledging a lot of these factors,1040790.0,1042469.0
7,G: yeah. But we come into this saying,1042470.0,1044448.0
7,'well the type of English that's,1044449.0,1045739.0
7,been considered the best is the kind,1045740.0,1047208.0
7,that's you know modeled on Latin that's spoken,1047209.0,1049428.0
7,by upper-class British dudes from like,1049429.0,1051589.0

7,"particular type of English, it has no",1054380.0,1055999.0
7,more particular merits than any other,1056000.0,1057979.0

7,wanted to be associated with that type,1060649.0,1062119.0
7,of group have been L: perpetuating that,1062120.0,1063888.0
7,standard G: exactly L: which is more or less,1063889.0,1065898.0
7,accessible to different people and we,1065899.0,1067969.0
7,acknowledge that and that's why it's,1067970.0,1069619.0
7,"important to teach, I think, the",1069620.0,1071359.0
7,idea that there are genres and there,1071360.0,1073489.0
7,"are audiences, and the variety of English",1073490.0,1076069.0
7,that you might speak at home or to your,1076070.0,1077808.0
7,"friends is not necessarily less valid,",1077809.0,1079759.0
7,"it's just not the 'genre appropriate' G: yeah,",1079760.0,1082729.0
7,it's complicated because a lot of people,1082730.0,1084138.0
7,get taught in school 'okay this is the,1084139.0,1086148.0
7,right way to do things' or this is what',1086149.0,1087648.0
7,you need to do' and on,1087649.0,1089479.0
7,the one hand you can say okay well the,1089480.0,1090678.0
7,schools trying to give you the skills to,1090679.0,1091819.0
7,survive in the world where people are,1091820.0,1093138.0
7,going to judge you based on your,1093139.0,1094158.0
7,language but they're also perpetuating the,1094159.0,1096048.0
7,ideology that makes it okay to judge,1096049.0,1097548.0
7,other people based on their language,1097549.0,1098719.0
7,"L: yeo, and I used to be a bit of a peever",1098720.0,1101329.0
7,and like feel like I kind of knew,1101330.0,1104658.0
7,these three things about language but,1104659.0,1107119.0
7,actually because I'm rubbish at spelling,1107120.0,1108768.0
7,and because I've often had not the kind,1108769.0,1111918.0
7,of default best accent quote-unquote as,1111919.0,1114739.0
7,an Australian in other context I kind of,1114740.0,1117199.0
7,learnt really quickly,1117200.0,1119569.0
7,that like complaining about,1119570.0,1121249.0
7,the way other people use language wasn't,1121250.0,1122749.0
7,going to get me very far because I'm not,1122750.0,1125178.0
7,always that standard at it myself G: yeah I,1125179.0,1128058.0
7,think there's a lot of stuff around,1128059.0,1129979.0
7,"the Canadian accent, some people...",1129980.0,1131479.0
7,because it's not quite the same as the,1131480.0,1132589.0
7,"U.S., but Americans tend to have a very",1132590.0,1133908.0
7,caricatured idea of what constitutes a,1133909.0,1135859.0
7,Canadian accent and then having a Nova,1135860.0,1137298.0
7,Scotian accent within that I also have,1137299.0,1138888.0
7,non standard features but I think like,1138889.0,1140629.0
7,when I initially interested in,1140630.0,1141798.0
7,"language it often gets conflated, the",1141799.0,1143509.0
7,idea that oh you're interested in,1143510.0,1145908.0
7,linguistics so you must also be,1145909.0,1147619.0
7,interested in like judging people's,1147620.0,1149119.0
7,grammar L: yeah I got a bunch of those,1149120.0,1150739.0
7,books from people early on G: and you know,1150740.0,1153079.0
7,if I meet people at parties and they're,1153080.0,1154308.0
7,like 'oh you're a linguist I guess I,1154309.0,1155599.0
7,better watch how I talk around you!' I'm like,1155600.0,1157158.0
7,"'no no no please don't!' - well, I mean, I'm",1157159.0,1158898.0
7,interested in what you're doing but like,1158899.0,1160308.0
7,"I'm not, like I'm going to analyse your",1160309.0,1162768.0
7,"vowels, but like I don't want to",1162769.0,1164418.0
7,criticise you for them L: that's the thing,1164419.0,1166219.0
7,I find interesting is these like,1166220.0,1167538.0
7,complaints about language tend to center,1167539.0,1169579.0
7,on the same things again and again.,1169580.0,1171918.0
7,Whether or not people use 'like' all over,1171919.0,1174168.0
7,"the place is one of them, people are",1174169.0,1176089.0
7,"really obsessed with 'literally',",1176090.0,1178089.0
7,literally obsessed G: hyperbolic literally.,1178090.0,1180859.0
7,"I mean hyperbole is a thing, hyperbole is",1180860.0,1182808.0
7,a real thing that people do I don't,1182809.0,1184128.0
7,think anyone complains that saying like,1184129.0,1185599.0
7,'I told you once I've told you a million,1185600.0,1187189.0
7,times' like suddenly no one understands,1187190.0,1188748.0
7,what million means anymore L: yeah you know,1188749.0,1190998.0
7,like everyone's pretty chill about,1190999.0,1192709.0
7,fabulous meaning that something's pretty,1192710.0,1194689.0
7,good these days no one's like 'I'm sorry,1194690.0,1197028.0
7,but it doesn't pertain to fables why are,1197029.0,1200058.0
7,using the word fabulous' G: I mean to be,1200059.0,1202278.0
7,honest I actually don't think we're,1202279.0,1203628.0
7,"being pedantic enough about 'literally',",1203629.0,1205428.0
7,because it literally means pertaining to,1205429.0,1207439.0
7,"a letter, and so if you're not using",1207440.0,1209689.0
7,literal to mean pertaining to the,1209690.0,1211608.0
7,alphabet I think you're using it wrong,1211609.0,1213648.0
7,L: if you are not struck down by absolute,1213649.0,1217878.0
7,"pure awe, the thing is not awesome",1217879.0,1220488.0
7,"G: true, true! But also awesome and",1220489.0,1222888.0
7,awful mean the same thing and like if,1222889.0,1225018.0
7,you use them to mean different things,1225019.0,1226579.0
7,you're you know... L: yeah so once you start,1226580.0,1228558.0
7,"it's like a leveling up right, like you",1228559.0,1231199.0
7,start and you're like 'oh language has,1231200.0,1233058.0
7,rules and here are a few I've learnt and,1233059.0,1235729.0

7,not also knowing these secret club rules',1237710.0,1239748.0
7,and then you kind of learn that,1239749.0,1241788.0
7,actually all language is somewhat,1241789.0,1244308.0
7,arbitrary and changing all the time and,1244309.0,1246528.0
7,a lot of things that people take as,1246529.0,1248388.0
7,hardcore rules and don't like other,1248389.0,1251089.0
7,people not doing were at their own time,1251090.0,1253398.0
7,"like arbitrary, non-standard uses and",1253399.0,1255498.0
7,then you feel a bit more relaxed about,1255499.0,1256729.0
7,"things G: yeah, like etymology is really fun,",1256730.0,1259069.0
7,like I like learning where words come,1259070.0,1261229.0
7,from and 'oh these three words actually,1261230.0,1262849.0
7,have this hidden connection' like that's,1262850.0,1264138.0
7,really interesting. This nice graph by,1264139.0,1265849.0
7,"Rob Drummond that illustrates this, which",1265850.0,1267768.0
7,"we can link to, and it kind of shows that",1267769.0,1269928.0
7,when you start learning things about,1269929.0,1271368.0
7,language often you're knowledge,1271369.0,1272868.0
7,about language and you're pedantry,1272869.0,1274278.0
7,increase in lockstep with each other and,1274279.0,1276798.0
7,then at a certain point your knowledge,1276799.0,1278508.0
7,about language levels off for a bit - it's a,1278509.0,1280219.0
7,stylised graph - and your pedantry just,1280220.0,1282408.0
7,"massively increases, and then as you keep",1282409.0,1284089.0
7,learning more you realise there's actually,1284090.0,1286069.0
7,no point in being pedantic about it and,1286070.0,1287778.0
7,in fact your pedantry goes right the way down,1287779.0,1289668.0
7,and you start getting really annoyed by,1289669.0,1291229.0
7,people who are who are annoyed about,1291230.0,1292459.0

7,really kind of flexible slangy language,1556970.0,1559159.0
7,because he learned to do telegrams in,1559160.0,1562579.0

7,awkward non-smartphone keys is really,1566270.0,1569329.0

7,you get the inverse of what people,1575240.0,1576619.0

7,"quality is in sheer number of words,",1599870.0,1602058.0
7,because obviously if you write the,1602059.0,1604819.0
7,most words that is the best. I'm kidding,1604820.0,1606979.0
7,a little bit here but there's a really,1606980.0,1608329.0
7,"interesting study that looked at this,",1608330.0,1610849.0
7,Andrea Lunsford and Karen Lunsford they,1610850.0,1613158.0
7,looked at a longitudinal study of,1613159.0,1614869.0
7,student writing across the decades and,1614870.0,1617808.0
7,so they looked at papers from like,1617809.0,1621288.0
7,"American college students,",1621289.0,1622878.0
7,"first-year University students in 1917,",1622879.0,1625689.0
7,"1930, 1986, and 2006 L: cool, what a spread",1625690.0,1630378.0
7,G: yeah so it's almost a hundred years of,1630379.0,1632989.0
7,different points in what students in,1632990.0,1635928.0
7,first-year composition writing,1635929.0,1637668.0
7,"classes are doing, and they found a",1637669.0,1639258.0
7,couple really interesting things. One is,1639259.0,1641058.0
7,"that they found that the essay writing,",1641059.0,1644449.0
7,"the number of words per essay, has",1644450.0,1646729.0
7,increased by 10 times L: what?! G: yeah! So in,1646730.0,1649729.0
7,1917 the students wrote an average of a,1649730.0,1652308.0
7,hundred and sixty two words per essay,1652309.0,1654499.0
7,L: that's not an essay that's a paragraph!,1654500.0,1656298.0
7,G: oh well it was written by hand in like big,1656299.0,1659329.0
7,fountain pens so I guess it looks like it an essay!,1659330.0,1661008.0
7,"L: yeah yeah, fair enough G: and in 1986",1661009.0,1664878.0
7,"they wrote 422 words right, and in 2006",1664879.0,1669229.0
7,they wrote over a thousand words L: Wow,1669230.0,1671569.0
7,G: and so then the number of words,1671570.0,1673158.0
7,"they've written is greatly increased, but",1673159.0,1674959.0
7,what's interesting is that the number of,1674960.0,1677329.0
7,errors yeah stayed remarkably constant,1677330.0,1679999.0
7,over 100 years. So students in 2006,1680000.0,1682939.0
7,"are making the same number of errors,",1682940.0,1684258.0
7,"but they made different errors L: okay,",1684259.0,1686538.0
7,that kind of makes sense G: so in the,1686539.0,1689719.0
7,earlier studies the biggest biggest,1689720.0,1692298.0
7,"error was spelling errors, but in 2006",1692299.0,1694999.0
7,the students aren't making spelling errors,1695000.0,1696619.0
7,anymore because their computer,1696620.0,1697758.0
7,"processing their papers, and they",1697759.0,1699528.0
7,"have spellcheck now, and so now the",1699529.0,1700849.0
7,"biggest error became wrong word, so now",1700850.0,1703969.0
7,they're using spellcheck but they pick,1703970.0,1705558.0
7,the wrong word. Another thing that's,1705559.0,1706969.0
7,changed is what the writing instructors,1706970.0,1710658.0
7,"prioritise, because",1710659.0,1711829.0
7,how they decided whether something was,1711830.0,1713119.0
7,"an error, is they had a bunch of",1713120.0,1714619.0
7,"University professors mark the papers,",1714620.0,1716298.0
7,the professor's decided what to,1716299.0,1718398.0
7,consider an error and one of the big,1718399.0,1720829.0
7,errors that showed up in 2006 was,1720830.0,1723139.0
7,"incomplete or missing documentation,",1723140.0,1725268.0
7,meaning they did the citations wrong - but in,1725269.0,1727459.0
7,1917 they weren't even expecting,1727460.0,1729048.0
7,students to write citations! L: so the kids,1729049.0,1731268.0
7,doing okay is basically the take away,1731269.0,1733398.0
7,G: the kids are doing okay L: once you become,1733399.0,1736038.0
7,aware of the fact that a lot of this,1736039.0,1738288.0
7,change isn't as strongly generational as,1738289.0,1741319.0
7,"we think it is, and it often actually",1741320.0,1744589.0
7,shows really positive things about,1744590.0,1746329.0
7,"younger people's language use, it seems",1746330.0,1750018.0
7,like quite a bizarre thing to be so hung,1750019.0,1753048.0
7,up on complaining about what the kids,1753049.0,1755089.0
7,are doing these days G: I think language is,1755090.0,1757819.0
7,a thing you can project a lot of your,1757820.0,1759589.0
7,"other worries on, so any worries",1759590.0,1761689.0
7,you have about the kids you can project,1761690.0,1763249.0
7,on their language. So I want to coin,1763250.0,1766189.0
7,"a term, Lauren can I coin a term? L: okay",1766190.0,1768319.0
7,this is your one term that you can coin,1768320.0,1770268.0
7,"for this episode, go GL so I think there's",1770269.0,1773479.0

7,dismissing the ideas contained in an argument,1776899.0,1779359.0
7,because it's coached in terms that are,1779360.0,1783199.0
7,"not prestigious linguistically, so",1783200.0,1785959.0
7,saying that 'you said something,1785960.0,1787819.0

7,"think this is a logical fallacy, and I",1802519.0,1804109.0
7,think this is a logical fallacy that's,1804110.0,1805849.0
7,kind of like an ad hominem attack where,1805850.0,1807558.0
7,you say 'oh well you're ugly so your,1807559.0,1809569.0

7,this fancy Latinate term that you've made,1820610.0,1823249.0
7,up G: I needed to take advantage of my,1823250.0,1826969.0
7,misspent Latin education L: I don't even,1826970.0,1829699.0
7,know if it's 'vocum' or vocum',1829700.0,1830869.0
7,G: this is what I love it's like there's no,1830870.0,1832969.0
7,"right way to say it, it could be 'vocum', it",1832970.0,1835129.0
7,"could be 'vocum', it could be 'vocum', I",1835130.0,1837109.0
7,don't know! There's like four right,1837110.0,1838759.0
7,things! If you criticize someone for the,1838760.0,1840739.0
7,one they pick you're doing it! L: So are you,1840740.0,1842808.0

7,vacillate and choose a different one,1845510.0,1846919.0
7,each time just to keep people on their,1846920.0,1848299.0
7,toes? G: yeah! I've been thinking about this,1848300.0,1850009.0
7,term because we were planning,1850010.0,1851629.0
7,this episode and I was thinking 'I think there,1851630.0,1853009.0
7,should be word for this' and I'm very,1853010.0,1854749.0
7,inconsistent myself with how I say it,1854750.0,1856189.0
7,"and I think that's great, I think that",1856190.0,1857869.0
7,there's allowed to be multiple,1857870.0,1859879.0
7,competing standards. If you want to,1859880.0,1861559.0
7,engage in an argument in good faith the,1861560.0,1863239.0
7,way to do that is not to be persnickety,1863240.0,1866179.0
7,about how someone saying it and say 'what are the,1866180.0,1868249.0
7,"ideas, do they have merits?'.",1868250.0,1870349.0
7,Someone can be an eloquent orator and,1870350.0,1871939.0
7,"still have terrible terrible ideas, if",1871940.0,1874519.0
7,you name it as logical fallacy and if,1874520.0,1876349.0
7,you coach it in the terms of like 'oh it's,1876350.0,1878569.0
7,"Latinate, it's fancy' then maybe that's",1878570.0,1881599.0
7,"something we can borrow, some prestige",1881600.0,1883339.0
7,from Latin to say 'nobody wants to do a,1883340.0,1885409.0
7,logical fallacy!' Like this is a thing,1885410.0,1887419.0
7,that we should recognize in ourselves.,1887420.0,1888559.0
7,And if you are someone who likes calling,1888560.0,1891049.0
7,people out on stuff the fun part is by,1891050.0,1893209.0
7,switching over to being more tolerant,1893210.0,1895849.0
7,about language you then get to call out,1895850.0,1897529.0
7,all the people who are being critical,1897530.0,1899869.0
7,about it instead of the people who are,1899870.0,1901729.0
7,"using apostrophes correctly, so you",1901730.0,1903859.0
7,still a group of people to get,1903860.0,1905479.0
7,"annoyed at, but you get to feel like",1905480.0,1906859.0
7,you're contributing to a more positive,1906860.0,1908149.0
7,cause L: I think it also means that you can,1908150.0,1910279.0
7,give people more useful feedback on,1910280.0,1914149.0
7,"language use, so instead of saying",1914150.0,1916099.0
7,'don't use this form' you can say 'in a,1916100.0,1919039.0
7,"formal essay don't do this, you can still",1919040.0,1921559.0
7,use that in text messages' G: you can,1921560.0,1923539.0
7,say things like 'the conventions of the,1923540.0,1924919.0
7,"genre are as follows, if you'd like to",1924920.0,1926719.0
7,not follow the conventions of the genre,1926720.0,1927979.0
7,"that's a decision you can make, but you",1927980.0,1929419.0
7,should be aware that this is what the,1929420.0,1930349.0
7,conventions are'. And another takeaway,1930350.0,1932359.0
7,is if you look at what kids actually do when,1932360.0,1935539.0
7,they're exposed to fragmented or,1935540.0,1937909.0
7,"incomplete linguistic input, they",1937910.0,1940009.0
7,actually create full-fledged languages,1940010.0,1942499.0

7,linguistic circumstances L: a really famous,1944870.0,1946819.0
7,example of that that we have is,1946820.0,1948459.0
7,"Nicaraguan sign language, and the fact",1948460.0,1950749.0
7,that we've taken until episode 7 to talk,1950750.0,1952729.0
7,about it it's actually pretty impressive,1952730.0,1954379.0
7,because it's such a great go to anecdote,1954380.0,1958159.0
7,"for linguists, and such an amazing thing",1958160.0,1960349.0
7,that happened. In the 70s and 80s in,1960350.0,1963079.0
7,Nicaragua there was a change in policy,1963080.0,1965269.0
7,that meant that a lot of deaf children,1965270.0,1966439.0
7,suddenly came together at school instead,1966440.0,1968719.0
7,of being isolated and using their,1968720.0,1971029.0

7,course of a couple of generations,1977690.0,1979279.0
7,went from all having kind of only a,1979280.0,1981379.0

8,is a super exciting genre of book for,71729.0,75779.0
8,linguists to be interested in and this,75780.0,78059.0
8,is for a number of reasons. The first of,78060.0,80069.0
8,which is Kory Stamper's new book 'Word,80070.0,82709.0
8,By Word' came out a couple of months ago,82710.0,85109.0

8,"Kory's book so appealing, Word By Word",278730.0,281459.0

8,was really cool because you can I,301290.0,302579.0
8,thought I was really able to picture it,302580.0,304289.0
8,and now I feel like you know if I went,304290.0,305819.0
8,there - hopefully someday maybe I'll go,305820.0,307529.0

8,"how all of the stuff works, it was really",336710.0,338658.0

8,of the South by Southwest talk that you,343699.0,346158.0
8,went and did a couple of months ago now,346159.0,348258.0
8,G: it was in March yeah and so I did a,348259.0,351228.0
8,"panel with Erin McKean of Wordnik,",351229.0,353088.0
8,Jane Solomon of dictionary.com and Ben,353089.0,354978.0
8,"Zimmer who I've already mentioned, who I saw",354979.0,356538.0
8,a lot in March. So we did a panel about,356539.0,358579.0
8,"dictionaries, tech and the future at South",358580.0,360318.0
8,by Southwest and we talked about,360319.0,362088.0
8,"you know, how do you construct dictionary?",362089.0,364068.0
8,How do you decide what to let into the,364069.0,365869.0
8,"dictionary? so Erin's approach with Wordnik,",365870.0,368028.0
8,which you know kind of reimagines,368029.0,369528.0
8,the dictionary from the tradition of the,369529.0,370698.0
8,"paper dictionary, which is very",370699.0,371898.0
8,limited to like how many pages you can,371899.0,373998.0
8,"have in that, Erin's approach with Wordnik",373999.0,375918.0
8,"is if someone has searched for it,",375919.0,377628.0
8,we'll give you a page that has whatever,377629.0,379519.0
8,"information we have, and if no one has",379520.0,381258.0
8,search for it before and no one has,381259.0,382638.0
8,added anything to that page there's,382639.0,383898.0
8,"nothing on it, but for some words there",383899.0,386179.0
8,is stuff on it. So I asked,386180.0,387978.0
8,"them, is there any thought of adding",387979.0,389388.0
8,emoji to the dictionary? The 'face with tears,389389.0,391278.0
8,of joy emoji' was Oxford's Word of the,391279.0,392929.0
8,Year 2015 I think. I asked them you know,392930.0,395088.0
8,are you going to add emoji in there and Erin said well,395089.0,396588.0
8,you can search for emoji on Wordnik - for a,396589.0,398299.0
8,lot of them you might not find very much,398300.0,399799.0
8,information but you can search for them.,399800.0,401088.0
8,You know they've got this kind of,401089.0,402109.0
8,crowd-sourced approach to adding stuff,402110.0,403998.0
8,about particular words in addition to,403999.0,406458.0
8,the base dictionary that they started,406459.0,408378.0
8,"with, so people can add information about",408379.0,410388.0
8,those L: dictionaries are in an interesting,410389.0,412038.0
8,"state of flux at the moment, I think it's",412039.0,414648.0
8,fair to say like very few people are,414649.0,416838.0
8,buying or interacting with paper,416839.0,419028.0
8,"dictionaries, more and more people are",419029.0,421398.0
8,"using online resources exclusively, and",421399.0,424098.0
8,also dictionary makers are moving from,424099.0,426648.0
8,using written things to add,426649.0,428958.0
8,to the dictionary and searching online,428959.0,430869.0
8,corpora instead. So that leads to some,430870.0,433728.0
8,interesting ways in which dictionaries,433729.0,435918.0
8,will change G: and people who are using,435919.0,437478.0
8,"dictionaries themselves, not just",437479.0,438468.0
8,dictionary makers that are using,438469.0,439818.0
8,"electronic sources, but people who are",439819.0,441138.0
8,searching for words in a dictionary,441139.0,442489.0
8,rather than opening up... you know I have a,442490.0,445188.0
8,"bunch of dictionaries on my shelf, I'm",445189.0,446329.0
8,"looking over and seeing them right now, I",446330.0,447648.0
8,have dictionaries for several languages,447649.0,449299.0
8,"on my shelf, but when was the last time I",449300.0,450888.0
8,pulled one off and opened it and used it,450889.0,452898.0
8,"for something? It's not very often,",452899.0,454518.0
8,because I'm like 'well I'm already at my,454519.0,455929.0
8,computer' I can just,455930.0,458148.0
8,search for the word there L: which I,458149.0,459528.0
8,think is really great in terms of,459529.0,461328.0
8,usability and accessibility.,461329.0,463489.0
8,I think it,463490.0,464379.0
8,"it makes us feel like the dictionary,",464380.0,465939.0
8,it's the same problem that journalism,465940.0,468039.0
8,and a lot of other industries have as,468040.0,469389.0
8,"well, we feel like we're entitled to",469390.0,471309.0
8,"dictionaries, even more than we have ever",471310.0,473529.0
8,felt throughout history. I think,473530.0,475419.0
8,again one thing I really loved about,475420.0,477279.0
8,"Word By Word, is the book kind of shows",477280.0,479379.0
8,you that it's a massive labour to,479380.0,482109.0
8,write a dictionary and to keep it up to,482110.0,484659.0
8,date,484660.0,484869.0
8,and this is real work that has to be,484870.0,486309.0
8,"done by real humans, computers aren't",486310.0,488349.0
8,actually that good at doing that work,488350.0,489699.0
8,"G: yeah, we have this perception that there's",489700.0,491529.0
8,"'a dictionary', and I trolled my panel because",491530.0,494589.0
8,I was moderating them and I said 'okay,494590.0,496269.0
8,which one of you is 'the dictionary'? like,496270.0,497859.0
8,do we have a fight here?' L: did you find out,497860.0,499809.0
8,which one is 'the dictionary'? G: they all,499810.0,501729.0
8,"claimed it, it was very disappointing!",501730.0,504759.0
8,We have a perception that the dictionary is,504760.0,506049.0
8,like a faceless thing that doesn't even,506050.0,507849.0
8,"have a brand name in some cases, and",507850.0,510099.0
8,that all of them are essentially,510100.0,511029.0
8,equivalent to each other and it doesn't,511030.0,512139.0
8,"matter if you're using a 50 year old one,",512140.0,513639.0
8,"maybe it's better, even though it's going",513640.0,515199.0
8,to not have words from the past 50 years,515200.0,516668.0
8,and so on. And one of things I like to,516669.0,518559.0
8,but Kory's book is the way she talked,518560.0,519999.0
8,about this construction of authority in,520000.0,522038.0
8,terms of dictionaries,522039.0,524079.0
8,constructed that authority for,524080.0,525609.0
8,"themselves, like people didn't come out",525610.0,527499.0
8,of nowhere with this idea that the,527500.0,529089.0
8,dictionary was a thing you should look,529090.0,531009.0
8,"to for all your answers, that was in",531010.0,532929.0
8,"early dictionary ad campaigns,",532930.0,534969.0
8,Merriam-Webster and so on were,534970.0,537039.0
8,"using this to sell dictionaries, to say",537040.0,539379.0
8,this is where you should get all your,539380.0,541029.0
8,information like they have this ask the,541030.0,543069.0
8,editor feature you can work right in and,543070.0,545279.0
8,get answers on anything and that was,545280.0,548139.0
8,a big selling feature and Kory,548140.0,550089.0
8,tweets about some of the funny things,550090.0,551199.0
8,people ask her,551200.0,552189.0
8,"L: Kory has an excellent blog, I really",552190.0,554079.0
8,hope this book would be as excellent as,554080.0,556029.0
8,"the blog 'Harmless Drudgery', we'll put",556030.0,558099.0
8,"that in the show notes, she certainly has",558100.0,560769.0
8,a good approach to dealing with people's,560770.0,563289.0
8,ways of engaging with dictionaries G: yeah,563290.0,565809.0
8,she's got a really funny voice he's got,565810.0,567309.0
8,a great sense of humour and the book was,567310.0,568809.0
8,fun and I was basically positive I was,568810.0,570549.0
8,going to like it because I liked her,570550.0,572199.0
8,blog and Twitter so much L: yeah sorry,572200.0,574659.0
8,you thought this was a review episode it's,574660.0,576489.0
8,actually just a fangirl episode G: yeah!,576490.0,580299.0
8,It's one of those things where you try,580300.0,581889.0
8,to do a balanced review and you're like,581890.0,583149.0
8,"'oh these are the pros and cons',",583150.0,584529.0
8,"but there weren't any cons, because the book",584530.0,586419.0
8,"did exactly what it should do it, what it",586420.0,588489.0
8,"did was great, so that was good! L: so yeah",588490.0,592569.0
8,"they have this idea of authority, and you",592570.0,594729.0
8,know I personally just thought of,594730.0,596709.0
8,dictionaries as dictionaries,596710.0,597879.0
8,and I used whichever one my school gave,597880.0,600489.0
8,me. I think the social media,600490.0,602258.0
8,presence of dictionaries is actually,602259.0,603789.0
8,helping me feel like they have,603790.0,605049.0
8,personalities G: yeah I think I thought of,605050.0,607299.0
8,dictionaries as kind of like the,607300.0,608169.0
8,"periodic table, you know like",608170.0,610088.0
8,everyone has gotten this consensus - or,610089.0,612429.0
8,"like the phonebook, you know",612430.0,614499.0
8,"the phonebook just is, it's not like",614500.0,616719.0
8,someone had to sit down and decide. I,616720.0,618458.0
8,guess someone did decide who got each,618459.0,620169.0
8,number but that's not something that's,620170.0,621638.0
8,very transparent to you when you use the,621639.0,622958.0
8,phonebook.,622959.0,623469.0
8,They're both good if,623470.0,625599.0
8,you have a child and they need to be,625600.0,627068.0
8,propped up on a seat you can give them a,627069.0,628568.0
8,nice thick dictionary or phonebook to sit,628569.0,630249.0
8,"on, so that's useful",630250.0,631898.0
8,L: they have multiple functions! I feel like,631899.0,634388.0
8,sides a whole bunch of dictionary makers,634389.0,636129.0
8,that are like very sad at you right now for,636130.0,638439.0
8,"that G: no they sell copies, are you kidding",638440.0,640869.0
8,me?! They're all trying to increase,640870.0,642669.0
8,their print sales of the unabridged,642670.0,644888.0
8,version! L: I didn't really ever have,644889.0,648309.0
8,respect fully for lexicographers until I,648310.0,651129.0
8,had to make a dictionary as part of my,651130.0,654219.0
8,"work on Lamjung-Yolmo, which is a",654220.0,656708.0
8,Tibetan language that I worked on for my,656709.0,658689.0
8,PhD. People get really upset in,658690.0,661299.0
8,grant proposals and proper linguistic,661300.0,663638.0
8,stuff when I talk about it being a,663639.0,664929.0
8,dictionary because it is technically a,664930.0,666999.0
8,"'bilingual word list of translations',",667000.0,669898.0
8,but the thing is the,669899.0,672398.0
8,speakers of the language refer to it as,672399.0,674528.0
8,"a dictionary, it's as close to a",674529.0,676419.0
8,dictionary as anyone is going to write,676420.0,678638.0
8,for that language anytime soon G: so you,678639.0,681278.0
8,weren't defining the words in Yolmo?,681279.0,683018.0
8,L: yeah a dictionary should technically be,683019.0,684758.0
8,the word and then it's definition using,684759.0,687549.0
8,that language to define it G: I mean I have a,687550.0,690188.0
8,French-English dictionary and a German-English,690189.0,691989.0
8,dictionary and they still call,691990.0,693159.0
8,themselves dictionaries L: nooo they would be,693160.0,695229.0
8,'translation word lists' G: well you tell that,695230.0,698169.0
8,to Larousse L: yeah exactly,698170.0,700419.0
8,"to be honest, it's not like the forefront of",700420.0,703838.0
8,my skill set and there are definitely,703839.0,705578.0
8,like eight different entries that just,705579.0,707499.0
8,translate as 'green leafy edible,707500.0,710229.0
8,"vegetable', so that gave me a level of",710230.0,712958.0
8,respect for lexicography I didn't,712959.0,714969.0
8,have before G: so yeah when you're,714970.0,716409.0
8,writing a dictionary from scratch,716410.0,718028.0
8,how do you go about doing that? Do you just,718029.0,719258.0
8,"start writing down words you know,",719259.0,720789.0
8,"or do you go systematically, do you go in",720790.0,722888.0
8,"alphabetical order, how do you make",722889.0,724359.0
8,that? L: in terms of the one that I made?,724360.0,727838.0
8,G: yeah because in Kory's books she's,727839.0,729249.0
8,talking about how they go through the,729250.0,730568.0
8,"alphabet, but a lot of",730569.0,731619.0
8,what they're doing is they're revising,731620.0,732939.0
8,the definitions that already exists,732940.0,734769.0
8,because English has a several,734770.0,736389.0
8,hundred year tradition of dictionary,736390.0,737619.0
8,making and so dictionaries don't start,737620.0,739509.0
8,"from scratch anymore, they start from the",739510.0,741069.0
8,previous edition or from some previous,741070.0,742569.0
8,thing and they revise it and they update,742570.0,744189.0
8,it and so they have this kind of,744190.0,745838.0
8,"entrenched bureaucracy there already, but",745839.0,748269.0
8,I imagine if you're creating a,748270.0,749139.0
8,dictionary or word list from scratch,749140.0,750969.0
8,like where do you go from there? L: the thing,750970.0,752649.0
8,we made was definitely more ad hoc and,752650.0,754659.0
8,opportunistic. If you document a language,754660.0,757269.0
8,there are kind of some word lists that,757270.0,759159.0
8,people encourage you to use to,759160.0,761049.0
8,get the basic vocabulary and then a lot,761050.0,763359.0
8,of it came from stories and other texts,763360.0,765999.0
8,that we collected and some of them just,766000.0,768999.0
8,"came from, you know, they make a lot of",769000.0,770889.0
8,bamboo baskets so one day I just sat,770890.0,773139.0
8,there with one of the women and she was,773140.0,774519.0
8,making a basket,774520.0,775509.0
8,"I was like 'what's that called, what's that",775510.0,777309.0
8,called?' and I think it's probably like,777310.0,778778.0
8,the most irritating day of work she has,778779.0,780699.0
8,ever had G: but now all this basket,780700.0,782889.0
8,"vocabulary is documented L: yep,",782890.0,785169.0
8,"it's not comprehensive, I",785170.0,787778.0
8,think a lot of especially English,787779.0,789189.0
8,dictionaries kind of try and sell,789190.0,790539.0
8,themselves on their comprehensiveness,790540.0,792369.0
8,this is much more a kind of,792370.0,793659.0
8,opportunistic output of what was done,793660.0,795819.0
8,within the documentation G: and so then if,795820.0,797979.0
8,someone was trying to make a more,797980.0,799119.0
8,comprehensive dictionary they could use,799120.0,800439.0
8,that as a starting point and then,800440.0,802149.0
8,get some more and kind of keep building,802150.0,803619.0
8,on that L: yeah G: yea I've heard of people doing,803620.0,805449.0
8,things where you get a get a couple,805450.0,806739.0
8,speakers and you sit down and say okay,806740.0,807879.0
8,today we're going to talk about body,807880.0,809229.0
8,"parts, or today we're going to talk about",809230.0,810669.0
8,"family terms L: I also participated in,",810670.0,814389.0
8,"and I'll add a link to this as well, one time I",814390.0,817059.0
8,was in Nepal I spent a week watching a,817060.0,820389.0
8,"rapid words workshops, dictionary",820390.0,822939.0
8,"workshop, happen. Which is that they got",822940.0,824469.0
8,"40 speakers of Shuba, which is the",824470.0,826989.0
8,"language I work with at the moment, they",826990.0,829028.0
8,bought them all to a single place,829029.0,831549.0
8,together for two weeks. There's this very,831550.0,834129.0
8,very elaborate semantic set that gets,834130.0,836769.0
8,used and they were given all these,836770.0,838479.0
8,worksheets and it was like 'right today,838480.0,840399.0
8,name all the words in relation to house,840400.0,843729.0
8,"building, name all the words in relation",843730.0,846249.0
8,to women's clothing'. So they have,846250.0,848799.0
8,hundreds of semantic prompts G: and these,848800.0,851708.0
8,are things that most languages have,851709.0,853539.0
8,some words around? L: yeah sometimes they're,853540.0,855579.0
8,big like 'name all of the astrological,855580.0,858549.0
8,phenomena in the sky' and sometimes,858550.0,861099.0
8,they're really much more specific G: and I,861100.0,862809.0
8,guess it might depend you know if you,862810.0,864129.0
8,have a language,864130.0,865119.0
8,only spoken in a landlocked region they,865120.0,866588.0
8,probably don't have a lot of words to do with,866589.0,867638.0
8,the ocean L: yeah and so they ended up,867639.0,870698.0
8,"pulling together about 20,000 words, some",870699.0,873099.0
8,"of which were overlaps, but",873100.0,875679.0
8,within two weeks they built the guts of,875680.0,877448.0
8,"a dictionary, it was a very efficient",877449.0,879398.0
8,machine G: Wow.,879399.0,880268.0
8,And then so someone has to go through,880269.0,881438.0
8,and collate all those worksheets and,881439.0,882969.0
8,put them together and compare,882970.0,884619.0
8,all the words that everybody wrote down?,884620.0,886058.0
8,"L: they had a pool of people typing it up,",886059.0,888278.0
8,it was a kind of factory dictionary,888279.0,891369.0
8,"building, in a really cool way G: wow that's",891370.0,894039.0
8,really interesting L: I wrote an article,894040.0,895628.0
8,about that and I'll link to it in the,895629.0,897338.0
8,show notes. So for,897339.0,899768.0
8,those two examples the words that were getting in,899769.0,901838.0
8,"are just all of the words, we're",901839.0,903849.0
8,"kind of starting from scratch, we're",903850.0,905229.0
8,literally adding words like 'cat' and 'dog',905230.0,908169.0
8,"and 'person', and really basic vocabulary",908170.0,910539.0
8,G: and you might have a harder time with,910540.0,912039.0
8,even grammatical words or something like,912040.0,913448.0
8,that because they're like 'list,913449.0,914768.0
8,all the function words in your language',914769.0,916299.0
8,or like 'list all of the propositions in,916300.0,917888.0
8,your language'. I guess you could do,917889.0,919208.0
8,"prepositions, like you know 'list",919209.0,921429.0
8,all of the the particles' or something,921430.0,923438.0
8,"would be harder, you'd want to do a",923439.0,925448.0
8,grammatical description for that L: I mean,925449.0,927248.0
8,one thing you get a sense of from Cory's,927249.0,930039.0
8,book is that people who are trained to,930040.0,932349.0
8,do lexicography and dictionary editing,932350.0,935169.0
8,have a very finely tuned sense of,935170.0,937268.0
8,"language, and this is not what was",937269.0,939188.0
8,"happening, this was a very basic word",939189.0,940808.0
8,collection. But dictionary writers and,940809.0,943898.0
8,people who are figuring out definitions,943899.0,945609.0
8,have to kind of have a very finely tuned,945610.0,947528.0
8,sense of the slight differences between,947529.0,949568.0
8,"very similar words, or different senses",949569.0,952479.0
8,of a single word G: yeah I think the,952480.0,954039.0
8,"example Kory had was 'measly', it's like",954040.0,955808.0
8,measly is a small amount but it's also,955809.0,957578.0
8,"kind of small and mean, it's not a good",957579.0,960099.0
8,"small. So having those little bits,",960100.0,962799.0
8,"she called it's 'apocryphal', the German",962800.0,964508.0
8,word for the feeling of a language,964509.0,965859.0
8,and yeah I liked that. So Kory,965860.0,968528.0
8,walked us through the sense of how she,968529.0,970808.0
8,and Emily Brewster's defined a new sense of the,970809.0,972669.0
8,word 'a' as in 'an apple'...,972670.0,977588.0
8,"'a' as in 'a banana'! And you know, you",977589.0,982388.0
8,think you know approximately what this,982389.0,983708.0
8,word does and they noticed there was,983709.0,985359.0
8,another sense that it was doing and Emily,985360.0,987219.0
8,figured out exactly how to describe and,987220.0,988719.0
8,characterise the particular sense that hadn't,988720.0,990099.0
8,been described. So if you're doing very,990100.0,991928.0
8,initial dictionary building for a,991929.0,993938.0
8,language that doesn't have one you may not be,993939.0,995648.0
8,trying to catalogue all of the possible,995649.0,997479.0
8,"senses for every single word,",997480.0,999039.0
8,you're saying we need to kind of get,999040.0,1000539.0
8,down a word list as much as possible and,1000540.0,1003179.0
8,then we can work on refining it more,1003180.0,1004379.0
8,"later, there's a lot of different stages",1004380.0,1006089.0
8,L: yeah. But dictionaries at some point,1006090.0,1008189.0
8,become big enough that they have to kind,1008190.0,1009959.0
8,of start deciding- especially for a,1009960.0,1011549.0
8,language like English where there are so,1011550.0,1013049.0
8,many speakers in so many parts of the,1013050.0,1014849.0
8,world and English is used in so many,1014850.0,1016379.0
8,"domains, it's the language of",1016380.0,1018569.0
8,"day-to-day chat for people, it's a",1018570.0,1020489.0
8,"language of law, it's a language of",1020490.0,1022289.0
8,science it has a lot of domains in which,1022290.0,1024659.0
8,it operates and so it has a lot of,1024660.0,1026129.0
8,vocabulary that may not be in other,1026130.0,1029189.0
8,languages but that needs to be defined,1029190.0,1031439.0
8,G: yeah but which you might not want to,1031440.0,1033179.0
8,"have a standard dictionary, you may not want",1033180.0,1034469.0
8,to have every name of every possible,1034470.0,1036359.0
8,chemical compound in a small hand,1036360.0,1038609.0
8,"sized dictionary L:, yeah and like some",1038610.0,1040739.0
8,words that may have not been,1040740.0,1043109.0
8,updated for a long time suddenly become,1043110.0,1044939.0
8,"very topical, and suddenly need some",1044940.0,1047399.0
8,attention. There's a really nice quote,1047400.0,1048839.0
8,from Sue Butler back in 2012. in,1048840.0,1051359.0
8,Australia the word misogyny suddenly,1051360.0,1053669.0
8,became very topical because we had a,1053670.0,1056969.0
8,female prime minister who was trying to,1056970.0,1058799.0
8,call out some misogynistic behaviour G: she,1058800.0,1061439.0
8,"gave that great speech in Parliament, it was",1061440.0,1063029.0
8,good L: she did and Sue had a very busy,1063030.0,1066089.0
8,week because that was something that,1066090.0,1067889.0
8,people were looking up a lot. She said 'I,1067890.0,1069659.0
8,always think of myself as the person,1069660.0,1071279.0
8,with a mop and broom and a bucket coming,1071280.0,1072959.0
8,in and cleaning up after the party's,1072960.0,1074459.0
8,over.,1074460.0,1074789.0
8,In this case it was a fairly big party,1074790.0,1076559.0
8,and what was left on the floor was,1076560.0,1078089.0
8,misogyny'. So sometimes a word will become,1078090.0,1080279.0
8,popular again and a dictionary hasn't,1080280.0,1082289.0
8,really touched their definition for a,1082290.0,1083759.0
8,"while, or suddenly",1083760.0,1085699.0
8,lexicographers are being called on to,1085700.0,1087539.0
8,talk about these topics and that,1087540.0,1089909.0
8,"might kind of, a word that had been",1089910.0,1091319.0
8,neglected and not in an abridged,1091320.0,1093179.0
8,dictionary is suddenly an important and,1093180.0,1095219.0
8,useful word again,1095220.0,1096209.0
8,G: yeah like a politician will use an,1096210.0,1097949.0
8,obscure word in a speech or a,1097950.0,1100079.0
8,debate or something and everyone kind of,1100080.0,1102119.0
8,goes 'I know what that means but I'm not quite,1102120.0,1103109.0
8,sure let me go look that up' and then oh,1103110.0,1104849.0
8,we haven't touched the definition in 50,1104850.0,1106709.0
8,years,1106710.0,1106979.0
8,L: I do like Merriam-Webster will talk,1106980.0,1110129.0
8,about which words are trending in terms,1110130.0,1112739.0
8,of they haven't been looked up for a,1112740.0,1114389.0
8,while and suddenly people are and is,1114390.0,1116009.0
8,often related to something that is,1116010.0,1117479.0
8,happening G: yeah several of the dictionaries,1117480.0,1119189.0
8,do that it's great L: yeah and it's one of,1119190.0,1120989.0
8,the nice things about these new online,1120990.0,1123409.0
8,dictionaries and that they're using this,1123410.0,1125789.0
8,data of who's interacting and how,1125790.0,1127679.0
8,"they're interacting with a dictionary, I",1127680.0,1129149.0
8,find it so fascinating G: I think it's also,1129150.0,1130979.0
8,interesting because,1130980.0,1132089.0
8,when we made paper books and,1132090.0,1133559.0
8,sent them to people you had no idea what people,1133560.0,1134849.0
8,are looking at. Some of the earlier,1134850.0,1136739.0
8,earliest English dictionaries were like,1136740.0,1138269.0
8,"a table of hard words, so they wouldn't",1138270.0,1140039.0
8,even include the basic words because they were,1140040.0,1141449.0
8,like 'well everybody knows you know what,1141450.0,1143069.0
8,love is or what a mother is or something,1143070.0,1144869.0
8,like that we don't need to put that in,1144870.0,1146009.0
8,we're going to put you know,1146010.0,1146639.0
8,indefatigable or something like that in,1146640.0,1148529.0
8,our dictionaries because people look,1148530.0,1149609.0
8,"that up, it's hard' L: yeah G: indeFAtigable?",1149610.0,1151799.0
8,L: I don't know and you should look it up,1151800.0,1154469.0
8,in the dictionary to see how it's,1154470.0,1155549.0
8,pronounced G: yeah exactly!,1155550.0,1157139.0
8,But what they found is that when you put,1157140.0,1159659.0
8,"them online you can use stats, you",1159660.0,1161399.0
8,have you have visitor stats now and a,1161400.0,1163769.0
8,lot of people do look up words like 'love',1163770.0,1165599.0
8,and 'mother' and they wanna express their,1165600.0,1167819.0
8,feelings. Kind of,1167820.0,1171869.0
8,like you go to the drugstore and you,1171870.0,1173969.0
8,look through all the cards and try,1173970.0,1175619.0
8,to find something that really sums up,1175620.0,1176819.0
8,what you want to say about your feelings,1176820.0,1178889.0
8,for your mother sometimes people go to,1178890.0,1180209.0
8,the dictionary for that L: 'you are a good,1180210.0,1182129.0
8,female parent' G: or on Valentine's Day they,1182130.0,1184379.0
8,look up what love is because they want,1184380.0,1185819.0
8,the dictionary to put that into words,1185820.0,1186809.0
8,for them - which I don't think the,1186810.0,1188759.0
8,"lexicographers are really, like",1188760.0,1190439.0
8,they don't think of themselves as,1190440.0,1191579.0
8,"greeting card writers, they're just",1191580.0,1193289.0
8,trying to describe how people are,1193290.0,1194369.0
8,already using the word rather than give,1194370.0,1196769.0
8,you a nice pithy thing to put in your,1196770.0,1198749.0
8,greeting cards L: I mean that's probably a,1198750.0,1201179.0
8,very obvious point that we maybe just,1201180.0,1203819.0
8,"need to make very explicit, and that",1203820.0,1205739.0
8,dictionary makers are still trying to,1205740.0,1207329.0
8,make explicit after years of claiming,1207330.0,1209249.0
8,"themselves to be the authority, but a",1209250.0,1211199.0
8,"dictionary is being descriptive, it's",1211200.0,1213239.0
8,describing how people are using language,1213240.0,1215489.0

8,is going to be related to the topic of,1659659.0,1661189.0
8,her next book about how dictionaries go,1661190.0,1662928.0
8,about defining colour terms which if you,1662929.0,1665089.0

8,episode you can go listen to about defining colours,1673340.0,1675408.0
8,L: and the challenges there. And I think,1675409.0,1677058.0
8,that's also something that's important,1677059.0,1679009.0
8,to mention is that the way words work in,1679010.0,1681229.0

8,work in your brain.,1683419.0,1684949.0
8,I mean dictionaries have an important,1684950.0,1686808.0

8,"understanding of the meaning of words,",1689240.0,1691129.0

9,"about sounds like the IPA episode, and",295039.0,296749.0
9,we've definitely not stopped talking,296750.0,298309.0

9,big macro society end and talking about,304280.0,306799.0
9,"language and world peace, or kids role in",306800.0,309109.0
9,"language change, but haven't talked about",309110.0,311059.0

9,does that transition happen? And this is,316940.0,318559.0
9,"a bigger question for one episode, but we're",318560.0,320299.0
9,going to start with that L: and so I think,320300.0,322068.0
9,"it's important, even though we talk about",322069.0,323869.0
9,sound a lot and we talk about words a,323870.0,326119.0
9,"lot, but languages aren't just lists of",326120.0,329089.0
9,"words, so you need something more than",329090.0,331698.0
9,words here G: okay I think languages can be,331699.0,333978.0
9,a list of words because have you ever,333979.0,335239.0
9,seen those movie cuts where they put all,335240.0,338508.0

9,the most excellent use of somebody's,343190.0,346008.0
9,"time, it's so good G: this is like those",346009.0,348019.0

9,all the tomatoes and the pieces,349580.0,351649.0
9,of radish in pretty patterns rather than,351650.0,354499.0
9,in a tossed salad L: but in this in this case,354500.0,356749.0
9,it's alphabetical patterns G: it's,356750.0,358549.0
9,alphabetical patterns. So there's 'Of Oz,358550.0,360829.0
9,"the Wizard', which was some guy who put",360830.0,363499.0
9,"all of the words in The Wizard of Oz in order,",363500.0,364968.0
9,so it starts out with 'a' and then,364969.0,367399.0
9,gradually works its way down to,367400.0,368568.0
9,"'wizard, wizard, wizard L: and there's also a",368569.0,371179.0

9,them or if you just want to experience,383180.0,384649.0

9,"it's not just about the words next door,",408020.0,409848.0
9,so you can't just look at one word and,409849.0,411469.0
9,"what is immediately next to it, this",411470.0,413508.0
9,structure and the constituency is,413509.0,415758.0
9,happening across bigger relationships,415759.0,418128.0
9,and groups of words,418129.0,419568.0
9,yeah there's units of words that aren't,419569.0,421489.0
9,"always obvious from what's next door, and",421490.0,423378.0
9,"my favourite example of this, best example,",423379.0,426469.0
9,"is the phrase 'time flies like an arrow',",426470.0,429769.0
9,which with the corollary 'fruit flies,429770.0,432709.0
9,"like a banana' L: it still just, it's just so",432710.0,436999.0
9,perfect G: it's so beautiful L: I know we,437000.0,439549.0
9,have this problem sometimes with,439550.0,441158.0
9,linguistics where if you've done one,441159.0,443209.0
9,intro to linguistics course you've done,443210.0,444888.0
9,a few because everyone uses the same,444889.0,446478.0
9,"anecdote, but there's just something so",446479.0,448129.0
9,perfectly constructed about this,448130.0,450469.0
9,structural ambiguity G: yeah so somehow I,450470.0,452959.0
9,don't know if you've missed the,452960.0,453918.0
9,ambiguity or if you just want to hear it,453919.0,455689.0
9,"explained to you, 'time flies like an arrow'",455690.0,457339.0
9,refers to time which is a thing that,457340.0,460668.0
9,"flies like an arrow flies, whereas 'fruit",460669.0,464059.0
9,flies like a banana' does not mean that,464060.0,465709.0
9,apples and oranges and pears all soar,465710.0,468918.0
9,across the room in the same way that,468919.0,470568.0
9,"banana soars across the room, which maybe",470569.0,472309.0
9,"they do, but it refers to fruit flies",472310.0,475038.0
9,which are kind of flies who are fond of,475039.0,478698.0
9,bananas L: so in the first sentence 'time' is,478699.0,481579.0
9,the thing that is doing something and in,481580.0,484369.0
9,the second sentence 'fruit flies' are the,484370.0,487038.0
9,"thing that is doing something, so the",487039.0,489019.0
9,sentences are being cut up in,489020.0,491059.0
9,different ways and that gives them their,491060.0,492948.0
9,different readings G: or to use the,492949.0,495138.0
9,terminology that we're introducing in,495139.0,496519.0
9,"this episode, 'time' is constituent by",496520.0,499098.0
9,"itself, well all words are constituents by",499099.0,501049.0
9,themselves which is not terribly,501050.0,501978.0
9,"interesting, but 'time flies' is not a",501979.0,504649.0
9,"constituent by itself, the 'flies' part",504650.0,506899.0
9,goes with the 'like an arrow part'. Where as,506900.0,508788.0
9,in the second sentence 'fruit flies' is,508789.0,510679.0
9,constituent by itself and then the 'like a,510680.0,512658.0
9,banana' part is also another type of,512659.0,514578.0
9,constituent. So how you group the words,514579.0,516429.0
9,even when 'flies' and 'like',516430.0,520458.0
9,"are the same in both sentences, how",520459.0,522199.0
9,you group them is what's changing the,522200.0,523759.0
9,meaning there. So there's another example,523760.0,525679.0
9,of structural ambiguity which is from,525680.0,528588.0
9,"the BBC radio drama 'Cabin Pressure',",528589.0,531049.0
9,which is hilarious and you should all listen,531050.0,533088.0
9,"to it, but in one case one of the",533089.0,534739.0
9,characters says 'oh I know what's going,534740.0,537198.0
9,"on, I went on a course on understanding",537199.0,539629.0
9,people in Ipswich' and the other,539630.0,541378.0
9,character says 'well if I ever want the,541379.0,543208.0
9,"people of Ipswich understood, I'll let",543209.0,545368.0
9,you know',545369.0,545878.0
9,L: so I had the 'understanding people in,545879.0,549898.0
9,Ipswich' as one constituent in my head,549899.0,552838.0
9,"when I first read that, I wasn't reading it",552839.0,554998.0
9,"very carefully, on your you had a blog",554999.0,557698.0
9,"post about it which we'll link to,3 and I",557699.0,559918.0
9,was like 'why would you need to? Is it a,559919.0,561538.0
9,dialect thing that people in Ipswich have?',561539.0,563458.0
9,so I completely fell for that G: yeah you completely got,563459.0,566488.0
9,"the wrong interpretation, so obviously",566489.0,568228.0
9,there are generic courses of,568229.0,569698.0
9,"understanding people and some of them,",569699.0,571108.0
9,"one assumes, happen in Ipswich, but in",571109.0,573658.0
9,this case the character is deliberately,573659.0,575158.0
9,misinterpreting the other one saying,575159.0,577108.0
9,'well yeah that's fine to the people of,577109.0,579178.0
9,"Ipswich, but what about the person in",579179.0,581368.0
9,front of us right now who's not,581369.0,582898.0
9,from Ipswich?' L: a couple of years ago,582899.0,584998.0
9,you had the Lingvids video series and,584999.0,588268.0
9,you did a little bit of demonstrating,588269.0,590698.0
9,how these constituents can move around,590699.0,594148.0
9,and be analysed in relation to each other G: yeah,594149.0,596608.0
9,so we did a series of a videos before I,596609.0,598798.0
9,decided to become an audio person rather,598799.0,600418.0
9,"than a video person, and one of the",600419.0,602638.0
9,questions that we asked for the,602639.0,604408.0
9,purpose of the video is 'is a sentence,604409.0,606988.0
9,more like a bracelet or like a mobile?'. So,606989.0,609658.0
9,you can think of a couple analogies for,609659.0,611338.0
9,how a sentence works and in a bracelet,611339.0,614219.0
9,analogy you think of okay if the words,614220.0,616618.0
9,in the sentence are kind of like beads,616619.0,617849.0
9,on a string the way we see a sentence,617850.0,619768.0
9,written on a page and it's just flat,619769.0,621088.0
9,and there the one word and the beads can only,621089.0,624058.0
9,really notice or are influenced by the,624059.0,626368.0
9,beads directly next to them because,626369.0,627719.0
9,"that's all that's there that's touching them,",627720.0,629158.0
9,there's just one string that runs,629159.0,630508.0
9,through the whole thing. Whereas if you,630509.0,632038.0
9,"make a mobile, like a hanging mobile from",632039.0,633778.0
9,a ceiling - some people say mobile - then,633779.0,635638.0
9,you have stuff hanging off of stuff and,635639.0,637948.0
9,then some of the bits that hang off has,637949.0,640018.0
9,other things hanging on from them and so,640019.0,641788.0
9,there's dependencies and there's,641789.0,642928.0
9,relationships between some of the parts,642929.0,645388.0
9,of the tree or some of the parts of the,645389.0,646948.0
9,"structure that are groups that can have,",646949.0,649618.0
9,"you know you could say something, like",649619.0,651568.0
9,if you have something like a course on,651569.0,652648.0
9,"understanding people in Ipswich, is it a",652649.0,654808.0
9,course on understanding people and the,654809.0,656578.0
9,"whole course is in Ipswich, so 'in Ipswich'",656579.0,658648.0
9,and 'course on understanding,658649.0,660418.0
9,people' both hang off the two parts at,660419.0,662518.0
9,"the top of a mobile, or is it 'a course on",662519.0,664738.0
9,understanding people in Ipswich' in which,664739.0,667408.0
9,case 'people' and 'in Ipswich' are hanging,667409.0,670048.0
9,off the same bit and 'the course on,670049.0,671849.0
9,understanding people' is all the way at,671850.0,673228.0
9,"the top, so there's ways of",673229.0,674929.0
9,thinking of how to group things. So,674930.0,676489.0
9,"that's the video that you can watch, it's a",676490.0,677629.0
9,little bit easier. You can't see me but,677630.0,679338.0
9,I'm gesturing! L: there's ways of thinking,679339.0,681799.0
9,about things but conveniently in videos,681800.0,683869.0
9,there are also ways of seeing things to go,683870.0,686569.0
9,"with that explanation, so that's on the",686570.0,688099.0
9,Lingvid videos G: and we'll link to that,688100.0,690439.0
9,too. And the fancy words that linguists,690440.0,692449.0
9,give this particular type of,692450.0,693499.0
9,constituents where there's two different,693500.0,695028.0
9,meanings or more than one different,695029.0,696349.0
9,"meaning is structural ambiguity, but",696350.0,697759.0
9,we're going to we're going to stick with,697760.0,698929.0
9,introducing one new term at a time so,698930.0,700849.0
9,you don't have to remember structural,700850.0,701898.0
9,ambiguity if you want to L: and you've,701899.0,704059.0
9,talked about some metaphors,704060.0,706879.0
9,like bracelets or mobiles for how,706880.0,709729.0
9,constituents can relate to each other,709730.0,711708.0
9,G: some people also use the idea of,711709.0,713599.0
9,nesting dolls inside each other for,713600.0,715729.0
9,"constituents, or bowls that get bigger and",715730.0,717919.0
9,bigger and nest in each other. A problem,717920.0,719239.0
9,"that I have with that, and I get",719240.0,721009.0
9,"that stuff nests, is that it's hard to",721010.0,723499.0
9,"account for several things happening at once,",723500.0,725569.0
9,"it's very linear, there's only",725570.0,727159.0
9,one set of layers as you go,727160.0,728989.0
9,out and that's not what generally,728990.0,730819.0
9,"happens with sentences, there's generally",730820.0,731958.0
9,more than one kind of set so I thought,731959.0,733729.0
9,of a new-age metaphor which I am very,733730.0,736309.0
9,proud to share with you guys. So this is,736310.0,738319.0
9,a cooking metaphor L: yes! I'm on board,738320.0,741139.0
9,already G: so if you're making a cake you have,741140.0,743359.0
9,"a set of steps to follow, so",743360.0,745789.0
9,you cream the butter and the sugar and,745790.0,746989.0
9,then you add the eggs and you add the,746990.0,748458.0
9,"vanilla, and then you go over to another",748459.0,750289.0
9,bowl and you have the flour and you have,750290.0,752958.0
9,the baking powder and you have the salt,752959.0,754549.0
9,and the cinnamon or something,754550.0,756079.0
9,if you want it and you mix those,756080.0,757579.0
9,together and then you add the one bowl,757580.0,759588.0
9,to the other bowl and then sometimes you,759589.0,761929.0
9,also add pre-prepared ingredients like,761930.0,763999.0
9,"chocolate chips which also have stuff in them,",764000.0,765979.0
9,they have cocoa butter L: what are,765980.0,768439.0
9,"constituted of, hmmm... G: and so there's",768440.0,770449.0
9,several different kind of subroutines or,770450.0,773028.0
9,sub bowls or sub containers that you,773029.0,775549.0
9,"need to take care of separately, and each",775550.0,777588.0
9,of those has a particular order that,777589.0,779028.0
9,you're adding stuff in and then also,779029.0,780169.0
9,sometimes you have to go to this other,780170.0,781369.0
9,bowl and do stuff. Or when I make cream,781370.0,784189.0
9,"cheese brownies, which is a recipe",784190.0,785479.0
9,"that I like a lot,",785480.0,786139.0
9,you make the brownie stuff and then you,786140.0,787939.0
9,have to make the cream cheese mixture,787940.0,788778.0
9,and you add the sugar to the cream,788779.0,790159.0
9,cheese and stuff and then you swirl,790160.0,791989.0
9,"the cream cheese mixture on top, so you",791990.0,793519.0
9,have several bowls going on so it's,793520.0,796609.0
9,"not just one set of nesting bowls,",796610.0,798409.0
9,it's like when you do stuff L: and exactly,798410.0,801349.0
9,the same ingredients you use for your,801350.0,803929.0
9,"cream cheese brownies, I might use to",803930.0,806059.0
9,make chocolate,806060.0,807899.0
9,chip cookies G: with cream cheese icing L: with,807900.0,810569.0
9,"cream cheese icing, I don't do that but G: I",810570.0,812999.0
9,don't know if anyone has but it's all good,813000.0,814889.0
9,L: some kind of weird biscuit/,814890.0,816779.0
9,sandwich... I mean it wouldn't be as tasty,816780.0,820229.0
9,but it would be still a valid use of the,820230.0,822449.0
9,same set of material G: I think we need to,822450.0,824459.0
9,determine this empirically and have a,824460.0,825749.0
9,"bake-off L: okay, I have not made that recipe",825750.0,828299.0
9,before so I feel that I'm at something,828300.0,829949.0
9,of a disadvantage.,829950.0,830789.0
9,"All novel baked goods, all novel",830790.0,833909.0
9,utterances. So in the same way that I can,833910.0,836219.0
9,use exactly the same ingredients to make,836220.0,837989.0
9,"banana pancakes or banana muffins, but",837990.0,841439.0
9,the order in which you pull,841440.0,843929.0
9,them together creates something different,843930.0,846179.0
9,G: and what you put in first and what you,846180.0,847859.0
9,"mix separately, or",847860.0,850499.0
9,something like a sauce or something,850500.0,852479.0
9,you make the salad and then you,852480.0,854609.0
9,make the salad dressing and you mix the,854610.0,855989.0
9,salad dressing in its own bowl and then,855990.0,857669.0
9,you can pour it over the salad as one,857670.0,859079.0
9,"thing, that's different from",859080.0,861029.0
9,making a salad where you throw the salad,861030.0,862679.0
9,dressing in with all the other,862680.0,863729.0
9,ingredients all separately. And so,863730.0,865769.0
9,what that's getting at is,865770.0,867179.0
9,if you have 'time flies like an arrow' you,867180.0,869519.0
9,can just kind of add each one - 'time',869520.0,871919.0
9,"gets added to 'flies like an arrow', 'flies'",871920.0,874439.0
9,"gets added to 'flies... like an arrow', 'like'",874440.0,876989.0
9,gets added to 'an arrow'. But if you have,876990.0,878969.0
9,something like 'fruit flies like a banana',878970.0,880529.0
9,you've got to combine 'fruit' and 'flies',880530.0,882539.0
9,together first L: I have a bowl of fruit,882540.0,885509.0
9,flies here Gretchen! G: this is my,885510.0,888059.0
9,"baking, I'm really good at baking! L: mmm protein",888060.0,892589.0
9,G: so if you have fruit flies or raisins or,892590.0,894539.0
9,something that you want to put in your,894540.0,896609.0
9,"bananas, you have to combine fruit and",896610.0,898109.0
9,flies together as words before you can,898110.0,900449.0
9,add that whole thing to 'like a banana',900450.0,903049.0
9,L: yeah I just want to suggest for a moment,903050.0,906809.0
9,that maybe some of the more attentive,906810.0,909449.0
9,listeners are wondering if we're not,909450.0,911819.0
9,just talking about something that they,911820.0,913649.0
9,think of as grammar G: I think grammar is,913650.0,915839.0
9,"often used imprecisely, and so",915840.0,917849.0
9,constituency is a specific thing,917850.0,919739.0
9,"within the idea of grammar, so yeah this",919740.0,922619.0
9,is this is partially grammar but it's,922620.0,924749.0
9,useful to divide that up into specific,924750.0,926729.0
9,"ideas L: yep, so this is one particular",926730.0,929389.0
9,part of putting together words to create,929390.0,932849.0
9,meanings G: I thought you were going to say,932850.0,934379.0
9,'I think some of our more astute,934380.0,936359.0
9,listeners are you wondering if we're not,936360.0,937499.0
9,"talking about politics', because",937500.0,938789.0
9,constituency is also a thing in politics,938790.0,940979.0
9,L: sorry for anyone who found this thinking,940980.0,944159.0
9,it was a politics podcast,944160.0,945088.0
9,G: not a politics podcast. So electoral,945089.0,947999.0
9,"districts are also constituencies, and a",948000.0,950309.0
9,constituent is a person who lives in an,950310.0,951778.0
9,electoral district. And they come from,951779.0,953849.0
9,"the same metaphor, they're related to the",953850.0,955799.0
9,"word 'constitute', so a person who is a",955800.0,957778.0
9,constituent decides who constitutes,957779.0,960208.0
9,their Parliament or their Congress or,960209.0,962278.0
9,their set of representatives in politics.,962279.0,964379.0
9,So they're related but they're not the,964380.0,966629.0
9,same thing L: so we've been talking about,966630.0,968909.0
9,this as though it just objectively,968910.0,971189.0
9,"exists, but how do we know constituency",971190.0,974969.0
9,exists other than you talking about,974970.0,976799.0
9,bowls and other metaphors? G: also I,976800.0,979349.0
9,think how if you can't create one of,979350.0,981869.0
9,these ambiguities that prove very nicely,981870.0,984028.0
9,"that something is going on, but",984029.0,985528.0
9,obviously not all sentences are,985529.0,986669.0
9,"ambiguous, and so how do you",986670.0,988679.0
9,do this? The cool thing is that there,988680.0,990809.0
9,"are totally ways to do this, there is",990810.0,993539.0
9,totes science guys! L: this is us getting,993540.0,996809.0
9,our linguist lab coats on G: so you know how,996810.0,999659.0
9,in chemistry you can add drops of a,999660.0,1002838.0
9,known chemical to a mystery liquid,1002839.0,1004789.0
9,and see if it turns green or something - I,1004790.0,1006169.0
9,"don't know very much about chemistry, this",1006170.0,1009619.0
9,is what all the scientists do in the,1009620.0,1010759.0
9,movies L: these are definitely not chemistry,1010760.0,1012979.0
9,lab coats people G: and it'll tell you like,1012980.0,1014509.0
9,if it turns purple it'll tell you,1014510.0,1015679.0
9,whether it's an acid or a base or,1015680.0,1017119.0
9,something like this. So there is stuff,1017120.0,1019219.0
9,you can add to sentences that's known,1019220.0,1022159.0
9,quantities that behaves in certain,1022160.0,1024198.0
9,ways around constituents and then see what,1024199.0,1026389.0
9,"happens, and see whether a particular",1026390.0,1028399.0
9,piece of a new sentence is a constituent,1028400.0,1030708.0
9,or not L: so we don't have something like a,1030709.0,1034219.0
9,Large Hadron Collider to show,1034220.0,1036349.0
9,you around G: Large Hadron constituencer!,1036350.0,1040448.0
9,"L: yep, unfortunately we haven't built one",1040449.0,1043219.0
9,of those to smash words and phrases,1043220.0,1046369.0
9,"into each other, but that's why",1046370.0,1048949.0
9,"linguistics is really cool, because",1048950.0,1050449.0
9,you don't even need the imaginary lab,1050450.0,1052489.0
9,"coats that we're wearing right now, you",1052490.0,1054439.0
9,just need some linguistic intuitions and,1054440.0,1058369.0
9,you can do the science G: you can do,1058370.0,1060079.0
9,"science right there in your ears, in your",1060080.0,1062449.0
9,"mouth, in your talking L: in the privacy of",1062450.0,1064939.0
9,your own mouth G: in the privacy of your,1064940.0,1067099.0
9,"own home, you too can do the science, you",1067100.0,1069589.0
9,don't need test tubes or safety,1069590.0,1071539.0
9,goggles L: try this as home,1071540.0,1074479.0
9,"G: try this at home, do",1074480.0,1074869.0
9,try this at home it's okay it won't,1074870.0,1076519.0
9,break anything L: other than some rules of,1076520.0,1079489.0
9,constituency G: no constituents were harmed,1079490.0,1081139.0
9,in the making of this experiment L: so,1081140.0,1083329.0
9,there are a whole range of constituency,1083330.0,1086359.0
9,tests that linguists use to figure out,1086360.0,1089419.0
9,whether something as a constituent or,1089420.0,1090829.0
9,not and these are often language,1090830.0,1092989.0
9,"dependent, some of them you can use in a",1092990.0,1095209.0
9,"lot of languages, others are really",1095210.0,1097159.0
9,"specific to a particular language, and",1097160.0,1099859.0
9,there are some good videos and,1099860.0,1102169.0
9,actually the Wikipedia,1102170.0,1103789.0
9,summary for this is pretty good as a,1103790.0,1105589.0
9,"starting point, so we're not going to go",1105590.0,1107299.0
9,through all of the main tests for,1107300.0,1109219.0
9,"English constituency testing, but we are",1109220.0,1111799.0
9,going to share a couple to give you an,1111800.0,1113359.0
9,idea of how it works G: yeah and we will,1113360.0,1115099.0
9,link to more lists so if you think 'I,1115100.0,1116749.0
9,want to test this'. The core idea of a,1116750.0,1119359.0
9,constituency test is you want to say,1119360.0,1121579.0
9,'I've got a sentence and I've got a,1121580.0,1125029.0
9,couple words in this sentence' - so any,1125030.0,1127339.0
9,individual word is going to be a,1127340.0,1128629.0
9,constituent because you could say it by,1128630.0,1130369.0
9,itself if you want so that's not very,1130370.0,1131689.0
9,"interesting, but you've got two",1131690.0,1133549.0
9,"words or three words or five words, a",1133550.0,1135409.0
9,string of words in the sentence and you,1135410.0,1137178.0
9,want to say 'are these words functioning,1137179.0,1139579.0
9,together as a unit or is there,1139580.0,1142579.0
9,some break between them?'. And the,1142580.0,1144319.0
9,whole sentence is also going to be a,1144320.0,1145489.0
9,constituent but within a sentence you're,1145490.0,1147319.0
9,going to have some groups of words that,1147320.0,1148969.0
9,are more influenced by each other,1148970.0,1150139.0
9,"and some that aren't, and so what we're",1150140.0,1151639.0
9,doing is saying 'okay there's various,1151640.0,1153769.0
9,ways of saying here's a group of words,1153770.0,1155389.0
9,that we're wondering about let's put it,1155390.0,1157759.0
9,through a bunch of other contexts where,1157760.0,1160519.0
9,we know that things that our units do,1160520.0,1163999.0
9,act together and if this one does that,1164000.0,1167178.0
9,"too then it is a constituent, and if it",1167179.0,1169669.0
9,doesn't do that too then it's not' L: so we,1169670.0,1172759.0
9,need a test subject G: I think we should,1172760.0,1175729.0
9,"use 'time flies like an arrow, fruit flies",1175730.0,1177558.0
9,like a banana' L: okay that is a very,1177559.0,1179989.0
9,excellent set of guinea pigs to bring,1179990.0,1183469.0
9,into the lab space G: because this will give us,1183470.0,1185928.0
9,some contrast. We've kind of spoiled it for,1185929.0,1187729.0
9,"you already, but we want to find out if",1187730.0,1189109.0
9,"'time flies' is a constituent, and we will",1189110.0,1191749.0
9,also want to see if 'fruit flies' is a,1191750.0,1193339.0
9,constituent L: so the first test that we,1193340.0,1195649.0
9,are going to subject them to is the,1195650.0,1197269.0
9,"questions test, which is more or less",1197270.0,1198829.0
9,using questions to see if they can stand,1198830.0,1202009.0
9,"alone, because often if you ask someone a",1202010.0,1204079.0
9,question they just answer with a stand,1204080.0,1206989.0
9,"alone response,",1206990.0,1207969.0
9,so if you say to someone 'what did you do,1207970.0,1209949.0
9,last night?' they don't say 'last night I,1209950.0,1212529.0
9,went to the cinema' they just say 'I went,1212530.0,1214539.0
9,to the cinema' G: you can answer with a,1214540.0,1216039.0
9,fragment and those fragments are all,1216040.0,1218109.0
9,constituents. So if we say 'what likes a,1218110.0,1220869.0
9,banana?' we can answer that with 'fruit,1220870.0,1223779.0
9,"flies', but if we say 'what likes an",1223780.0,1226959.0
9,"arrow?', we don't want to answer that 'time",1226960.0,1229269.0
9,"flies', or like we could but it would be",1229270.0,1231639.0
9,something very very different and so,1231640.0,1233409.0
9,this is telling us that 'fruit flies' is a,1233410.0,1235629.0
9,"constituent, you can use it as an answer",1235630.0,1237039.0
9,to a question and 'time flies' is not a,1237040.0,1239169.0
9,constituent. But if we say 'what flies like,1239170.0,1242319.0
9,an arrow?' we can just answer that 'time',1242320.0,1243909.0
9,and that's totally fine. So sometime you need to,1243910.0,1246639.0
9,think creative about what that question needs to be,1246640.0,1248159.0
9,L: yeah where as what 'what flies like a,1248160.0,1250659.0
9,banana?' is literally only a banana.,1250660.0,1252969.0
9,Another test that we could subject them,1252970.0,1255159.0
9,to is the test of substitution G: so,1255160.0,1258099.0
9,this means because we know that any,1258100.0,1260609.0
9,"individual word is a constituent, if you",1260610.0,1263349.0
9,can find an individual word that you can,1263350.0,1265599.0
9,substitute for a longer string of words,1265600.0,1268239.0
9,"that you're wondering about, then that",1268240.0,1269799.0
9,means that this longer string of words,1269800.0,1271179.0
9,"has to also be constituent, as long as",1271180.0,1273009.0
9,the sentence keeps doing the,1273010.0,1274659.0
9,same thing L: so for example you could say,1274660.0,1276849.0
9,'I like cake' or you could say 'the very,1276850.0,1280779.0
9,"beautiful, intelligent woman who has just",1280780.0,1284109.0
9,finished her job in London and is moving,1284110.0,1286299.0
9,back to Melbourne to do a new job likes,1286300.0,1289509.0
9,"cake'. Although the second one is very,",1289510.0,1292119.0
9,very long it fills basically exactly the,1292120.0,1294789.0
9,same role in the sentence as the one,1294790.0,1297159.0
9,letter pronoun 'I' and in this case just,1297160.0,1300699.0
9,semantically happens to be the,1300700.0,1302529.0
9,same person! G: happens to be true!,1302530.0,1304199.0
9,yeah so often people use pronouns,1304200.0,1306849.0
9,"for this, you can substitute the entire",1306850.0,1308409.0
9,thing with a pronoun. So if we take our,1308410.0,1310269.0
9,'time flies' example if we say 'time flies,1310270.0,1312759.0
9,like an arrow' you could also say 'it flies like,1312760.0,1315759.0
9,an arrow' but if we want to say 'is 'time,1315760.0,1318039.0
9,flies' a constituent?' then you have to say 'it,1318040.0,1320169.0
9,likes a banana' or 'they like a banana',1320170.0,1322419.0
9,L: 'they like an arrow?'. We've got,1322420.0,1325239.0
9,cross contamination on the sentences,1325240.0,1327459.0
9,"G: so hard to do orally! yeah the arrow, and if",1327460.0,1330279.0
9,that's supposed to mean the same thing a,1330280.0,1331659.0
9,'time flies like a' we're dealing with,1331660.0,1333309.0
9,"little flapping Timelords, we're not",1333310.0,1335139.0
9,dealing with time flying. Where as,1335140.0,1337869.0
9,for 'fruit flies like a banana' if you,1337870.0,1339759.0
9,"have 'it flies like a banana',",1339760.0,1341739.0
9,again you've created a very different,1341740.0,1343178.0
9,sentence where you're talking about,1343179.0,1344259.0
9,"something that is thrown across the room,",1344260.0,1345789.0
9,whereas 'they like a banana' is a,1345790.0,1348099.0
9,reasonable and cogent substitute for,1348100.0,1350558.0
9,'fruit flies like bananas',1350559.0,1351999.0
9,L: there is also another thing that is not,1352000.0,1354939.0
9,part of the standard canon of,1354940.0,1357419.0
9,"constituency tests, but I like it as a",1357420.0,1360759.0
9,way of showing that anyone who,1360760.0,1363789.0
9,uses the internet know instinctively,1363790.0,1366308.0
9,"what a constituent is, and that's because",1366309.0,1369009.0
9,when we use hyperlinks and clickable,1369010.0,1371949.0
9,links on the internet,1371950.0,1373329.0
9,we rarely break constituent boundaries,1373330.0,1376329.0
9,"with those, we usually have a single",1376330.0,1378879.0
9,constituent or a phrase within a single hyperlink,1378880.0,1382149.0
9,G: so this is like the anchor text for a,1382150.0,1383859.0
9,"hyperlink, so when you you",1383860.0,1384909.0
9,highlight a couple words and then you,1384910.0,1386949.0
9,"like make them into a link, and the words",1386950.0,1388808.0
9,that you highlighted are probably,1388809.0,1390609.0
9,"constituent, you're probably already doing",1390610.0,1392169.0
9,"this subconsciously L: so you would say, if",1392170.0,1395558.0
9,you were writing about 'time flies like,1395559.0,1398019.0
9,an arrow' you might have a hyperlink for,1398020.0,1399789.0
9,'time' and that would take you to a,1399790.0,1401769.0
9,dictionary definition of time and you,1401770.0,1403839.0
9,might have 'flies like an arrow' might be,1403840.0,1406389.0
9,a hyperlink to a video that shows an,1406390.0,1408279.0
9,arrows flying. Whereas if you have the,1408280.0,1410949.0
9,other sentence you might have seen like,1410950.0,1412269.0
9,'fruit flies' and that takes you to the,1412270.0,1414099.0
9,Wikipedia page for fruit flies and you,1414100.0,1416499.0
9,might have 'like a banana' and then you,1416500.0,1418839.0
9,have a list of animals that eat fruit,1418840.0,1420939.0
9,G: but you'd be unlikely probably to make,1420940.0,1423279.0
9,'time flies' the anchor text of your of,1423280.0,1425619.0
9,"your hyperlink, unless you're talking",1425620.0,1427239.0
9,"about Timelords flies, which in which",1427240.0,1428769.0
9,case it would be a constituent L: yeah and it,1428770.0,1430569.0
9,"would be very, very unlikely to get",1430570.0,1432249.0
9,something like 'time flies like' G: oh yeah that'd be,1432250.0,1434678.0
9,"really weird. But it's surprisingly common,",1434679.0,1436329.0

9,"talking about constituency, because what",1489230.0,1491629.0
9,this dog characters does on this Twitter,1491630.0,1493789.0
9,"account, which we're definitely going to link to",1493790.0,1495109.0
9,you should definitely go check out,1495110.0,1496159.0
9,"because it's really funny, is the seed of",1496160.0,1499369.0
9,the account is words in all,1499370.0,1501379.0

9,"words, sometimes he'll even go up to like four",1508550.0,1510589.0

9,rhythm of a wagging tail or like you,1514010.0,1516079.0
9,know dogs aren't super smart,1516080.0,1518679.0
9,"linguistically, so they'll kind of pause",1518680.0,1520669.0
9,a lot and what's really interesting to,1520670.0,1523069.0
9,me is that the pauses often obey,1523070.0,1526009.0
9,constituency boundaries. I'm sure this,1526010.0,1527569.0
9,"guy knows no linguistics, I don't think",1527570.0,1529219.0
9,he's doing it consciously L: but even,1529220.0,1530929.0
9,intuitively it's falling into constituency. I,1530930.0,1533299.0
9,mean I can read a couple of examples but,1533300.0,1535249.0
9,it does take us into the always,1535250.0,1536629.0
9,difficult territory of how written memes,1536630.0,1538549.0
9,sound out loud G: I think we should read an,1538550.0,1541009.0
9,example or two L: okay I'll do my best,1541010.0,1542929.0
9,thoughts of dogs voice 'my human. is sad,1542930.0,1546379.0

9,G: so what's cool about this is all of,1555050.0,1557689.0
9,"these pauses are constituents, so 'my",1557690.0,1559399.0
9,"human', that's a constituent,",1559400.0,1559849.0
9,"'is sad again' is a constituent, where as",1559850.0,1562159.0
9,if instead it had been,1562160.0,1564139.0
9,'my human is. sad again' then that wouldn't,1564140.0,1566839.0
9,have been a constituent.,1566840.0,1567799.0
9,"So speaking of pauses, Lauren you do",1567800.0,1569989.0
9,prosody L: I don't do prosody but I,1569990.0,1572029.0
9,really like it. I mean I do prosody as in,1572030.0,1574519.0
9,I modulate the way that I speak using,1574520.0,1577579.0
9,"intonation G: I don't, I talk like a robot",1577580.0,1579709.0
9,L: yeah I have to put this in post hoc in,1579710.0,1582079.0
9,the editing phase. So intonation,1582080.0,1584469.0
9,"contours, we don't often think about",1584470.0,1588469.0
9,what they contribute but when it comes,1588470.0,1590479.0
9,to spoken language they are often the,1590480.0,1592939.0
9,thing that is doing the heavy lifting in,1592940.0,1595569.0
9,disambiguating sentences so things like,1595570.0,1598879.0
9,"'time flies like an arrow, and fruit flies",1598880.0,1601519.0
9,"like a banana', the intonation there helps",1601520.0,1604759.0
9,people. It's not as useful as some other,1604760.0,1608119.0
9,examples,1608120.0,1608808.0
9,G: whereas if you just say 'time.. flies.. like..,1608809.0,1611569.0
9,an.. arrow..' it's harder to tell what,1611570.0,1615829.0
9,you mean by it,1615830.0,1616398.0
9,L: yep and so prosody can often give us,1616399.0,1618888.0
9,some clues as to what's happening in,1618889.0,1621378.0
9,terms of how the constituents are,1621379.0,1622758.0
9,"grouped, and that helps disambiguate",1622759.0,1625128.0
9,things. So my favourite meme example is a,1625129.0,1630109.0
9,picture of some arctic ice and some glow,1630110.0,1635058.0
9,"sticks and small fluffy things, with the",1635059.0,1638418.0
9,line down the bottom 'stop clubbing baby,1638419.0,1641028.0
9,"seals', which when you say it that way",1641029.0,1643248.0
9,entirely deserves dancing G: baby seals,1643249.0,1646038.0
9,"what are you doing partying so late,",1646039.0,1648079.0
9,you've got to get up tomorrow!,1648080.0,1649368.0
9,"L: awwww you're only babies! G: you're only babies,",1649369.0,1653178.0
9,are you even allowed to drink yet?! L: which has an obviously,1653179.0,1655908.0
9,very different reading to 'stop clubbing,1655909.0,1658819.0
9,baby seals' G: yeah as in stop,1658820.0,1661219.0
9,hitting them with clubs L: and so it's,1661220.0,1662508.0
9,"prosody, and it's the absence of",1662509.0,1665148.0
9,prosody in the photo meme that is,1665149.0,1667099.0
9,creating the joke G: and these memes often,1667100.0,1669168.0
9,come around with oh this is the,1669169.0,1670819.0
9,"importance of commas, but commas are",1670820.0,1673459.0
9,just an imperfect representation of,1673460.0,1674898.0
9,prosody.,1674899.0,1675979.0
9,But I think a lot of these ambiguity,1675980.0,1677808.0
9,"examples work better in writing, precisely",1677809.0,1679459.0
9,"because we're so good at prosody, like",1679460.0,1681408.0
9,how you didn't get the people in Ipswich,1681409.0,1683329.0
9,example even though it was totally clear,1683330.0,1684949.0
9,to me listening to the audio of it L: you,1684950.0,1687138.0
9,would have to be deliberately trying,1687139.0,1688518.0
9,very hard to mishear 'I did a course on,1688519.0,1690469.0
9,understanding people...,1690470.0,1692449.0
9,in Ipswich'. So prosody is doing all the,1692450.0,1696678.0
9,heavy lifting there and it's completely,1696679.0,1697969.0
9,"underrated, so just giving a",1697970.0,1700788.0
9,shout-out to my mate prosody G: yeah well,1700789.0,1703518.0
9,"and this is another thing, it's not",1703519.0,1704989.0
9,necessarily terribly good as a,1704990.0,1706248.0
9,constituency test because commas are,1706249.0,1708768.0
9,weird and generally linguist don't like,1708769.0,1710479.0
9,"to use written stuff as a test, but if",1710480.0,1712428.0
9,you can think of 'where could you,1712429.0,1713719.0
9,put commas in this sentence and have the,1713720.0,1715969.0
9,meanings still be preserved?' those are,1715970.0,1718128.0
9,going to be constituency boundaries. It's,1718129.0,1719418.0
9,not necessary going to be all of them,1719419.0,1720469.0
9,"but it's going to be some of them,",1720470.0,1721939.0
9,because that's one of the things,1721940.0,1723918.0
9,that pauses indicators is where there,1723919.0,1726288.0
9,are some breaks between stuff L: we've been,1726289.0,1728028.0
9,talking about things like intonation and,1728029.0,1730989.0
9,what words are entirely with English,1730990.0,1734178.0
9,"example sentences, that is because that",1734179.0,1736878.0
9,is the language that is the medium of,1736879.0,1738859.0
9,"this podcast, but we really as always,",1738860.0,1741739.0
9,because we,1741740.0,1742549.0
9,like talking about all of the world's,1742550.0,1744529.0
9,"languages, we want to stress that these",1744530.0,1746209.0
9,"certain types of tests can be done, all",1746210.0,1748759.0
9,languages breakdown structures to some,1748760.0,1751819.0
9,degree in this way G: yeah all languages,1751820.0,1754309.0
9,"have constituents, they have stuff that",1754310.0,1756109.0
9,is more closely associated than other,1756110.0,1757969.0
9,"stuff, which tests you can use to show",1757970.0,1759529.0
9,that differs depending on the,1759530.0,1760939.0
9,language and what exactly they use to,1760940.0,1763729.0
9,create those relationships. So in some,1763730.0,1766639.0
9,cases you can do constituency with parts,1766640.0,1769729.0
9,of a single word not just with groups of,1769730.0,1772549.0
9,words as a whole so there's some,1772550.0,1773719.0
9,"examples of that in English, one example",1773720.0,1775429.0
9,that is very clear is 'undoable'.,1775430.0,1778819.0
9,"So 'undoable' can mean two things, one",1778820.0,1781429.0
9,"thing it can mean is it's 'un' 'doable',",1781430.0,1784729.0
9,"it's not able to be done, and then the",1784730.0,1788089.0
9,other thing it can mean is it's 'undo',1788090.0,1790219.0
9,'able' which is it's able to be undone,1790220.0,1793789.0
9,"L: as in, you can control z this G: you",1793790.0,1796219.0
9,"can control z this, there's an eraser",1796220.0,1798289.0
9,"here, whereas this is just impossible",1798290.0,1800599.0
9,it's 'un...doable'. And you can get more,1800600.0,1802819.0
9,elaborate types of constituency with,1802820.0,1807709.0
9,with things on a word,1807710.0,1809899.0
9,as well as between words. So one example,1809900.0,1811849.0
9,that I have for this comes from my,1811850.0,1813679.0
9,"misspent Latin education, which was not",1813680.0,1815779.0
9,"misspent at all I loved it, and this is",1815780.0,1819079.0
9,a thing that Latin poems would do,1819080.0,1821389.0
9,which is they would really mess around,1821390.0,1823429.0
9,with a word order. In English the,1823430.0,1825049.0
9,"word order is very important, Latin poems",1825050.0,1827029.0
9,especially would often just,1827030.0,1830269.0
9,you'd have the phrase,1830270.0,1832579.0
9,"'from a long river' or something,",1832580.0,1834649.0
9,you'd have 'the river' in one line of,1834650.0,1836719.0
9,the poem and ' the long' in another line of,1836720.0,1838489.0
9,the poem and you had to realise that,1838490.0,1839869.0
9,they were actually being associated with,1839870.0,1841789.0
9,"each other, and it wasn't just like",1841790.0,1843289.0
9,there's 'from a river' and there's 'from a,1843290.0,1844669.0
9,"long something', you had to realise that",1844670.0,1848659.0
9,"they were constituent together, they were",1848660.0,1850429.0
9,actually trying to talk to each other,1850430.0,1851749.0
9,and the poet I just moved them around to,1851750.0,1853699.0
9,get a better rhythm. And so,1853700.0,1855679.0
9,the way that you do this in Latin is the,1855680.0,1857389.0
9,"endings would have to match, so if you",1857390.0,1859849.0
9,have the word for river in Latin,1859850.0,1861439.0
9,"'fluvias', so if you have 'fluvias' that's",1861440.0,1863509.0
9,"the form of it when it's a subject,",1863510.0,1865459.0
9,and then you have 'longus' which,1865460.0,1868159.0
9,would be the form of the adjective when,1868160.0,1869839.0
9,it's a subject matching it's masculine,1869840.0,1872539.0
9,"'us' ending, so those would be the same",1872540.0,1874669.0
9,"thing, but if you have 'from a",1874670.0,1875759.0
9,long river' that's an ablative so now you,1875760.0,1877919.0
9,"have 'fluvio longo', and even 'longo' is",1877920.0,1880589.0
9,in line one and 'fulvio' is in line three,1880590.0,1882719.0
9,you can still be like 'oh they're both in,1882720.0,1884969.0
9,the masculine ablative singular maybe,1884970.0,1886949.0
9,"they're actually supposed to be together,",1886950.0,1888299.0
9,maybe they're actually constituent'. So,1888300.0,1889919.0
9,in English constituents tend to be,1889920.0,1891869.0
9,right next to each other but in other,1891870.0,1893189.0
9,languages you can really move,1893190.0,1894899.0
9,them around you have something else that,1894900.0,1896099.0
9,tells you 'oh these are things that,1896100.0,1898739.0
9,you're supposed to be interpreting,1898740.0,1899669.0
9,together' L: so it's not how you kind of,1899670.0,1901079.0
9,first encountered the idea of,1901080.0,1902579.0
9,constituency? G: yeah I was decoding poems,1902580.0,1905609.0
9,in high school thinking 'oh these two,1905610.0,1907019.0
9,things associate' and then when I got to,1907020.0,1908669.0
9,constituency later I was like 'oh this is the,1908670.0,1910559.0
9,same thing'. How did you first,1910560.0,1912329.0
9,encounter constituency? L: before,1912330.0,1914579.0
9,thinking about it in terms of,1914580.0,1915809.0
9,"linguistics, I think my first realisation",1915810.0,1918299.0
9,that different words and sets of words,1918300.0,1921479.0
9,could all feel the same kind of,1921480.0,1924029.0
9,grammatical spot and be one constituent,1924030.0,1927029.0
9,was essentially playing a version of,1927030.0,1929219.0
9,mad libs,1929220.0,1929819.0
9,G: oh yeah okay L: so if they wanted,1929820.0,1932669.0
9,something that was a noun you could,1932670.0,1934499.0
9,just write 'butt' or you could write 'my,1934500.0,1937349.0
9,brother's big fat smelly butt' and either,1937350.0,1939569.0
9,"way it would work, and be hilarious G: yeah",1939570.0,1942959.0
9,very hilarious when you're like seven L: so,1942960.0,1945629.0
9,"that is where, it was",1945630.0,1949979.0
9,trying to be funny in mad libs that taught,1949980.0,1953879.0
9,me to think about just how much you,1953880.0,1955769.0
9,could cram in while still actually,1955770.0,1958369.0
9,being the same type of constituent G: yeah,1958370.0,1962429.0
9,and I mean this gets us back to the,1962430.0,1964529.0
9,grammatical gender point which we,1964530.0,1966719.0
9,talked about in spisode two about,1966720.0,1968159.0
9,"pronouns,",1968160.0,1968699.0
9,why do languages even,1968700.0,1970649.0
9,"bother with having gender, well sometimes",1970650.0,1972299.0
9,it can help you figure out what's a,1972300.0,1974489.0
9,constituent because if you have,1974490.0,1977239.0
9,adjectives that have to agree with,1977240.0,1979439.0
9,"gender, particularly when you have a",1979440.0,1981539.0
9,language like Latin or Old English would,1981540.0,1983099.0
9,do this to where you could move around,1983100.0,1984689.0
9,"like this, it could help you find it, it",1984690.0,1986759.0
9,was like a little like one of,1986760.0,1988949.0
9,those like GPS microchips you put in,1988950.0,1990479.0
9,"your dog, it would be like",1990480.0,1993749.0
9,"'we've tagged you, you belong with",1993750.0,1995489.0
9,here' L: I think that there is also a larger,1995490.0,2000259.0
9,theoretical importance to why we should,2000260.0,2002599.0
9,care about constituents and that goes back,2002600.0,2004669.0
9,"to the thing we we're talking about earlier,",2004670.0,2007159.0
9,language isn't just made up of,2007160.0,2008569.0
9,"individual words,",2008570.0,2009619.0
9,you can't just take all the words from a,2009620.0,2011299.0
9,film and remix them G: yeah I think humans,2011300.0,2014389.0
9,don't just learn how to make sentences,2014390.0,2016459.0
9,by memorising all of the possible,2016460.0,2018079.0
9,sentences. Like ;time flies like an,2018080.0,2020509.0
9,"arrow,",2020510.0,2020779.0
9,"fruit flies like banana, someone came up",2020780.0,2022249.0

9,"first time you heard it, because you knew",2024710.0,2025969.0
9,what the words meant and you knew how to,2025970.0,2027289.0
9,interpret the constituent relationships,2027290.0,2029359.0
9,between those words. It's a thing that,2029360.0,2030649.0

9,"right now, a sentence that no one's ever",2032630.0,2034729.0
9,heard before because you know about the,2034730.0,2036949.0
9,relationships between them L: it fills in,2036950.0,2038719.0
9,as we said that kind of middle spot,2038720.0,2040249.0
9,between just individual words or sounds,2040250.0,2042589.0
9,"and this larger, full discourse",2042590.0,2045469.0

9,"at some point,",2048560.0,2050299.0
9,but yes figuring out what language is in,2050300.0,2052279.0
9,the human mind since we don't just say,2052280.0,2054199.0
9,individual words it's partly figuring,2054200.0,2056089.0
9,out what kinds of constituency,2056090.0,2057769.0
9,relationships do we have. and I,2057770.0,2059779.0
9,think there's a practical importance to,2059780.0,2061219.0
9,"it, so one of the exercises that intro",2061220.0,2063019.0
9,linguistics students typically get set,2063020.0,2064729.0
9,is you need to do a bunch of,2064730.0,2066168.0
9,constituency tests and then you need to draw,2066169.0,2068269.0
9,tree. But the trees themselves are are,2068270.0,2070398.0
9,are only a means to an end are not an,2070399.0,2071898.0
9,"end in themselves, they're just a",2071899.0,2073128.0
9,representation of all the constituency,2073129.0,2075589.0
9,information you can extract from this,2075590.0,2077029.0
9,sentence in a very convenient and visual,2077030.0,2080148.0
9,form. Then when you start,2080149.0,2082999.0
9,looking at them then you can say 'oh okay,2083000.0,2084979.0
9,well here's how these two sentences,2084980.0,2087049.0
9,actually have the same structure because,2087050.0,2089539.0
9,their trees look identical' L: and when you,2089540.0,2091339.0
9,draw syntactic trees it's one way to,2091340.0,2094039.0
9,very quickly see that sentences that,2094040.0,2096439.0
9,look the same on the surface have,2096440.0,2098419.0
9,different structures. So 'fruit flies,2098420.0,2101389.0
9,like a banana' the 'fruit' and the 'flies',2101390.0,2103789.0
9,"are together as a constituent, and",2103790.0,2106099.0
9,"they're in a separate node in the tree,",2106100.0,2107509.0
9,"whereas 'time flies like an arrow', 'time' is",2107510.0,2110629.0
9,"all alone, lonely time in it's lonely node,",2110630.0,2113479.0
9,and so you very quickly see that even,2113480.0,2115699.0
9,though they appear the same their,2115700.0,2117559.0
9,structures are different G: yeah so it's a,2117560.0,2119749.0
9,convenient way of visualising that,2119750.0,2120799.0
9,"information and conveying that, but a lot",2120800.0,2122959.0
9,of people got very buried in the 'oh I need to figure,2122960.0,2125329.0
9,out what are these constituents and,2125330.0,2126889.0
9,what's going on here' and it can be hard,2126890.0,2129559.0
9,to first ten or twenty or,2129560.0,2131689.0
9,thirty trees that you draw and every,2131690.0,2133519.0
9,single set of words you have to run,2133520.0,2134719.0
9,through this set of constituency test,2134720.0,2136039.0
9,but it's kind of like learning how to,2136040.0,2137539.0
9,navigate or learning how to make a map,2137540.0,2139249.0
9,"of the terrain, thinking about what kinds",2139250.0,2141589.0
9,of things have relationships and,2141590.0,2143269.0
9,getting good at just spotting them.,2143270.0,2145189.0
9,I don't have to run constituency tests,2145190.0,2146719.0
9,on every sentence I see now to see,2146720.0,2148249.0
9,whether something's the constituents,2148250.0,2149449.0
9,because most of the common types of ones,2149450.0,2151549.0
9,"I can just spot them, and",2151550.0,2154429.0
9,occasionally I get something confusing,2154430.0,2155899.0
9,like 'oh is that a constituent?' I have the,2155900.0,2157669.0
9,tests available but most of the time I,2157670.0,2159169.0
9,"don't need them, just because it's a",2159170.0,2160879.0
9,practice type thing you do when you're,2160880.0,2162319.0
9,beginning to flex your linguistic,2162320.0,2163669.0
9,muscles L: and I think sometimes people,2163670.0,2165529.0
9,just think that syntactic tree,2165530.0,2167479.0
9,drawing is some academic exercise that,2167480.0,2169999.0
9,we just make our students do so that,2170000.0,2172369.0
9,"they suffer, or if",2172370.0,2175099.0
9,they are the subset of people who,2175100.0,2177169.0
9,"go on and study syntax, who",2177170.0,2178999.0
9,immediately fall in love with it and,2179000.0,2180649.0
9,draw a tree for everything G: or it's kind,2180650.0,2182809.0
9,of like a meaningless intellectual,2182810.0,2184009.0
9,exercise like 'oh I can do sudoku I,2184010.0,2185629.0
9,can draw a syntax tree it's great,2185630.0,2187069.0
9,it's fun but where do you go from there?',2187070.0,2188869.0
9,L: but they do have really important,2188870.0,2191179.0
9,"implications, especially in the field of",2191180.0,2194179.0
9,computer language and how computers,2194180.0,2196339.0
9,interact with language. So for example,2196340.0,2199429.0
9,"Google Translate, just like in your films",2199430.0,2202249.0
9,Google doesn't just go word by word and,2202250.0,2204859.0
9,translate each individual word when you,2204860.0,2206929.0
9,put a sentence into their translation,2206930.0,2209209.0
9,"portal, instead what happens is it starts",2209210.0,2211609.0
9,thinking in terms of constituents and in,2211610.0,2214939.0
9,terms of larger phrases and it tries to,2214940.0,2217699.0
9,"match those up within its corpus, and",2217700.0,2219919.0
9,similarly with their search engines you,2219920.0,2222409.0
9,may type in a whole sentence but it,2222410.0,2224059.0
9,knows how to extract the constituents,2224060.0,2226189.0
9,that are relevant for searching G: yeah,2226190.0,2228049.0
9,anything that's trying to do it like a,2228050.0,2229279.0
9,natural language interface is trying to,2229280.0,2231079.0
9,figure out okay how do you understand,2231080.0,2232669.0
9,the parts of a natural language thing. So,2232670.0,2234619.0
9,there's practical reasons why,2234620.0,2235639.0
9,constituency is important so once you,2235640.0,2238309.0
9,get used to constituency you can make lots,2238310.0,2239839.0

10,way of kind of getting an understanding,219810.0,220739.0
10,"of how they work. G: Yeah, and I think for me,",220740.0,223259.0
10,"because -- at least personally, the way I",223260.0,225329.0
10,"got into linguistics was in high school,",225330.0,227129.0
10,I came across pop linguistics books and,227130.0,229079.0
10,"stuff like this, and I was like, 'Wow, this",229080.0,230699.0
10,"is so cool, I want to do this when I",230700.0,232169.0
10,get to university.' But I knew that I,232170.0,233909.0
10,"couldn't do it in high school, there's no",233910.0,235349.0
10,high school linguistics course that I,235350.0,236639.0
10,could take then -- they're still very rare,236640.0,237929.0
10,"in high schools -- and so I said to myself,",237930.0,239519.0
10,"'Well, I know it's not quite the same as",239520.0,241529.0
10,"language learning, but I'm going to at",241530.0,243389.0
10,least enrol in all of the language classes,243390.0,245279.0
10,that I can because I'm sure it,245280.0,248219.0
10,"won't do any harm. And, you know,",248220.0,250589.0
10,I could be learning about cell biology,250590.0,252809.0
10,"or something, or I could learn more",252810.0,254309.0
10,languages and I think the language would,254310.0,256918.0
10,"be more useful,' and I think they were for",256919.0,258238.0
10,"me. I mean, cell biology's fine if you're",258239.0,259798.0
10,"into it, but like... L: So what languages do",259799.0,262589.0
10,"you have experience of learning? G: So, I",262590.0,264978.0
10,started learning French in grade four,264979.0,268859.0
10,"when I was in school, because that's",268860.0,271259.0
10,the latest age you can learn French in,271260.0,272999.0
10,for Canadian schools. It would have been,273000.0,274228.0
10,"nice to learn it earlier, but that wasn't",274229.0,275339.0
10,offered. And then I did a Scottish Gaelic,275340.0,279059.0
10,summer camp when I was like 10 or 12 or,279060.0,282839.0
10,something? I went to Cape Breton and I,282840.0,285299.0
10,spent a week learning Scottish Gaelic.,285300.0,287039.0
10,"Everyone else was there to learn, like,",287040.0,288569.0
10,fiddle and step dancing and stuff and I,288570.0,290189.0
10,"was like, 'I'm just going to take all the",290190.0,291418.0
10,language ones.' I don't remember a whole,291419.0,296099.0
10,"lot of that, except for the fact that",296100.0,298139.0
10,they put the verbs at the beginning of the,298140.0,299459.0
10,"sentences, which is really neat, and I",299460.0,300659.0
10,"have a couple songs memorised from that,",300660.0,302609.0
10,so that's fun. So I can occasionally,302610.0,304529.0
10,sometimes do something with a song. But I,304530.0,306418.0
10,didn't really know much about grammar,306419.0,308069.0
10,except what I'd learned from French at,308070.0,309389.0
10,"that point, so I didn't have a lot to",309390.0,311099.0
10,hold on to there. L: Yep.,311100.0,312209.0
10,G: I also mostly self-studied Latin in,312210.0,315659.0
10,"grade 10, because again, I was interested",315660.0,319049.0
10,"in linguistics, and at that point in my",319050.0,320999.0
10,"mind, linguistics and Classics overlapped",321000.0,322949.0
10,"a lot, and the",322950.0,324309.0
10,history of grammatical,324310.0,325899.0
10,descriptions of English is very bound up,325900.0,327819.0
10,"in Latin. So I was like, clearly, this is the",327820.0,329529.0
10,thing I need to do. So I got myself a,329530.0,331449.0
10,Latin textbook and worked through all the,331450.0,332979.0
10,exercises. L: Of course! This is a very,332980.0,336429.0
10,good insight into how Gretchen's brain,336430.0,339249.0
10,works there. G: And then in grade 11 I,339250.0,342089.0
10,convinced my guidance counselor against,342090.0,344709.0
10,his better judgment to let me take both,344710.0,346599.0
10,Intro Spanish and Intro German and,346600.0,348759.0
10,continue my French -- L: Right. G: -- because I was,348760.0,352089.0
10,"like, 'Look, I'm not picking between these.'",352090.0,353289.0
10,L: That's a lot of,353290.0,356139.0
10,language. G: That was a really,356140.0,358029.0
10,"interesting experience, because one day, I",358030.0,359949.0
10,"remember, in German class we did numbers",359950.0,362019.0
10,"and then I went to math, and then in",362020.0,364239.0
10,Spanish class an hour later we were,364240.0,366249.0
10,"doing numbers and I was like, 'I can't...",366250.0,367509.0
10,"handle this...' L: Right, yeah, challenging.",367510.0,373179.0
10,G: But it really taught my brain. I really,373180.0,375549.0
10,convinced my brain that there was more,375550.0,377229.0
10,than one other language than French. L: Yup.,377230.0,379629.0
10,G: 'Cause this is a problem a lot of people run,379630.0,381489.0
10,into you when you're learning another,381490.0,382359.0
10,"language is that you're like, 'Okay, I have",382360.0,385269.0
10,"my native language and then I have, like,",385270.0,387609.0
10,every other language' and they just blend,387610.0,390909.0
10,"into each other too much.' L: Ah, that is how my",390910.0,393219.0
10,"brain is organised, definitely. G: I have",393220.0,395739.0
10,"to say, if you really want to convince",395740.0,397599.0
10,your brain that there are multiple,397600.0,398469.0
10,"languages, learning them all in parallel",398470.0,400779.0
10,is one way to get that. It's not pretty at,400780.0,405489.0
10,"the time, but it has been very persistent!",405490.0,408539.0
10,"Yeah, so then in undergrad I was",408540.0,410979.0
10,trying to do about one new language a,410980.0,412419.0
10,year for about eight years or so. So in,412420.0,414369.0
10,undergrad I took Ancient Greek for a,414370.0,415569.0
10,"year and then I was like, 'I'm doing too",415570.0,418059.0
10,many European languages this is,418060.0,419109.0
10,"ridiculous,' and so then the next year I",419110.0,420879.0
10,took Arabic. I took that for two years,420880.0,422829.0
10,and then wrote my honours thesis about,422830.0,424809.0
10,Arabic. L: Yep. G: And then I did a field,424810.0,427929.0
10,"methods class on Kinyarwanda, which is a",427930.0,430059.0
10,Bantu language spoken in Rwanda. And that,430060.0,432429.0
10,"was really interesting, but I learned",432430.0,433479.0
10,more about that from kind of the,433480.0,434649.0
10,linguistic side than from the,434650.0,436689.0
10,conversational side. L: Yep. G: I only remember a,436690.0,438429.0
10,few words. And then I took Italian,438430.0,441099.0
10,"just for fun, because I needed to",441100.0,442599.0
10,fill an elective. L: You needed to fill in,442600.0,444639.0
10,"your romance paradigm. G: Yeah, I needed -- I was",444640.0,446859.0
10,"like, I feel really incomplete in the",446860.0,448209.0
10,romance languages! I still have never,448210.0,449559.0
10,learned Portuguese and I don't know,449560.0,451629.0
10,"if it would be a good use of time, but there's",451630.0,453069.0
10,"a part of me that wants to, just to fill",453070.0,454569.0
10,"it in. Yeah! And then I got to grad school,",454570.0,456759.0
10,and then in grad,456760.0,457869.0
10,school I did a field methods class in the,457870.0,460389.0
10,"first semester on Mi'kmaq, which is an",460390.0,463359.0
10,Algonquian language located in Eastern,463360.0,464619.0
10,"Canada, and then I kept on working with",464620.0,466239.0
10,that language and the language teaching,466240.0,468159.0
10,classes and stuff for the rest of my,468160.0,469989.0
10,"degree and for my thesis. So yeah,",469990.0,473079.0
10,that was kind of when I,473080.0,474339.0
10,stopped learning a new language every,474340.0,476229.0
10,year. L: Fair enough! G: But I had a,476230.0,478449.0
10,really good run of it! L: Yeah! G: And the,478450.0,481179.0
10,European languages got easier and easier,481180.0,482709.0
10,as I kept learning more of them. The,482710.0,485169.0
10,non-European languages were each their,485170.0,486639.0
10,"own unique challenge, as far as the",486640.0,489219.0
10,"grammar went. L: Right. G: Yeah, so I have a pretty",489220.0,491559.0
10,extensive language learning history and,491560.0,493239.0
10,I definitely don't,493240.0,494739.0
10,"remember all of these, so obviously the",494740.0,496749.0
10,"question of 'What do you know, what do",496750.0,498039.0
10,"you speak, what do you learn?' is always one",498040.0,499929.0
10,that comes up when you're talking about,499930.0,500859.0
10,speaking lots of languages. But I did,500860.0,502599.0
10,spend a lot of time in language classes.,502600.0,504129.0
10,"L: Yeah, fair enough.",504130.0,505119.0
10,G: What about you? You speak some,505120.0,506679.0
10,languages. L: I kind of lumped my language,506680.0,509859.0
10,learning into three different phases of,509860.0,511809.0
10,"my life. So, the first exposure I had to",511810.0,515259.0
10,language learning was in primary school.,515260.0,516999.0
10,"My primary school taught Italian, but",517000.0,520809.0
10,by 'taught Italian' I mean in this,520810.0,522999.0
10,"very Australian -- Australia is, like,",523000.0,526109.0
10,upsettingly proud of its monolingual,526110.0,529679.0
10,"educational focus, I think, so a lot of",529680.0,531999.0
10,schools do some amount of language,532000.0,534159.0
10,"learning, but there's no real",534160.0,535449.0
10,"understanding, or nothing imparts",535450.0,538269.0
10,to students why you might be,538270.0,540399.0
10,learning this or why it might be,540400.0,541749.0
10,interesting to care about another,541750.0,543339.0
10,"culture or a language, and so I learnt",543340.0,545919.0
10,lots of random Italian vocabulary and,545920.0,547839.0
10,some songs in primary school and at,547840.0,550629.0
10,the start of high school. And then when I,550630.0,552489.0
10,changed schools halfway through high,552490.0,555039.0
10,"school, no one felt at all compelled to",555040.0,557919.0
10,encourage me to keep going with Italian,557920.0,560529.0
10,or to take up one of the languages at,560530.0,562479.0
10,"that school, and I didn't really",562480.0,565059.0
10,understand the idea of learning,565060.0,567189.0
10,languages.,567190.0,568359.0
10,Everyone in my family day-to-day spoke,568360.0,570579.0
10,"English, everyone in my social life",570580.0,572199.0
10,"day-to-day spoke English, and other",572200.0,574539.0
10,countries and languages just seemed,574540.0,576189.0
10,really far away. So that was kind of my,576190.0,578079.0
10,"early, underwhelming language exposure.",578080.0,580209.0
10,Does mean I can navigate an Italian,580210.0,582039.0
10,"menu quite well sometimes, but not",582040.0,584799.0
10,"much more. G: Yeah, I mean, I guess for me",584800.0,586719.0
10,"in Canada, the French thing was, 'Well, you",586720.0,590619.0
10,should stay in French,590620.0,591579.0
10,because it'll help you get a job later.',591580.0,592749.0
10,"Because if you want to work in tourism,",592750.0,594189.0
10,"or if you want to work for the government,",594190.0,595359.0
10,it's useful to be able to speak French. So it was,595360.0,597159.0
10,"very kind of, like, mercenary-focused",597160.0,599439.0
10,around learning the language. L: And also being,599440.0,601809.0
10,"in Canada, like, even if you're in an",601810.0,603339.0
10,"English-speaking province, you're exposed",603340.0,606009.0
10,to this idea that French is a,606010.0,607899.0
10,"language in the wild, like it's on your",607900.0,610179.0
10,groceries when you buy them and it's in,610180.0,611949.0
10,the news -- G: Yeah. L: -- kind of thing. G: Yeah. L: So then,611950.0,614469.0
10,"after high school, I went to live in",614470.0,616299.0
10,Poland for a year and that was,616300.0,619209.0
10,"interesting, because my grandmother's",619210.0,621849.0
10,Polish and it's her first language and,621850.0,624279.0
10,so I was interested in kind of,624280.0,627039.0
10,reconnecting with that and also kind of,627040.0,629139.0
10,just living somewhere different and,629140.0,630489.0
10,doing something different. And that's my,630490.0,632559.0
10,"period of, like, understanding the",632560.0,634599.0
10,"motivation for language learning, but it",634600.0,636789.0
10,was before I'd done linguistics or really,636790.0,639219.0
10,had any good role models for language,639220.0,641409.0
10,learning and so I became pretty,641410.0,644559.0
10,"competent, but I missed out on a lot of",644560.0,646689.0
10,things that are kind of considered good,646690.0,649029.0
10,practice for becoming a strong second,649030.0,651339.0
10,language learner. So I was having some,651340.0,653079.0
10,"lessons, but I wasn't always good at kind",653080.0,655989.0
10,of encouraging myself to speak to people,655990.0,658869.0
10,"in certain contexts, and so I really",658870.0,662379.0
10,"enjoyed doing that, but when I got to",662380.0,664509.0
10,Australia there weren't many,664510.0,666219.0
10,opportunities to continue that. And for,666220.0,668919.0
10,some reason I think I was so annoyed,668920.0,670209.0
10,about that when I started university,670210.0,672219.0
10,that I never took up a language course.,672220.0,675479.0
10,"G: I took, like, all the languages, I was",675480.0,678069.0
10,"like, 'Oh, I can finally take other languages!'",678070.0,680289.0
10,L: I really don't understand what 19-year-old,680290.0,682689.0
10,"Lauren was thinking, but I'm really",682690.0,683979.0
10,"thankful that she took linguistics,",683980.0,686519.0
10,because obviously I've been pretty,686520.0,688839.0
10,enthusiastic about it ever since. And,688840.0,691299.0
10,that kind of led to my third,691300.0,694659.0
10,"era of language learning, which has",694660.0,697059.0
10,"been kind of understanding, like, post-",697060.0,699369.0
10,"studying linguistics, understanding my",699370.0,702159.0

10,"then I've learnt Nepali,",707470.0,709509.0
10,which I use in kind of day-to-day,709510.0,712029.0
10,"interactions when I'm on fieldwork, and",712030.0,714009.0
10,Nepali is great because it's an,714010.0,716889.0
10,"Indo-Aryan language, so it's part of this",716890.0,719439.0
10,"larger Indo-European family, so it's not",719440.0,722409.0
10,too hard for me to get my head around,722410.0,724948.0
10,"in terms of the structure, but it",724949.0,728398.0
10,"does some really cool, nifty things with",728399.0,730888.0
10,the grammar. And I've also learnt -- to,730889.0,733618.0
10,"varying degrees, not as well -- a couple of",733619.0,737128.0
10,different Tibetan dialects that I've,737129.0,739198.0
10,worked with. I would say my competency,739199.0,741659.0
10,there is more what we call passive,741660.0,743729.0
10,"competency in linguistics. So, I can",743730.0,746698.0
10,understand a lot of things that are said,746699.0,748378.0

10,And then I've also been learning some,753089.0,756088.0
10,Auslan at various points while in,756089.0,758039.0
10,"Australia, which is the Australian sign",758040.0,760798.0
10,language. It's related to British Sign,760799.0,763168.0
10,"and New Zealand Sign Language, and now",763169.0,766469.0
10,that I've moved back to Australia I'm,766470.0,767938.0
10,really looking forward to getting back,767939.0,769378.0
10,into Auslan. And that's been really great,769379.0,771988.0
10,because it's completely unrelated to my,771989.0,773909.0
10,"study, I just really enjoy it.",773910.0,776308.0
10,So that's kind of a whirlwind tour of,776309.0,778798.0
10,my -- G: And it's related to your,778799.0,780539.0
10,research in the sense that you do,780540.0,782039.0
10,"gesture, and so having a better",782040.0,784168.0
10,understanding of sign probably helps you,784169.0,785878.0
10,"with gesture research? I don't know, I'm",785879.0,787108.0
10,making this up. L: It helps with my gesture,787109.0,788698.0
10,"research, but, you know, I think as a",788699.0,790469.0
10,linguist I can kind of make the excuse,790470.0,792388.0
10,that any language learning is helpful,792389.0,794578.0
10,"for my job to some degree, but I also",794579.0,796738.0
10,just love Auslan and learning a sign,796739.0,798988.0
10,language is a really fun change from,798989.0,800878.0
10,spoken language to a sign language is,800879.0,803308.0
10,"quite good for my brain, and it does get",803309.0,806188.0
10,less chatted up with all the random bits,806189.0,809039.0
10,"of Italian and, you know, café French. G: I",809040.0,811588.0
10,never had the opportunity to learn sign,811589.0,814318.0
10,"language, although I'm sure I could",814319.0,815398.0
10,find lessons now. If I was going to learn,815399.0,817258.0
10,another language it might be either ASL,817259.0,819148.0
10,"or LSQ, which is Langue des Signes Québécoise,",819149.0,821548.0
10,and I'm not quite sure what the relative,821549.0,823318.0
10,"linguistic situation there is about,",823319.0,824789.0
10,"which one is spoken more in Montreal,",824790.0,826409.0
10,but yeah. I knew a linguist who could,826410.0,829798.0
10,speak Mayan and was learning ASL and was,829799.0,831418.0
10,"like, 'My brain is trying to do Mayan",831419.0,833668.0
10,structures in ASL and it's the,833669.0,836188.0
10,weirdest thing.',836189.0,836729.0
10,"L: Oh, that's great, that's so good. G: Yeah! So, I",836730.0,841108.0
10,don't know if that,841109.0,842638.0
10,"happens everybody, but I guess some",842639.0,843688.0
10,people do get that kind of cross-modal,843689.0,844858.0
10,"transfer. For me, the question of, okay,",844859.0,847168.0
10,"how many languages do you speak is,",847169.0,849659.0
10,"I can answer that, but I feel",849660.0,851188.0
10,like I'm kind of letting down the team,851189.0,852298.0
10,in that case because I don't speak,852299.0,854368.0
10,"a lot of them terribly well, and I",854369.0,857068.0
10,think for me one of the things,857069.0,858418.0
10,that,858419.0,858839.0
10,changed was when I started learning,858840.0,861139.0
10,"non-European languages, I mean the",861140.0,863669.0
10,"grammar was very different, but also the",863670.0,865709.0
10,kind of cultural context that you come,865710.0,868319.0
10,into learning those is a lot different.,868320.0,870419.0
10,"So, you know, as an English speaker,",870420.0,872159.0
10,"learning French, particularly in Canada",872160.0,874049.0
10,where they're both official,874050.0,876149.0
10,"languages and so on, that's very",876150.0,877709.0
10,different from being either an,877710.0,879509.0
10,English- or French-speaker in Canada,879510.0,881099.0
10,learning a Canadian indigenous language,881100.0,882629.0
10,"where, you know, indigenous languages aren't on",882630.0,884879.0
10,the cereal boxes. L: Yeah. G: Where they aren't,884880.0,886679.0
10,being taught in schools from a very,886680.0,889019.0
10,young age the way English and French are.,889020.0,891299.0
10,L: Yeah. G: So I think becoming more aware of,891300.0,893189.0
10,kind of the colonial context in which,893190.0,895019.0
10,language learning and denying people the,895020.0,897989.0
10,opportunity to learn their language is a,897990.0,899879.0
10,bigger issue that I became more aware of.,899880.0,901109.0
10,L: I grew up in Australia on Bunurong,901110.0,903659.0
10,country and that is a language that is,903660.0,906479.0
10,now taught in some primary schools,906480.0,908669.0
10,"around that area, which makes me",908670.0,910739.0
10,so happy and I wish that was a thing,910740.0,912539.0
10,that happened when I was a kid. There is,912540.0,914129.0
10,"a lot of complexity around, you know,",914130.0,916409.0
10,"language ownership, especially in the",916410.0,919079.0
10,Australian context -- who is allowed to,919080.0,920849.0
10,learn a language and which parts of a,920850.0,923039.0
10,"language -- it doesn't operate the same as, say,",923040.0,925259.0
10,English or French or Italian where you,925260.0,928109.0
10,can hand someone a textbook and they,928110.0,929459.0
10,kind of have the right to speak the whole,929460.0,931589.0
10,"language. So there's an imbalance there,",931590.0,933869.0
10,and there's also just -- same in,933870.0,935699.0
10,Australia as in Canada -- that historical,935700.0,937859.0
10,imbalance of who is expected to learn,937860.0,941069.0
10,"whose language. G: Yeah, exactly, and if",941070.0,943319.0
10,"you say, like, okay, well, my ancestors are",943320.0,944939.0
10,the ones that were preventing their,944940.0,946169.0
10,ancestors from learning the language in,946170.0,947939.0
10,the first place and now I want to come,947940.0,949229.0
10,"in and I've decided it's cool, like,",949230.0,950849.0
10,that's a weird position to be in. L: And,950850.0,952349.0
10,there's also a bit of a problem in,952350.0,954389.0
10,Australia with heritage languages. So as,954390.0,956159.0
10,"I mentioned, my grandmother is a native",956160.0,957569.0
10,Polish speaker and out of all of my,957570.0,959849.0
10,"aunts and uncles and my cousins,",959850.0,961379.0
10,"I'm the only one who speaks or,",961380.0,963329.0
10,"more likely, spoke that language",963330.0,966629.0
10,with her to any kind of degree of,966630.0,968519.0
10,"competency, because in Australia there's",968520.0,970529.0
10,"this erasure, often, of people's migrant",970530.0,973499.0
10,languages and their linguistic,973500.0,974879.0
10,experience. And she was told to never,974880.0,977039.0
10,"speak Polish, or, she's also a fluent",977040.0,979409.0
10,"German speaker, and was told to not speak",979410.0,981059.0
10,either of those to her own children,981060.0,982859.0
10,because it would interfere with their,982860.0,984899.0
10,English. And those attitudes are kind,984900.0,987299.0
10,"of changing... G: Yeah, I think it's",987300.0,988919.0
10,"the same here, though a lot of",988920.0,990329.0
10,"people, at least -- I'm not sure so",990330.0,992489.0
10,much about,992490.0,992699.0
10,people who came over in like the '60s -- you,992700.0,995549.0
10,get this kind of generation that,995550.0,997139.0
10,"immigrates, speaks their language,",997140.0,998939.0
10,"they learn English, and then their kids",998940.0,1000559.0
10,grow up and they're kind of more or less,1000560.0,1001819.0
10,"bilingual, and then the grandkids only",1001820.0,1003739.0
10,really speak the dominant language. L: Yeah.,1003740.0,1006199.0
10,"G: Depending on the community, some of them",1006200.0,1007639.0
10,try to retain their heritage language,1007640.0,1008869.0
10,more -- they'll send their kids to,1008870.0,1010519.0
10,Chinese school or Hebrew school or,1010520.0,1011929.0
10,something on the weekends to try to have,1011930.0,1013339.0
10,them retain that connection to their,1013340.0,1014719.0
10,"heritage language, and some of them don't",1014720.0,1016459.0
10,"have access to those schools, or don't",1016460.0,1018019.0
10,"feel the pressure to do that,",1018020.0,1019639.0
10,"so it depends on the community,",1019640.0,1021559.0
10,but there's a lot of language,1021560.0,1023089.0
10,loss. And I think that's something else,1023090.0,1024919.0
10,that doesn't come up so much in language,1024920.0,1026659.0
10,"classes, is there's this sense when you",1026660.0,1028669.0
10,go into a language class that you,1028670.0,1031069.0
10,walk in and then you're starting,1031070.0,1032899.0
10,with zero knowledge and you're going to,1032900.0,1034549.0
10,"have the knowledge, like, spooned into",1034550.0,1037129.0
10,you the way that when you walk into a,1037130.0,1039169.0
10,"math class, you don't know any math, or",1039170.0,1041299.0
10,when you walk into a science class you,1041300.0,1043879.0
10,don't know what a cell is and you just,1043880.0,1045799.0
10,have to get that told to you and then,1045800.0,1047239.0
10,you know. L: Yeah. G: Whereas for kids that are,1047240.0,1048919.0
10,"coming from a heritage language context,",1048920.0,1050389.0
10,"they may know some stuff, and there may",1050390.0,1054019.0
10,also be a lot more guilt about not,1054020.0,1055759.0
10,"knowing this stuff, or feeling like you",1055760.0,1057499.0
10,"should already know it, which you don't",1057500.0,1058939.0
10,"get so much, like, I didn't run into that",1058940.0,1060229.0
10,learning French or something. L: And there's,1060230.0,1061819.0
10,also a kind of prestige thing about,1061820.0,1064339.0
10,learning certain languages as certain,1064340.0,1067279.0
10,"communities, and so a lot of",1067280.0,1069529.0
10,English-dominant or English-monolingual,1069530.0,1072289.0
10,parents might see a lot of prestige in,1072290.0,1073999.0
10,sending their child to a bilingual,1074000.0,1076339.0
10,English-French school because French,1076340.0,1077989.0
10,"bilingualism has this prestige status,",1077990.0,1080269.0
10,but then we have these children who come,1080270.0,1082309.0
10,"in who are amazing bilinguals in, say,",1082310.0,1085879.0
10,"Vietnamese and English, or, in Australia we",1085880.0,1088129.0
10,have a lot of indigenous children who,1088130.0,1090259.0
10,"are Kriol speakers, so that's a language",1090260.0,1093259.0
10,that has a lot of English words that,1093260.0,1095959.0
10,"have created it, but it is its own",1095960.0,1097939.0
10,"language, or they speak a variety that's",1097940.0,1100399.0
10,called Aboriginal Australian English. So,1100400.0,1102979.0
10,they speak these varieties and then they,1102980.0,1104539.0
10,come into school and they're in a,1104540.0,1106519.0
10,similar position where they're bilingual,1106520.0,1108319.0
10,or they're trying to become English,1108320.0,1109729.0

10,fortune to just be able to do that. G: And I,1141560.0,1143749.0
10,think also that our expectations are,1143750.0,1145579.0

10,"school environment, that's gonna be a very",1166070.0,1167749.0
10,different situation because they're now,1167750.0,1169249.0
10,going to be expected to function at the,1169250.0,1171049.0
10,same level as these kids that have all,1171050.0,1173029.0
10,of this English at home as well. It's not,1173030.0,1174979.0
10,"just like, 'Oh, I can say a few greetings",1174980.0,1176569.0
10,and read menus and signs now and now I,1176570.0,1178729.0
10,"speak this language,' it's -- you're",1178730.0,1181159.0

10,also what the motivation for people to,1188570.0,1191809.0
10,learn a language is. So for a lot of,1191810.0,1193249.0
10,"people, to learn English is increasingly",1193250.0,1196159.0
10,considered a kind of economic necessity,1196160.0,1197689.0
10,"to move forward in life. Like, when I was",1197690.0,1200059.0
10,"in Nepal, for me, learning Nepali was a",1200060.0,1202309.0
10,"great way to connect with people, it's a",1202310.0,1204709.0

10,"know, if I didn't speak Nepali I would",1227540.0,1229789.0
10,probably still get by day to day in Nepal,1229790.0,1231229.0

10,many people there speak an amount of,1235040.0,1236719.0

10,I think also the difference in my,1767480.0,1770299.0
10,language learning now is that I have,1770300.0,1772339.0
10,moved through language and interactions,1772340.0,1775819.0

10,"early language learning experiences,",1792390.0,1793919.0
10,whereas now I pay a lot more attention,1793920.0,1795149.0
10,to things that happen in social,1795150.0,1797489.0
10,interactions. So how if interrupting,1797490.0,1800759.0

10,"to ask a question, isn't that how it works?'",1820380.0,1821849.0

10,rhythm of interactions allows for a lot,1824370.0,1826769.0
10,"more, like, 'I want to sit here for a bit",1826770.0,1828989.0
10,and then one of us can think of a,1828990.0,1831299.0
10,"thing to say, that's okay.' G: Yeah.",1831300.0,1834689.0
10,"L: Also politeness. So, like, who to be polite",1834690.0,1837779.0

10,in a Nepali context that I've just never,1860100.0,1862019.0
10,bothered to because that makes that,1862020.0,1864779.0

10,"say those things to -- and now, like, I know",1868290.0,1870059.0
10,with some of the younger kids I,1870060.0,1872159.0

10,"if I'm going to make these mistakes,",1896820.0,1897929.0
10,that's very interesting because,1897930.0,1899189.0
10,this is what it tells us about my,1899190.0,1900479.0
10,language capacity right now. Or I'm,1900480.0,1903509.0
10,"interested in what I'm doing,",1903510.0,1905159.0

10,intuitions about this and where do I not,1917340.0,1918749.0
10,have intuitions about this. L: There's a,1918750.0,1920369.0

10,acquisition in linguistics,1922230.0,1923699.0
10,that just looks at how people go about,1923700.0,1925499.0
10,learning their second language and I,1925500.0,1927028.0
10,remember taking that class as an,1927029.0,1928979.0
10,undergraduate and just being really,1928980.0,1930829.0
10,relieved to know things that we know are,1930830.0,1934678.0
10,pretty common facts about language,1934679.0,1936239.0
10,"acquisition, like there's often a very",1936240.0,1937709.0
10,rapid acceleration and then a plateau in,1937710.0,1940138.0
10,learning. So moving from being an,1940139.0,1943288.0
10,intermediate competent to an advanced,1943289.0,1945989.0
10,speaker involves a lot more work for,1945990.0,1948739.0
10,"visible improvement. G: Yeah, something that",1948740.0,1951418.0
10,was very interesting for me to learn in,1951419.0,1952798.0
10,second language acquisition classrooms,1952799.0,1954418.0
10,was that we have this sense,1954419.0,1956308.0
10,"that, oh, you need to start learning a",1956309.0,1958678.0
10,language as a baby because otherwise,1958679.0,1960058.0

10,"always going to, you know, it's always",1961559.0,1963209.0
10,going to be hard for you. But there are,1963210.0,1964469.0
10,actually some domains where adults have,1964470.0,1966178.0
10,"an advantage or older speakers,",1966179.0,1968069.0
10,"older children even, have an advantage.",1968070.0,1969388.0

10,"going to learn the sounds, the",1974340.0,1976469.0

10,all they're being exposed to and,1978240.0,1979979.0
10,they have that capability. But it takes a,1979980.0,1981898.0
10,long time for kids to learn a,1981899.0,1983849.0
10,significant amount of vocabulary or,1983850.0,1985619.0
10,"grammar. Like, if you think about a baby,",1985620.0,1987058.0
10,"right, a baby gets exposed to a",1987059.0,1988798.0

10,"awake, for a whole year, generally,",1991110.0,1994439.0
10,before it even says a single word. Like,1994440.0,1996808.0

10,"for a whole year,'",2003529.0,2004668.0
10,that's just not what our expectations,2004669.0,2006859.0
10,are when it comes to adults. And the fact that,2006860.0,2008538.0
10,an adult can walk out of an hour-long,2008539.0,2010038.0
10,class and have half a dozen words that,2010039.0,2012168.0

10,"forgotten half of them by next week,",2013940.0,2015558.0
10,that's still six words that they've,2015559.0,2018018.0
10,"learned, and the baby takes like a year",2018019.0,2020388.0
10,and a half to learn that. L: Six words up on,2020389.0,2023749.0
10,"the baby! And the other thing is that,",2023750.0,2025459.0
10,"like, I'm learning a language around",2025460.0,2027439.0
10,"having a full-time job and hobbies,",2027440.0,2029719.0

10,that you have a mouth and that,2047029.0,2050378.0
10,words exist and that language is,2050379.0,2053328.0

10,advantages -- you don't,2058160.0,2059809.0
10,necessarily want to be doing all of your,2059810.0,2061699.0
10,language learning by writing stuff down,2061700.0,2063049.0
10,because that's one of,2063050.0,2065509.0
10,the ways that people get very dependent,2065510.0,2066679.0
10,on a paper and not very confident about,2066680.0,2068029.0
10,talking -- but as an adult you do have the,2068030.0,2070009.0

10,"advantages. So adults learn, like,",2084530.0,2086299.0
10,vocabulary and syntax a lot quicker than,2086300.0,2089149.0
10,"babies do, even if you end up still",2089150.0,2091819.0

11,"that it's sometimes phrased in a way that deliberately breaks it, I think for",1769360.0,1774148.0
11,"for fun. So it's sometimes phrased as 'be perspicuous,' which is really",1774149.0,1781359.0
11,"not very useful, because you're like, 'What does perspicuous mean?' I had to look this up! But",1781360.0,1785979.0

11,"G: Or, like, if you're using words that are deliberately more elaborate than —",1791889.0,1795849.0
11,"or another version of it is 'be brief,' which can also be phrased as",1795850.0,1800528.0
11,'avoid unnecessary prolixity.' L: Yeah. G: Which basically kind of defines itself.,1800529.0,1805538.0
11,"But again, it's not so much like, 'this is what you should do all the time'",1805539.0,1808928.0
11,as 'this is what we generally assume people are doing.' So if you're,1808929.0,1812859.0

11,"about kind of working with people cooperatively in interaction, and there's",1846040.0,1851289.0
11,such a nice illustration of that. G: I think one of the examples that I've gone back,1851290.0,1856089.0
11,"to of Gricean Maxims working in tandem, from when I was an undergrad,",1856090.0,1860319.0
11,"was if somebody says, 'I'm outta gas.' You could say, 'Oh, there's a gas station",1860320.0,1864669.0
11,"two miles up the road.' L: Yeah. G: And that would be, generally, a very helpful,",1864670.0,1869289.0

13,thought that a way to get at that would be,726310.0,727689.0
13,to look at people who identified,727690.0,729819.0
13,themselves as having more than,729820.0,731619.0
13,one racial identity. So at first I,731620.0,733809.0

13,who have one black parent and one white,735820.0,737919.0

13,But I didn't really find that. It was,748650.0,751749.0

13,"bigger difference in the participants,",753520.0,755379.0
13,"that I interviewed anyway, was they were",755380.0,757359.0

13,how they personally conceptualised,759280.0,761289.0
13,"themselves as biracial or black. So, the ones",761290.0,763779.0
13,that saw themselves as more black did,763780.0,766059.0
13,patterns that we would be more likely to,766060.0,768459.0

13,traditional speakers of African-American,770260.0,772059.0

13,still way of 'doing' who you are.,789190.0,791199.0

13,do you put it together to make something,810370.0,811989.0

13,suspicious about everything that,1492260.0,1493639.0
13,happened to her. Anyway. I'm,1493640.0,1496129.0

13,the analysis that we did basically,1507860.0,1510439.0
13,says that the kind of contours that,1510440.0,1512449.0

13,hears her at a level ten when she's,1528860.0,1530298.0
13,"really at a level five, because if he",1530299.0,1532099.0

13,"would be at a level ten,",1533840.0,1535158.0

13,"that she was being misinterpreted, or her",1781820.0,1784639.0
13,"statements were being, it seemed like",1784640.0,1785959.0

13,"reporters, and the jury, and everything",1792890.0,1794839.0
13,"like this, because people just literally",1794840.0,1796249.0
13,did not speak the same language as her,1796250.0,1797629.0
13,and they attached all of these negative,1797630.0,1800058.0
13,"stereotypes about like low literacy, like",1800059.0,1802908.0
13,"poor, like blackness... G: But they're not",1802909.0,1804589.0

13,"No, she does not get the benefit of the",1806179.0,1807558.0
13,"doubt. G: Or, like, the ability to",1807559.0,1808908.0
13,clarify or re-explain herself and be,1808909.0,1810619.0
13,"like, 'I've been misinterpreted, here's",1810620.0,1811908.0

13,"traumatic, and all this. G: Yeah.",1816080.0,1817639.0
13,N: So what Rickford and King do is they go,1817640.0,1819139.0
13,"through, piece by piece, different points",1819140.0,1820788.0
13,of this testimony and highlight where it,1820789.0,1823099.0
13,seems like whoever responded to her was,1823100.0,1825619.0
13,not understanding what she was saying.,1825620.0,1826969.0
13,G: Wow.,1826970.0,1827538.0
13,"N: So there was one where the prosecutor, I",1827539.0,1830178.0
13,"think, asks her to pay attention, he",1830179.0,1832158.0
13,assumes she's not paying attention. And,1832159.0,1833599.0
13,"she says, 'I been payin' attention, sir.'",1833600.0,1835329.0
13,And what that means for speakers of,1835330.0,1839119.0
13,African-American language is 'I have,1839120.0,1840918.0
13,been paying attention this entire time,1840919.0,1842538.0
13,or for a long time.' G: Right. N: But he didn't,1842539.0,1844849.0
13,interpret it that way. G: So he interpreted,1844850.0,1846798.0
13,"it as something like, 'I haven't been",1846799.0,1847788.0
13,"paying attention.' N: Or, 'I've just",1847789.0,1849529.0

14,"what C-Gel does really well, is it captures the incredible variety.",630310.0,634409.0
14,So we're gonna talk you through some of the highlights of what,634410.0,637859.0
14,"the Cambridge Grammar of English Language talks about with prepositions,",637860.0,641159.0
14,but I think the important thing to take away from this is actually there are a,641160.0,644630.0
14,"couple of really basic, easy facts to understand about different categories of",644631.0,649008.0
14,"speech, because this is a category of the language, but actually grammar is",649009.0,653428.0
14,this incredibly fuzzy thing at the edges -- in the way sandwiches are semantically,653429.0,659138.0
14,"not always that easy, or birds are not always that easy to kind of categorise.",659139.0,662509.0
14,"Gretchen: Yeah, you think sandwiches are hard to",662510.0,664698.0
14,describe?,664699.0,665698.0
14,"I mean, this is the fun thing -- so I think the way a lot of",665699.0,669498.0
14,us encounter grammar the first time is in,669499.0,673578.0
14,language textbooks.,673579.0,674578.0
14,"Like, okay, here's a list of all the prepositions in Spanish,",674579.0,676838.0
14,you should memorise them.,676839.0,678758.0
14,"Or in English classes, where it's like,",678759.0,682008.0
14,underline the prepositions in the sentence.,682009.0,684378.0
14,And it seems like there's these very clear answers because they,684379.0,687420.0
14,selectively choose for you the sentences that have very clear answers.,687421.0,691989.0
14,And what's actually very interesting when it comes,691990.0,694558.0
14,to looking at this type of stuff is that the version of grammar that we get,694559.0,698398.0
14,presented with is this kind of 'memorise facts grammar' and the version of grammar,698399.0,702888.0
14,that something like C-Gel gives us is this kind of scientific diagnostic,702889.0,706789.0
14,"grammar that says, 'Well, if we've got this set of criteria for what a preposition",706790.0,711648.0
14,"should be and we apply this to this edge case, we end up with an answer for",711649.0,716638.0
14,"whether this particular word that's of dubious status is actually preposition,",716639.0,721078.0
14,"or is actually an adverb, or is actually a verb, or something else.'",721079.0,724969.0
14,And so if you like the kinds of arguments about,724970.0,727599.0
14,"what is a sandwich, this is actually this very similar type of argument, except",727600.0,731399.0
14,it's about what is a preposition.,731400.0,732689.0
14,Lauren: Yeah.,732690.0,733689.0
14,"Gretchen: And like how you end up with a scientific definition that says, okay,",733690.0,737679.0
14,"a robin is a canonical bird, and a bat doesn't go within the bird",737680.0,742799.0
14,"category, but a penguin does, even though a bat flies and a penguin doesn't,",742800.0,746169.0
14,because we've got this set of definitions.,746170.0,748378.0
14,You end up with this definition of a preposition that,748379.0,751268.0
14,sometimes leads us in places that traditional grammars that aren't as,751269.0,754828.0
14,experimentally based wouldn't have left us there with.,754829.0,758979.0
14,And so the traditional grammar definition of a,758980.0,761349.0
14,preposition is it's a word that goes before a noun or a pronoun.,761350.0,765229.0
14,Lauren: Mm-hmm.,765230.0,766229.0
14,"That's where the 'pre-' comes from, they're in pre-",766230.0,768488.0
14,position.,768489.0,769488.0
14,Gretchen: Yeah.,769489.0,770488.0
14,So this is wrong on both counts.,770489.0,771679.0
14,And this is what C-Gel points out.,771680.0,772758.0
14,"First of all, like, lots of stuff goes before nouns or",772759.0,775679.0
14,pronouns!,775680.0,776679.0
14,This is a wholly insufficient definition!,776680.0,777729.0
14,Lauren: Yeah.,777730.0,778729.0
14,"Gretchen: So if you have a noun like kangaroo, you can say 'the",778730.0,781849.0
14,kangaroo.',781850.0,782849.0
14,That doesn't make 'the' a preposition just because it can go,782850.0,784028.0
14,before kangaroo.,784029.0,785188.0
14,Lauren: You say 'the big kangaroo' and 'big' is not suddenly a preposition.,785189.0,788948.0
14,"Gretchen: Or you can be like, 'I see kangaroos,' and it",788949.0,791448.0
14,doesn't mean 'see' is a preposition.,791449.0,793198.0
14,"So this is just a completely, completely",793199.0,795838.0
14,insufficient definition.,795839.0,796838.0
14,"And the other problem is, is stuff that comes after",796839.0,800028.0
14,"prepositions isn't just nouns or pronouns, so it fails on both counts.",800029.0,803948.0
14,And this is something that traditional,803949.0,805219.0
14,grammars kind of recognise but just kind of don't really talk about that much.,805220.0,808258.0
14,"So, you can actually put a preposition in",808259.0,810628.0
14,front of a whole noun phrase.,810629.0,811768.0
14,"So you have, like, 'in the house,' not just like, 'in house.'",811769.0,815559.0
14,Fine.,815560.0,816559.0
14,"You can have adjectives -- so if you say something like, 'They took me for dead,'",816560.0,819869.0
14,"'dead' there is an adjective, but 'for' is still a preposition.",819870.0,822919.0
14,It can go before adverbs like 'until recently.',822920.0,825909.0
14,So 'recently' is an adverb and 'until' is still a,825910.0,828669.0
14,preposition.,828670.0,829669.0
14,And in fact it can even go before other prepositions.,829670.0,832568.0
14,"So if you have something like 'from behind the curtain,'",832569.0,834878.0
14,'behind the curtain' is already a prepositional phrase and then you have,834879.0,838148.0
14,'from' in front of the whole thing.,838149.0,840078.0
14,Lauren: Yeah.,840079.0,841078.0
14,Gretchen: And this is one of the places where C-Gel,841079.0,842708.0
14,"is like, 'Ah-ah, traditional grammar, you fail our diagnostics!' is you can put a",842709.0,847799.0
14,preposition in front of a full clause.,847800.0,850928.0
14,"So you can say something like, 'We can't",850929.0,852809.0
14,agree on whether we should go' and 'agree on' -- that 'on' is still a preposition by,852810.0,858688.0
14,"their definitions because they're like, 'Well, if it already failed our noun and",858689.0,862998.0
14,"pronoun test, why not have it go in front of",862999.0,865068.0
14,this thing as well.',865069.0,866439.0
14,And even though in a traditional grammar you call that a,866440.0,868448.0
14,"subordinate clause, they're like, 'Look, subordinating conjunctions: maybe not a",868449.0,871969.0
14,real thing?,871970.0,872969.0
14,Why not just call them prepositions?,872970.0,874138.0
14,"Because they sure look like prepositions, and this thing that we",874139.0,876638.0
14,"thought prepositions did, they already don't do, so why not these as well.'",876639.0,879749.0
14,And the same argument they have for solo,879750.0,882258.0
14,prepositions.,882259.0,883258.0
14,So if you say something like 'the resident of this house isn't in,883259.0,887188.0
14,the house.',887189.0,888188.0
14,Lauren: Yeah.,888189.0,889188.0
14,Gretchen: Then 'in' is very clearly a preposition.,889189.0,891558.0
14,"But you can also say 'the resident of this house isn't in,' and the",891559.0,894398.0
14,'in' seems to be like...,894399.0,895398.0
14,Lauren: So it's not before anything!,895399.0,896429.0
14,Gretchen: It's not before anything!,896430.0,898039.0
14,Whoa!,898040.0,899039.0
14,It seems to be doing basically the same thing,899040.0,900648.0
14,"as it was before, like, it should still work.",900649.0,903458.0
14,In the same way that you can say something like 'I'm eating an apple',903459.0,906789.0
14,"or 'I'm eating,' and 'eat' doesn't have to have 'apple' even though it could, you",906790.0,911300.0
14,could say something like that.,911301.0,912300.0
14,So they have this kind of expansive definition,912301.0,914588.0
14,"of a preposition, but the advantage that it has is that it's a more coherent",914589.0,918719.0
14,"definition of preposition, and it's one that you can use as kind of a lens to",918720.0,923258.0
14,test other words on.,923259.0,925349.0
14,So they say it kind of canonically or generically generally,925350.0,928578.0
14,"takes a noun phrase, but the other uses can be seen as an",928579.0,933669.0
14,expansion of that.,933670.0,934808.0
14,Lauren: And I think if you think of it as a thing that generally,934809.0,938659.0
14,marks spatial or temporal/time relationships,938660.0,943398.0
14,"that usually goes before an NP, you're actually fine.",943399.0,947768.0
14,In the way that most of us don't have to think about whether bats,947769.0,950828.0
14,"or penguins are more like birds or not,",950829.0,954409.0
14,"we can leave prepositions, the penguins of grammar, to the grammar",954410.0,959948.0
14,"professionals who write things like C-Gel, so you're not actually required",959949.0,964488.0
14,"to memorise that definition, that's just a way of looking at that kind of",964489.0,968808.0
14,complexity.,968809.0,969808.0
14,"Gretchen: Yeah, and like, the definition does have its appeal, and the",969809.0,973118.0
14,"kind of canonical examples do have their appeal, because you could say, well, here's",973119.0,975648.0
14,here's your canonical example.,975649.0,977328.0
14,And what it does let you do is it lets you give,977329.0,979128.0
14,this very exhaustive treatment where they've got like several pages each on,979129.0,982858.0
14,"the difference between prepositions and verbs, the difference between prepositions",982859.0,985388.0
14,"and nouns, and, like, how you can decide when you have all these edge",985389.0,989888.0
14,cases.,989889.0,990909.0
14,"So they have -- they talk about phrasal stuff, like -- so you have phrases",990910.0,995739.0
14,like 'by dint of.',995740.0,997298.0
14,"Like, 'I established what a preposition was only by dint of half",997299.0,1001868.0
14,an hour of talking.',1001869.0,1005638.0
14,"And so you might think, okay, well, the 'by' and the 'of,'",1005639.0,1008758.0
14,those are pretty clearly prepositions.,1008759.0,1010308.0
14,Lauren: Yeah.,1010309.0,1011308.0
14,"Gretchen: And so if you're like, well, maybe this is",1011309.0,1013648.0
14,"like another kind of -- like, what's the 'dint' doing?",1013649.0,1017159.0
14,"So if you think of it like a preposition, uhh... you can -- but",1017160.0,1021028.0
14,you can't do things like 'dint of hard work,1021029.0,1023479.0
14,"achieves wonders,' or 'she achieved this by hard work's dint.'",1023480.0,1029919.0
14,"So, like, normally you can replace 'of' with the possessives.",1029920.0,1033759.0
14,"You can say, like, 'the photo of me' or 'my photo.'",1033760.0,1038688.0
14,But you can't say 'she achieved this by hard work's dint.',1038689.0,1043119.0
14,"Lauren: No, you can't say that in normal English at all.",1043120.0,1046938.0
14,Gretchen: Or 'the hard work of which she achieved this,1046939.0,1049189.0
14,by dint.',1049190.0,1050829.0
14,"Lauren: I think, I mean, it is just worth saying really overtly here: a",1050830.0,1056749.0
14,preposition can be more than one word.,1056750.0,1058809.0
14,"So, 'by dint of' or 'as soon as.'",1058810.0,1061129.0
14,"Gretchen: Well, yeah, they have this whole criteria for like",1061130.0,1064449.0
14,"whether they should be multiple words or not, and I'm not even going",1064450.0,1067239.0
14,to get into that and how to analyse the multiple word thing.,1067240.0,1069369.0
14,"Lauren: But for the sake of the take-home message, we often think",1069370.0,1072538.0
14,"of prepositions as being those teeny-tiny ones like 'in,' 'on,' 'at,' but they can",1072539.0,1077089.0
14,also be multi-word as well.,1077090.0,1080299.0
14,"Gretchen: Well, and they had this interesting argument",1080300.0,1082148.0
14,for 'home' as a preposition a lot of the time.,1082149.0,1085199.0
14,"So obviously sometimes home is a noun because you could say, like, 'my",1085200.0,1088058.0
14,home.',1088059.0,1089058.0
14,Lauren: Yup.,1089059.0,1090058.0
14,"Gretchen: But sometimes if you say, 'I'm going home' or 'I'm home now,' that seems",1090059.0,1093379.0
14,to have kind of an inherent preposition,1093380.0,1094908.0

14,"Lauren: Yeah, you don't say 'I'm in home.'",1095909.0,1097339.0
14,"Gretchen: No, you don't say 'I'm in home,' and you",1097340.0,1099690.0
14,"could say -- the same way that you could say 'I'm going inside,' which clearly has",1099691.0,1102768.0
14,"an 'in' there, you say 'I'm going home.'",1102769.0,1105029.0
14,'I'm going downstairs.',1105030.0,1106268.0
14,Lauren: That's nice.,1106269.0,1107559.0
14,Gretchen: Yeah!,1107560.0,1108559.0
14,"And it's like, wait a second, that's so",1108560.0,1110249.0
14,weird!,1110250.0,1111249.0
14,But it works!,1111250.0,1112249.0
14,"Lauren: By the time you get to this point in the diagnostics,",1112250.0,1115379.0
14,it's not outside of the preposition space in particular.,1115380.0,1118729.0
14,"Gretchen: Yeah, yeah!",1118730.0,1119729.0
14,"And yet, I don't know, I find that one really hard to wrap",1119730.0,1121969.0
14,my head around.,1121970.0,1122969.0
14,But I love it.,1122970.0,1123969.0
14,So the other thing that's kind of cool about,1123970.0,1127558.0
14,the word 'preposition' is that it has a preposition in it.,1127559.0,1131979.0
14,So 'pre' is a preposition in Latin and can be used as,1131980.0,1135398.0
14,"a preposition in English, like you can say, kind of artificially, but you can say,",1135399.0,1139239.0
14,"like, 'I had lunch pre going to the meeting.'",1139240.0,1143139.0
14,Lauren: Yep.,1143140.0,1144259.0
14,Gretchen: And a preposition often indicates a position in time and space.,1144260.0,1149039.0
14,"So even though they aren't always words that come before a noun, which is where",1149040.0,1152229.0
14,"the word initially comes from, they do often indicate a position, and pre is one",1152230.0,1156548.0
14,kind.,1156549.0,1157548.0
14,"But you can also have, like, postpositions.",1157549.0,1158819.0
14,Lauren: So these are ones that come after the thing instead of before it.,1158820.0,1164099.0
14,"So, for example, 'a long time ago' -- 'ago' is",1164100.0,1167989.0
14,a postposition there.,1167990.0,1170189.0
14,"Gretchen: Yeah, and 'notwithstanding.'",1170190.0,1171668.0
14,So 'notwithstanding' is kind of interesting in English because,1171669.0,1174389.0
14,it could be either a preposition or a postposition.,1174390.0,1178048.0
14,"You can say 'notwithstanding the weather, the",1178049.0,1180219.0
14,picnic shall go on.',1180220.0,1181388.0
14,"Or you can say, 'Weather notwithstanding, there shall",1181389.0,1184489.0
14,be a picnic.',1184490.0,1185489.0
14,"Lauren: And just to be typologically completionist, you could have circumpositions,",1185490.0,1191288.0
14,where you have a bit of the meaning before and after.,1191289.0,1195519.0
14,So all of these are referred to as,1195520.0,1198749.0
14,"adpositions, technically.",1198750.0,1201269.0
14,"Although you will often find, even a language that has",1201270.0,1204019.0
14,"postpositions, in a grammar for English speakers they're called prepositions.",1204020.0,1207239.0
14,"Gretchen: Yeah, so 'preposition,' although you can",1207240.0,1208908.0
14,"decompose it into 'pre' and 'position,' a lot",1208909.0,1211469.0
14,of people don't think of it as separate pieces anymore.,1211470.0,1214009.0
14,"Lauren: In order to be, like, properly self-defining, these terms",1214010.0,1217949.0
14,should technically be pre-position position-post and... circ-position-um?,1217950.0,1223849.0
14,Gretchen: That's amazing.,1223850.0,1226379.0
14,I'm gonna make that happen.,1226380.0,1228808.0
14,Lauren: I don't think that's gonna take off.,1228809.0,1230408.0
14,Gretchen: I think we should make that happen.,1230409.0,1231959.0
14,I don't see how that would be confusing at all.,1231960.0,1235349.0
14,"Lauren: Just to make them properly,",1235350.0,1237569.0
14,clearly self-defining.,1237570.0,1238569.0
14,"Gretchen: Yeah, I mean, it's kind of like how you have prefix and",1238570.0,1241969.0
14,"suffix, which I guess should actually be fixsuf or something?",1241970.0,1244508.0
14,Lauren: Yeah.,1244509.0,1245508.0
14,Gretchen: We're working on this.,1245509.0,1246999.0
14,We're working on this.,1247000.0,1248428.0
14,Okay.,1248429.0,1249428.0
14,And this is one of those things that you can chop if you go to,1249429.0,1250538.0
14,other languages.,1250539.0,1251538.0
14,"So, Japanese is probably the most famous linguist example of a",1251539.0,1254599.0
14,language that has postpositions.,1254600.0,1256138.0
14,"So you would say something like 'Tokyo-ni',",1256139.0,1258599.0
14,"which is the same thing as 'to Tokyo,' but the 'ni' comes after Tokyo instead of",1258600.0,1262758.0
14,before.,1262759.0,1263758.0
14,"Neither of us actually speak a language with postpositions, which is",1263759.0,1266719.0
14,"very inconvenient, we should have picked our typology a little bit more carefully...",1266720.0,1269658.0
14,"Lauren: Um, Yolmo does.",1269659.0,1270658.0
14,"Gretchen: Oh, Yolmo does?",1270659.0,1271658.0
14,Lauren: Yeah.,1271659.0,1272658.0
14,Gretchen: Okay.,1272659.0,1273658.0
14,"Lauren: So you say 'Nepal-la,' which means 'in Nepal,' or it also means",1273659.0,1279548.0
14,"'to Nepal,' and we'll talk about semantics shortly.",1279549.0,1282859.0
14,"It's not entirely clear -- it is prepositional, it has all the",1282860.0,1286659.0

14,recognise that function at the end of the word like that if you speak a,1291370.0,1295089.0
14,language that has case.,1295090.0,1297918.0
14,And so case kind of tells you what role the noun has in,1297919.0,1302119.0
14,"the sentence, just to give the kind of nutshell definition there.",1302120.0,1306189.0
14,And in some languages postpositions are kind of the,1306190.0,1309538.0
14,case marker and it's not very clear that there's no separate function for them.,1309539.0,1314609.0
14,In other languages you have case and you,1314610.0,1316590.0
14,"have prepositions as well, I think Latin is a language that has both?",1316591.0,1321209.0
14,"Gretchen: So, Latin has both case and prepositions.",1321210.0,1325719.0
14,"So if you use the Latin preposition 'in,' which is",1325720.0,1328928.0
14,"obviously related to the English preposition 'in,' and the word 'casa,'",1328929.0,1331989.0
14,"meaning house, you could say 'in casa,' which would be the",1331990.0,1335839.0
14,"ablative case, meaning 'in or on the house.'",1335840.0,1339539.0
14,"But if you say 'in casam,' that will mean 'into or towards the house.'",1339540.0,1343539.0
14,Lauren: Okay.,1343540.0,1344539.0
14,Gretchen: Because the case differs along with that preposition.,1344540.0,1345989.0
14,Lauren: Yeah.,1345990.0,1346989.0
14,"Gretchen: So, like, you definitely can have both, but",1346990.0,1348839.0
14,"in other cases, a language will have a lot of cases for stuff that we might do",1348840.0,1352758.0
14,with prepositions.,1352759.0,1353758.0
14,Lauren: Yeah.,1353759.0,1354758.0
14,"Gretchen: So I think Finnish is famous as having, like, 14",1354759.0,1358008.0
14,"cases, which sounds really complicated, but some of them actually pretty",1358009.0,1361949.0
14,much just correspond to what you might do with a preposition.,1361950.0,1364439.0
14,"Lauren: Yeah, I remember when I learnt Polish I felt a",1364440.0,1366548.0
14,"bit, uh... it was the first language with case",1366549.0,1369139.0
14,"that I had learnt very well, and I think I felt a bit... cheated?",1369140.0,1374908.0
14,Because everyone had always talked about how,1374909.0,1376298.0
14,"case was this really stressful thing and I was like, well, a lot of it is just...",1376299.0,1380619.0
14,prepositional semantics.,1380620.0,1382178.0
14,"So, the space there is not always distinct.",1382179.0,1384778.0
14,"Gretchen: Yeah, so if you look at something like the",1384779.0,1388099.0
14,"comitative case, which just means the 'with' case, and it just corresponds to",1388100.0,1392258.0
14,most of what you would do with 'with.',1392259.0,1393829.0
14,"It's like, okay.",1393830.0,1395829.0
14,Lauren: With with.,1395830.0,1397839.0
14,"One thing I did find difficult was Polish, though, was the semantics of",1397840.0,1401888.0
14,different prepositions.,1401889.0,1403349.0
14,"So you'll often find, when you're learning a new language,",1403350.0,1406619.0
14,is that you will maybe get the definitions translated for you at the,1406620.0,1411308.0
14,"beginning of the textbook, or the beginning of the course, but what you",1411309.0,1414829.0
14,find is different semantics come into play.,1414830.0,1417658.0
14,And so there are two different forms of what roughly get translated as,1417659.0,1422249.0
14,"'in' or 'to' in Polish, which is 'do' and 'na.'",1422250.0,1426538.0
14,Gretchen: Mm-hmm.,1426539.0,1427538.0
14,Lauren: And you use a different one depending on,1427539.0,1429538.0
14,the place that you were going to.,1429539.0,1432439.0
14,So something like a shop tends to be used,1432440.0,1437579.0
14,"with 'do,' and a big, open place like a stadium tends to be used with 'na.'",1437580.0,1442499.0
14,So there's like a difference between things,1442500.0,1444619.0
14,"you are going to or in that are big and kind of open, and things that are small.",1444620.0,1450648.0
14,And it just took me so long to get my head,1450649.0,1452349.0
14,"around it, and I used to come with a different set of examples...",1452350.0,1457029.0
14,I was just... we could always tell I was gonna be,1457030.0,1459928.0
14,"a linguist, couldn't you.",1459929.0,1460928.0
14,"I would just be like, 'What about a cinema?' and my teacher",1460929.0,1463389.0
14,"would be like, 'Hmm...'",1463390.0,1464389.0
14,Gretchen: How big is it?,1464390.0,1465389.0
14,Lauren: 'I think that's 'do.'',1465390.0,1466389.0
14,"And then I'd be like, 'What about an open-air cinema?'",1466390.0,1468939.0
14,"Gretchen: Oh, no.",1468940.0,1470648.0
14,That is peak linguist right there.,1470649.0,1472969.0
14,Lauren: Yeah.,1472970.0,1473969.0
14,"Gretchen: Yeah, this reminds me of -- there's this thing in",1473970.0,1476079.0
14,"French, the preposition you use with the country varies depending on the",1476080.0,1480408.0
14,grammatical gender of the country.,1480409.0,1482058.0
14,Lauren: Right.,1482059.0,1483058.0
14,Gretchen: So France is feminine and that means you,1483059.0,1484989.0
14,"say 'en France' to mean 'in France,' but Canada is masculine and that means",1484990.0,1489959.0
14,you say 'au Canada.',1489960.0,1491409.0
14,And it's not because of the song.,1491410.0,1492469.0
14,Lauren: Okay.,1492470.0,1493469.0
14,Gretchen: Because it's spelled differently.,1493470.0,1494908.0
14,And so you have to know the gender of the country in order to,1494909.0,1497859.0
14,know the right preposition to use with it.,1497860.0,1500499.0
14,"Except if it's a country that begins with a vowel, and it's feminine, then you",1500500.0,1504028.0
14,say 'en' again.,1504029.0,1505028.0
14,Lauren: Right.,1505029.0,1506028.0
14,"Gretchen: Yeah, and then, like, islands do a different thing,",1506029.0,1508629.0
14,because like... and then cities do something else...,1508630.0,1510908.0
14,Lauren: Right.,1510909.0,1511908.0
14,So sometimes a preposition will encode information in one language,1511909.0,1515009.0
14,that they don't have in another.,1515010.0,1516389.0
14,"So in French, gender is necessary for",1516390.0,1519058.0
14,prepositions.,1519059.0,1520058.0
14,"Gretchen: Yeah, so French prepositions often",1520059.0,1521099.0
14,fuse with the definite article -- the same with Spanish -- and because they're both,1521100.0,1525518.0
14,"really small words and they kind of fuse together, and then that means that they",1525519.0,1528138.0
14,start to do things that the article does because the articles encode gender and,1528139.0,1532359.0
14,number in those languages.,1532360.0,1533749.0
14,"So, yeah, there's lots of interesting ways",1533750.0,1536169.0
14,you can kind of slice up the domains of relationships between objects.,1536170.0,1541239.0

14,Lauren: It's kind of all around.,1580120.0,1581999.0
14,And other languages will cut this up differently.,1582000.0,1585249.0

14,"Spanish that's in my example, maybe you speak a Spanish that isn't.",1588799.0,1592808.0

14,I just haven't had to.,1611169.0,1612168.0
14,Lauren: Yeah.,1612169.0,1613168.0

14,"Lauren: Yes, it does.",1620649.0,1622778.0
14,You have very good balancing skills.,1622779.0,1624798.0

15,them with kids because it's just easier to give a general impression.,769410.0,773299.0
15,But I think the classic way that I remember,773300.0,775088.0
15,counting time when I was a kid was with sleeps.,775089.0,778219.0

15,The other thing I've always found really hard to get my head around,840010.0,842219.0
15,with time is that different cultures obviously have different times that they,842220.0,846219.0
15,"celebrate the new year, that the concept of a new year and counting years is",846220.0,850349.0
15,completely arbitrary.,850350.0,852369.0

15,L: It's always so amazing!,861630.0,863459.0
15,It's like this thing that you think is this,863460.0,866049.0
15,"really important thing, and then you discover that other people, for other people",866050.0,869689.0
15,your new year means nothing and they've got their own thing going on.,869690.0,872689.0
15,"G: Yeah, and it's interesting how the year",872690.0,874919.0
15,"itself is so universal, but the time when you when you pick it is so arbitrary.",874920.0,879649.0
15,"Whereas something like a day, like we all have the same kinds of dawns and",879650.0,882948.0
15,"sunsets, because that's built in, but for a new year, sometimes people go for a",882949.0,886449.0
15,"solstice or an equinox, sometimes people go for a lunar calendar, where the",886450.0,889958.0
15,years don't actually quite match up because you're caring more about,889959.0,893159.0
15,"the months -- you know, there's lots of different types of years.",893160.0,896759.0
15,L: There's also a lot of cultural variation in how people conceptualise where they,896760.0,904119.0
15,are in time and how time happens.,904120.0,908588.0
15,And this is more or less a really elaborate,908589.0,911849.0
15,culture-wide metaphor that different cultures can have.,911850.0,916939.0
15,"So when you hear 'metaphor' you might think of, like, school",916940.0,921278.0
15,"comprehension classes where you've learnt that, like, 'the sun is a",921279.0,926279.0
15,big yellow balloon' is a metaphor and 'the sun is like a big yellow balloon' is a,926280.0,930919.0
15,simile and both of them are equating something with another property.,930920.0,934909.0
15,And that is true and you can use them as a very,934910.0,937458.0
15,"specific literary device, and in those cases the more novel, the better.",937459.0,943138.0
15,But we also have these metaphors that are,943139.0,945338.0
15,really pervasive in how we see the world and our place in them.,945339.0,950359.0
15,G: And they're so ingrained that you don't even think,950360.0,952319.0
15,"about them as metaphors, they're just how things are.",952320.0,954749.0
15,"L: No, so we really have to think about ourselves as souls in meat-covered",954750.0,958689.0
15,skeletons on a bowl of rocks hurtling through space.,958690.0,962078.0
15,And this kind of area of semantic -- it's really a kind of a property,962079.0,966778.0
15,of semantics and cognitive linguistics -- is,966779.0,969588.0
15,"probably best encapsulated, or kind of kicked off through a work by George",969589.0,973739.0
15,Lakoff and Mark Johnson.,973740.0,975268.0
15,So a lot of the work in this area is inspired by them,975269.0,979159.0
15,"and their book 'Metaphors We Live By,' because they're so pervasive.",979160.0,982919.0
15,"So, for example, we have a lot of things like",982920.0,984969.0
15,"'last year is behind us,' 'we can move forward,' 'I can't wait until Christmas,'",984970.0,991679.0
15,"like, 'Christmas is coming up really quickly' are all -- G: So, time can",991680.0,996729.0
15,move quickly in a way that's kind of weird.,996730.0,998549.0
15,"I think even just saying like, 'Oh, I'm looking forward to when we're gonna do",998550.0,1001198.0
15,"this,' that's like, the future is ahead of us, the past is behind us.",1001199.0,1004989.0
15,"Or, like, 'let's just put that behind us,'",1004990.0,1006569.0
15,meaning let's just forget about it.,1006570.0,1007909.0
15,L: Yeah.,1007910.0,1008909.0
15,So we have an orientation where the future is ahead and the past is behind,1008910.0,1012669.0
15,us.,1012670.0,1013669.0
15,And so we have two slightly different ways of thinking about this in English.,1013670.0,1016499.0
15,"We can say, like, 'I just have to get to September and then I can go on holiday'",1016500.0,1021449.0
15,and so we're moving through space towards September or the future or,1021450.0,1025819.0
15,"whatever is happening, and then -- G: Hmm, okay.",1025820.0,1028249.0
15,L: But we have a slightly different one where,1028250.0,1029809.0
15,"like, 'Christmas has come up so quickly!' where we're kind of stationary and",1029810.0,1034379.0
15,time is flowing past us.,1034380.0,1036409.0
15,But what's common to both of those is the future is --,1036410.0,1038819.0
15,"G: Like, 'I can't believe we've arrived at December already.'",1038820.0,1040949.0
15,L: Yep.,1040950.0,1042659.0
15,"But future, pretty safely anchored in front of us.",1042660.0,1047168.0
15,"Whereas there are other cultures, and the most famous one is Aymara,",1047169.0,1051319.0
15,"which is an Aymaran language of South America -- so with Aymara, the future is",1051320.0,1057939.0
15,behind us and the past is in front of us.,1057940.0,1061579.0
15,"And if you think about it, it makes a kind of sense, because we know what",1061580.0,1066449.0
15,happened in the past.,1066450.0,1067449.0
15,"You know, I know what happened to me yesterday.",1067450.0,1069589.0
15,I am not psychic and I don't know what's gonna,1069590.0,1072689.0
15,happen to me tomorrow.,1072690.0,1074779.0
15,So it makes sense that the future is in the part of your,1074780.0,1078289.0
15,"vision where you can't see and you don't know what's there, but you can look out",1078290.0,1081759.0
15,over your life and where you've come from as you've travelled through.,1081760.0,1086539.0
15,"So it actually, like, it's a really robust logic",1086540.0,1089259.0
15,"and it's totally the opposite metaphor, but it's encoded in their language the",1089260.0,1094279.0
15,way our way of talking about time is encoded.,1094280.0,1097529.0
15,"Another common one that's often talked about is,",1097530.0,1100599.0
15,especially in various Chinese languages where you have a vertical orientation of,1100600.0,1106009.0
15,"time, where the past is above and the future is below.",1106010.0,1109369.0
15,"And that's partly the the writing system that motivates that,",1109370.0,1112749.0
15,"and we have, even though it's not in our speech, we often see in our gesture, not",1112750.0,1117309.0
15,"only do we have this forward-backward space orientation, but we have a",1117310.0,1120989.0
15,left-to-right orientation.,1120990.0,1122659.0
15,So if you think about plotting out everything you,1122660.0,1125808.0
15,"have to do in the next couple of days on a timeline, then you're more likely to",1125809.0,1129918.0
15,put events earlier on the left and events later on the right.,1129919.0,1133099.0
15,"G: Right, so, okay, I'm gonna do this and then I'm gonna",1133100.0,1135439.0
15,do this and then I'm gonna do that.,1135440.0,1136969.0
15,L: Sometimes we have these metaphors that are so deep in our consciousness they,1136970.0,1140928.0
15,don't even show up in our speech but they show up in the way that we orient,1140929.0,1144659.0
15,ourselves.,1144660.0,1145659.0
15,G: But if we were using a right-to-left writing system like Arabic,1145660.0,1149099.0
15,"or Hebrew, we would probably plot out things on a timeline in the other",1149100.0,1152489.0
15,direction?,1152490.0,1153489.0
15,"L: Yeah, there's been so little research that's really nailed a",1153490.0,1156339.0
15,lot of this down.,1156340.0,1157548.0
15,Lera Boroditsky is a cognitive psychologist who's done some,1157549.0,1161499.0
15,"work on Chinese and English monolinguals and bilinguals, and she's found that,",1161500.0,1167558.0
15,"especially with Mandarin speakers, you can get them thinking",1167559.0,1171529.0
15,vertically or horizontally depending on how you prime them before you do the,1171530.0,1177349.0
15,"experiment, which is cool.",1177350.0,1178349.0
15,G: Interesting.,1178350.0,1179349.0
15,"L: So there's both long-term, like it's very hard",1179350.0,1180929.0
15,"for us to think about time forward and backward, but you can also",1180930.0,1184779.0
15,prime people to think about these metaphors in more short-term ways as,1184780.0,1188659.0
15,well.,1188660.0,1189659.0
15,"G: And people often use, you know, even just an arrow going from",1189660.0,1192999.0
15,left to right to indicate things about the future.,1193000.0,1195449.0
15,"L: Yeah, so Hillary Clinton's 2016 election campaign logo, which was",1195450.0,1201569.0
15,"very unpopular at the time, and I wrote about it and what the arrow was",1201570.0,1205900.0
15,doing in the H as it pointed to the right.,1205901.0,1209548.0
15,And also FedEx has that little optical illusion arrow in the logo.,1209549.0,1214599.0
15,"G: Oh, yeah!",1214600.0,1215599.0
15,"L: And if you look at it, they would never have",1215600.0,1217229.0
15,"done that logo if the writing was such that it went from right to left,",1217230.0,1223539.0
15,because that wouldn't be indicating kind of future-y dynamic forwardness.,1223540.0,1227089.0
15,G: Yeah.,1227090.0,1228109.0
15,Oh that's kind of like -- so email programs,1228110.0,1230189.0
15,"do this, right, if you have, like, the reply",1230190.0,1231899.0
15,"arrow has this kind of circle back pointing to the left, and the forward",1231900.0,1235739.0
15,arrow has it going towards the right.,1235740.0,1238959.0
15,"And those are just arrows, like, your",1238960.0,1240729.0
15,"email contacts don't exist in time and space, but they're",1240730.0,1245219.0
15,using those arrows to kind of transmit those ideas.,1245220.0,1247599.0
15,L: Yep.,1247600.0,1248639.0
15,So these metaphors are really pervasive in how we talk and think about time.,1248640.0,1252509.0
15,G: So FedEx doesn't want to make you think that they're gonna run off with,1252510.0,1255449.0
15,your package and take it back to the factory.,1255450.0,1258558.0
15,"L: FedEx your package, just comes back to you every time.",1258559.0,1262678.0
15,G: And that's what would happen if they used the arrow in the,1262679.0,1264741.0
15,other direction.,1264742.0,1265741.0
15,"L: Yeah, that would be... that would be a not-good...",1265742.0,1268119.0
15,"And, you know, it's -- I've written some stuff about emoji direction.",1268120.0,1272449.0
15,"So, they're oriented so they make sense in terms of Japanese word order.",1272450.0,1276809.0
15,G: Mm!,1276810.0,1277809.0
15,L: But in terms of English word order it makes,1277810.0,1280089.0
15,it look like people aren't moving forward from left to right and so,1280090.0,1284288.0
15,they're not moving forward in time.,1284289.0,1286239.0
15,And English speakers get really irritated by,1286240.0,1288189.0
15,that.,1288190.0,1289189.0
15,So the vehicles and the people walking all point from right to left.,1289190.0,1294629.0
15,And we interpret that as like they're going,1294630.0,1296479.0
15,backwards.,1296480.0,1297479.0
15,"G: Oh, okay.",1297480.0,1299369.0
15,"Whereas if you spoke Japanese, because that language is subject-object-verb and",1299370.0,1303399.0
15,then you want to put the verb at the end of the sentence so that you,1303400.0,1305548.0
15,"can be like, yeah, this refers back to the thing that was at the beginning.",1305549.0,1307808.0
15,"L: Yeah, so in that language it's pointing the right",1307809.0,1310739.0
15,"way, but for English speakers it doesn't gel with our sense of things",1310740.0,1314808.0
15,moving forward.,1314809.0,1316309.0
15,"And so I love this way because you really, you know, time is so",1316310.0,1319729.0
15,hard to get our hands on that we have to use whatever strategy we can and these,1319730.0,1324019.0

15,the world!,1332679.0,1333678.0
15,G: Yeah!,1333679.0,1334678.0
15,"Another thing that I take for granted a lot is that, you know, time",1334679.0,1337419.0
15,"is this abstract concept, but for some of us, and I'm one of them, we",1337420.0,1343859.0
15,actually have this kind of intuitive way of visualising time.,1343860.0,1347959.0
15,"So there's a phenomenon known as synaesthesia, which is",1347960.0,1350949.0
15,when you have kind of cross-sensory perception.,1350950.0,1353168.0
15,So the classic example of synaesthesia is grapheme colour,1353169.0,1356808.0
15,"synaesthesia, which means that certain letters or numbers have particular",1356809.0,1361409.0

15,"I want to talk about time-space synaesthesia a little bit, because this is",1368100.0,1371369.0
15,actually one of these kind of -- it's less talked about and it's a lot more common,1371370.0,1376548.0

16,G: /s/. L: And you can feel a difference. That's,602610.0,607350.0

16,with the /z/ sound. L: Compared to something like 'catsss'. So they're the two forms that,659630.0,664398.0
16,"we think of the most, but the plural actually has a third costume that it",664399.0,668169.0

16,"added to make a plural, it actually interacts with that sound system that we",704930.0,709559.0
16,talked about in an earlier episode on child language to create these different,709560.0,714528.0
16,forms. G: And we can see this if we do another variation on the Wug Test. So,714529.0,719119.0
16,"let's say I have I now have this purple, kind of doughy",719120.0,722659.0

16,Just not a thing.,742120.0,743119.0
16,"L: Yeah. G: And Jean Berko Gleason is often cited as being, okay, well, she's the wug",743120.0,747489.0
16,person. But she did this whole range of tests with people. And she had words like,747490.0,751989.0
16,"wug that end in a /g/ where you expect the kids to say /z/ for the plural,",751990.0,757729.0
16,and words like blick that end in a /k/ where you expect the kids to say /s/ for the,757730.0,762499.0
16,plural. And she also had words like kazh that end in a sound that's too,762500.0,767369.0
16,"close to a /s/ or a /z/ sound to just stick one on as a plural directly, and so",767370.0,774429.0
16,you need that extra vowel. Kazhes. Fishes. Foxes. L: So this isn't just learning words,774430.0,781008.0
16,"and their automatic plural, because kids have never seen these words when they do",781009.0,784338.0
16,"this test. G: Yeah, it's sensitivity to three different things about English",784339.0,788518.0
16,"plurals. And it turns out kids are pretty good at the wug/blick thing, and it takes",788519.0,793309.0
16,"them another, like, six months to a year or so to get the kazh thing. L: Right. G:",793310.0,798169.0
16,"So when they're really young, they'll say",798170.0,800969.0
16,'wugs' right and then they'll just say 'kazh' as if it's also the plural form. And then,800970.0,805458.0
16,"a year later you bring them in again, or you bring in slightly older",805459.0,807969.0
16,"kids, and they've got it. They've figured out this extra one. But it does",807970.0,810970.0

16,"or something like this? And so, spoiler alert, it didn't work. L: Huh,",871959.0,876849.0

16,"we had to give them more exposures, 'cause maybe you have to be",883570.0,886828.0
16,"exposed to an irregular plural, like, four or five times, or twenty times. L: So, it's",886829.0,891659.0
16,one of those things I think it's worth pointing out that sometimes a,891660.0,894588.0
16,failure just gives you an idea of how you might have gone wrong and that,894589.0,897929.0
16,"provides some insight as well. G: Yeah, so there's twenty different ways that we",897930.0,901699.0
16,"might have gone wrong, and I don't know what they are, and maybe it's just",901700.0,906148.0
16,"not possible! Like, we know kids learn irregulars",906149.0,908198.0

17,some sounds become other sounds in particular accents. So there are some varieties of English,551970.0,557719.0
17,that have that,557720.0,558939.0
17,have what's known as the pin/pen merger. L: Yeah. G: So in these varieties you have people,558940.0,563439.0
17,"say, like, 'a sewing pin' and 'a writing pin' because those are the same sound to them.",563440.0,567899.0
17,L: Yep. G: And the reason that that's,567900.0,569999.0
17,"possible is because /ɪ/ and /ɛ/, the sounds in 'pin' and 'pen,' they're neighbours in",570000.0,576509.0
17,"the vowel space. L: Yeah. Well,",576510.0,578659.0
17,"they're neighbours for us, but they live in the same share house for people with that",578660.0,582709.0
17,"merger. G: Yeah, exactly! And so because they're neighbours they can also become roommates!",582710.0,587569.0
17,"They can become -- they can glom on to each other and people can say, 'Okay, this is actually",587570.0,593769.0
17,just one space for me.',593770.0,594939.0
17,"L: Yeah. G: And it's all this sound that's kind of halfway between the two. L: Or, for",594940.0,598939.0
17,"example, other people might move them further apart. G: Yeah. L: So, I have generally pretty",598940.0,605819.0
17,"high vowels? So my /ai/, /i/ vowels are generally higher than yours are. G: Huh. Okay, say an",605820.0,614869.0
17,example of that. So I,614870.0,616049.0
17,"have 'me,' and you have...? L: So I say 'me.' G: Me. Me. Yeah, I think that is higher in",616050.0,621329.0
17,my mouth than -- me?,621330.0,622739.0
17,Me. Hm. Okay. /i/ You can have lots of fun with your friends and trying to say lots of,622740.0,629240.0
17,vowels like this. And so the reason why the pin/pen merger is possible -- so you don't,629241.0,633869.0
17,"get, for example, the pin/pan merger. L: Yeah. G: That's not going to happen anywhere, because",633870.0,639190.0
17,'-an' is pronounced way at the,639191.0,641989.0
17,"back of the mouth, it's a lot like your dentist 'aaaah'. 'Paaan.' And 'pin' is all the way",641990.0,649059.0
17,at the front of the mouth and higher against the roof the mouth. So if you have a low back,649060.0,654069.0
17,"vowel and high front vowel, a lot",654070.0,656119.0
17,has to happen in order for them to glom on to each other. L: Yep. G: But if you have,656120.0,660990.0
17,"two vowels and one is high front and the other one is kind of mid front, then they're pretty",660991.0,666429.0
17,"close to each other and so it's easy for them to take on the same space. Like, 'pin' and",666430.0,670119.0
17,'pen' do that. L: It's,670120.0,671129.0
17,actually impressive that we can all speak with slightly different -- our vowels existing,671130.0,676029.0
17,in slightly different points on the vowel space and we can all accommodate that. It's,676030.0,680290.0

17,of interesting that we only,697590.0,699189.0

17,"exactly the same, and there were all these other factors involved, but the important",1643700.0,1647308.0
17,thing is vowels started,1647309.0,1650109.0
17,"shifting. And they did this on a massive scale, and it changed what we think of as the way",1650110.0,1654808.0
17,English is spoken. And it certainly didn't help with how it was written! G: And it had,1654809.0,1659609.0
17,"this weird repercussion. So, a lot of people learned in school that English has the",1659610.0,1664389.0
17,long vowels and the short vowels. And the mnemonic that I learned was the long vowels,1664390.0,1668139.0
17,"are the ones that say their own name -- so 'e,",1668140.0,1670709.0
17,"a, u, o', those are the ones that say their own name -- and the short vowels like /ɪ/",1670710.0,1676519.0
17,and /ɛ/ and /a/ don't say their own name. L:,1676520.0,1679779.0
17,Yes. G: But that's a weird mnemonic! Why are we calling them long and short for that reason?,1679780.0,1685099.0
17,And it's because -- L: Especially when we've just learnt the word diphthong! G: I know!,1685100.0,1691149.0
17,"It's because in the history of English, and in many modern languages still currently,",1691150.0,1696089.0
17,there are,1696090.0,1697089.0
17,"long and short vowels, and the long vowels are literally pronounced for a longer period",1697090.0,1701029.0
17,of time. That's the difference. L:,1701030.0,1702678.0
17,"Yep. That is the difference. G: So if you have something like /bet/ and /be:t/, one",1702679.0,1709979.0
17,of those is just longer. Or hypothetically,1709980.0,1712649.0
17,you have /kne/ and /kne:/. L: Which is really hard as an English-speaker to get the hang,1712650.0,1717399.0
17,of because you're used to,1717400.0,1718509.0
17,"hearing these clear differences in the place, or that they're diphthongs or something like",1718510.0,1723569.0
17,that. G: Or /go:s/ and,1723570.0,1724980.0
17,/go::s/. L: You've made a ridiculous word even more ridiculous. G: I'm doing great at,1724981.0,1731549.0
17,this. And so what happened was this change affected only the English long,1731550.0,1737479.0
17,vowels. They shifted. They were all in competition with each other. And the English short vowels,1737480.0,1740709.0
17,stayed pretty much where they were and did pretty much a similar thing. So we used to,1740710.0,1745069.0
17,"have these nice pairs of /i/ and /i:/, /e/ and",1745070.0,1748869.0
17,"/e:/, /a/ and /a:/. And it was very symmetric. And, you know, it has a little bit of a different",1748870.0,1756609.0
17,"sound quality to it, but it was pretty much just the length that made the distinction.",1756610.0,1760569.0
17,And this is what Latin had,1760570.0,1762089.0
17,"had, for example. Latin had /a/ and /a:/, /i/ and",1762090.0,1765809.0
17,"/i:/. And so Latin was like, 'Look, I've got five vowels, they come in long and short versions,",1765810.0,1771379.0
17,"but that's pretty easy, so I'm just going to have five vowel letters.' And Old English",1771380.0,1776649.0
17,had pretty,1776650.0,1777649.0
17,much five vowels and long and short versions! And so five vowel letters was very reasonable.,1777650.0,1784189.0
17,And then this vowel,1784190.0,1785499.0
17,"shift happened and now your long /e:/ is being pronounced /i/, and your long /i:/ being pronounced",1785500.0,1792849.0
17,"/ai/, and the short -- L: But you still only got five letters to",1792850.0,1796329.0
17,write it with! G: I know! And they have so little relationship with each other except,1796330.0,1800909.0
17,"historically! L: Yup. G: And it just -- like, that's why English spelling is so completely",1800910.0,1808109.0
17,weird. Partly because of this,1808110.0,1809599.0
17,thing that happened in the Middle Ages when a whole bunch of vowels shifted and we kept,1809600.0,1813538.0
17,"writing them the same way, because the writing system was already established. And then,",1813539.0,1818499.0
17,because this thing on top of it where now we have a whole bunch of different varieties,1818500.0,1821288.0
17,of,1821289.0,1822288.0
17,"English and a lot of them are undergoing their own separate vowel shifts, and they're still",1822289.0,1826339.0
17,all being written the same way. L: Which brings us to a really interesting,1826340.0,1829219.0
17,"question, which is how does the IPA deal with vowels? Because we have this infinite possibility",1829220.0,1835799.0
17,"of spaces where vowels could be, but we have to write them in some way, and obviously the",1835800.0,1840779.0
17,English system is not going to work. G: The English system is not going to,1840780.0,1845279.0
17,"work. And you do see this sometimes, so sometimes if you see languages that have been written",1845280.0,1849889.0
17,with other writing systems -- they get,1849890.0,1852589.0

17,"romanisation happened, sometimes the romanisation will use English conventions. So, for",1855710.0,1859849.0
17,"example, if you think of the Chinese last name 'Lee,' sometimes it's written L-E-E,",1859850.0,1865058.0
17,"which is using the English convention, that double-e stands for the /i/ sound. And sometimes",1865059.0,1870788.0
17,"that same last name is written L-I, which is using a different convention that the",1870789.0,1875339.0
17,"letter 'I', which in every other language that uses the Roman alphabet, you know, French",1875340.0,1879019.0
17,"and Spanish and so on, that's what that letter stands for. So you can look at transcription",1879020.0,1886249.0
17,"systems and say, 'Okay, was this person using an English perspective or an international,",1886250.0,1892379.0
17,Latin-based,1892380.0,1893379.0
17,perspective when they were romanising this particular writing system?' And the IPA does,1893380.0,1897859.0
17,this too. L: And the IPA has picked the most common salient points on the space in terms,1897860.0,1905109.0
17,of whether it's near,1905110.0,1906109.0
17,"the front or the back, and also whether the lips are rounded or not. So the difference",1906110.0,1911030.0

17,"together in a rounded -- G: Making a circle! L: -- thing or not. Yeah. G: Yeah, so the",1918070.0,1923239.0
17,"IPA does take this international perspective, so when you're learning the IPA vowels, if",1923240.0,1928069.0
17,"you speak, you know, literally any other language that uses",1928070.0,1931279.0
17,"the Roman alphabet, Spanish being one of them or Italian or something, the regular-looking",1931280.0,1936249.0
17,"vowels in the IPA look very familiar. So you'll have, like, 'café' is a perfectly good IPA",1936250.0,1943209.0
17,"word except for the 'C' at the beginning, because 'C' is weird. But the 'a' and the",1943210.0,1949200.0
17,'é' are IPA-ish. Whereas 'coffee' gets written completely differently in IPA because they're,1949201.0,1954759.0
17,"like, 'Look, English did this weird thing in the Middle Ages, but we're not going to",1954760.0,1957949.0
17,do it like that for an international standard.' Which means that it's really,1957950.0,1961808.0
17,"weird as an English speaker, because you learn to read IPA and you're like, 'Wow, this is",1961809.0,1965729.0
17,"so weird and difficult!' And then you try to read IPA Spanish and you're like, 'This",1965730.0,1969768.0
17,is strangely easy and I'm suspicious of,1969769.0,1971629.0
17,how easy it is.' L: And it's because when you use more than just the five vowels and,1971630.0,1977439.0
17,'Y' that we have in our writing,1977440.0,1980249.0
17,system (and 'W') you begin to realise that English has way more than five vowels. English,1980250.0,1985529.0
17,"has, like,",1985530.0,1986529.0
17,"twelve vowels, which makes it -- G: Or fourteen! Depends on the dialect! L: Or fourteen, depending",1986530.0,1990649.0
17,on how much merging are doing. Which makes it one of the largest vowel,1990650.0,1994339.0
17,"inventories cross-linguistically. G: Yeah! So, English has a pretty normal amount of",1994340.0,2000259.0
17,"consonants, but it's got a very large vowel inventory because it has this weird split",2000260.0,2005599.0
17,with the long vowels,2005600.0,2006599.0

17,generally considered to have three,2010500.0,2011658.0
17,"vowels, /a/, /i/, and /u/. L: Yep. G: And then it also has long versions of all of those.",2011659.0,2017408.0
17,But that's still really kind of three vowels plus length. L: A lot of Australian Indigenous,2017409.0,2022099.0
17,"languages have only three vowels, but what that means is that there's a lot more variation",2022100.0,2027219.0
17,in how you can pronounce them. So if you,2027220.0,2029349.0
17,"only have an /i/, /a/, and /o/, your /a/ could be, like, anywhere",2029350.0,2035518.0
17,-- it's a much larger house that it's living in in the,2035519.0,2038499.0

17,"language like English,",2044820.0,2045819.0

17,it was like the first non-general Latin alphabet vowel that,2170431.0,2175149.0
17,made sense to me. G: Yeah. And one of the cool things about vowels as a space is that,2175150.0,2180088.0
17,languages tend to make efficient use of the space. So you get a fair number of languages,2180089.0,2188399.0
17,that have five vowels or have,2188400.0,2189538.0
17,"three vowels, and when a language has just five or three vowels, it tends to be the same",2189539.0,2194159.0

18,historical anecdote in my family that kind of explains where denotation and,1868639.0,1875178.0
18,"connotation are in tension. So as I've mentioned, my grandmother is",1875179.0,1879439.0
18,an English second language speaker. G: Mm-hmm. L: I've,1879440.0,1881499.0

18,"school in English, and they wanted to kind of fit in with the other kids. And",1898049.0,1903719.0
18,so the denotation of a sandwich is very simple: it's two pieces of bread with,1903720.0,1908128.0

18,"when we have these ideas of untranslatable words, we're trying to",1978710.0,1982579.0

20,beginning of the Australian national identity that we,734780.0,740070.0
20,know now.,740071.0,742319.0
20,The thing about Australian English,742320.0,744619.0
20,"is that people often use the 'melting pot' analogy, where you had a lot",744620.0,750129.0

20,backgrounds.,766150.0,767439.0
20,And there's this thing called dialect levelling where,767440.0,770669.0
20,it doesn't take very long for the children to kind of even all of,770670.0,773469.0
20,that out and establish some kind of general,773470.0,775869.0
20,accent.,775870.0,777889.0
20,What's quite interesting is that there's quite,777890.0,779199.0
20,a lack of accent diversity compared to places like the UK and the,779200.0,783529.0
20,"US, and that's largely because it wasn't long after those early colonies",783530.0,788239.0
20,were started that you get things like radio and the,788240.0,791439.0
20,telephone and media that means you get less of that accent drift,791440.0,796809.0
20,that you get in places that were,796810.0,798809.0
20,"really, really isolated for sometimes centuries.",798810.0,802369.0
20,And so we have accents that are mostly really,802370.0,806409.0
20,"broadly, to grossly oversimplify, accents based on class.",806410.0,811249.0
20,So you have a broad accent that,811250.0,813839.0
20,normally,813840.0,814839.0
20,"correlates with people in the country, you have a middle accent, and we",814840.0,817909.0
20,used to have this really,817910.0,818909.0
20,fancy accent that sounded like a British BBC,818910.0,821569.0
20,"presenter, but we don't really have that anymore.",821570.0,824049.0
20,So I,824050.0,825049.0
20,"speak a fairly urban, well-educated variety of English.",825050.0,828069.0
20,And that's how we got to here!,828070.0,830069.0
20,"G: Okay, so",830070.0,831149.0
20,"I think I knew some of that, but I",831150.0,832329.0
20,definitely didn't know so much how all the pieces fit together.,832330.0,834799.0
20,"L: So, I feel like Canada has -- I always think of Canada as",834800.0,839369.0
20,"having a relatively similar story to Australia, just with a little bit more",839370.0,843239.0

20,border.,848380.0,849379.0
20,"G: Yeah, there's definitely a certain amount of similarity.",849380.0,851319.0
20,There were a pretty similar,851320.0,852369.0
20,number of aboriginal languages first spoken in Canada before,852370.0,856369.0
20,European settlers started arriving.,856370.0,858109.0
20,The number that I able to find is 296 indigenous,858110.0,861709.0
20,"languages spoken, or formerly spoken, in the US",861710.0,864119.0
20,"and Canada combined, and the number for Canada that I'm able to",864120.0,867249.0
20,find is over 70 currently spoken.,867250.0,869989.0
20,So there's some sort of gap between how,869990.0,872449.0
20,"many were formerly spoken in Canada, but those statistics",872450.0,875239.0
20,don't seem to be readily available.,875240.0,876249.0
20,L: I guess also the national boundary between the US and Canada,876250.0,880169.0
20,"is an arbitrary, post-colonisation exercise",880170.0,883179.0
20,rather than anything that reflected the reality that,883180.0,885349.0
20,was there before.,885350.0,886349.0
20,"G: Right, exactly, so there's a bunch of languages",886350.0,887999.0
20,that are spoken across the,888000.0,888999.0
20,"border, so maybe more accurate to talk about them",889000.0,891189.0
20,as a whole in terms of aboriginal languages.,891190.0,893879.0
20,So,893880.0,894879.0
20,the main thing that's responsible for the mainstream,894880.0,897989.0
20,Canadian accent as we think of it and the,897990.0,899859.0
20,reason that Canadian English sounds to a lot of people very similar to,899860.0,903649.0
20,"American English, is that a",903650.0,906129.0
20,lot of European settlers in Ontario were,906130.0,910429.0
20,"originally United Empire Loyalists, who were people who,",910430.0,914139.0

20,don't want no revolution.',916370.0,917689.0
20,And so they went across the border to what was then,917690.0,920459.0
20,"the British Territories in what's now Canada, and",920460.0,922809.0
20,especially in what's now southern Ontario.,922810.0,925409.0
20,"And so a lot of them settled there, and they spoke very",925410.0,927799.0
20,similarly to how their neighbours had in the US.,927800.0,930249.0
20,L: Right.,930250.0,931249.0
20,G: But they had a different ideological,931250.0,933609.0
20,alignment to their neighbours in the south.,933610.0,937199.0
20,"And so when they were looking to linguistic models,",937200.0,939849.0
20,"they weren't looking to this kind of, like,",939850.0,941309.0
20,"Noah Webster spelling reform stuff, they were looking",941310.0,944689.0
20,"to, well, you know, let's import some more British subjects from",944690.0,948709.0
20,the UK and keep going with this,948710.0,950849.0
20,British thing to maintain this British ideology,950850.0,954179.0
20,on Canada.,954180.0,955719.0
20,But very similar to what happened in,955720.0,957049.0
20,"Australia, there was a kind of dialect levelling where kids tend to",957050.0,959699.0
20,talk like the other kids on the playground.,959700.0,962039.0
20,And so if you can get a founding population of those kids that,962040.0,964629.0
20,"talk a particular way,",964630.0,966479.0
20,"they'll still talk like each other, so at an oral level,",966480.0,969319.0
20,the language still sounds very similar to,969320.0,971399.0
20,"what it is in the US, but at a spelling level, and in some cases at a",971400.0,974899.0
20,"word level, things get",974900.0,976079.0

20,"G: Yeah, so a",979900.0,980899.0
20,"lot of the settlers that headed west of Canada, you know, into the",980900.0,984399.0

20,"middle of Canada, all the way towards the west -- although there",1010101.0,1011699.0

21,the psychology department.,166670.0,167988.0
21,S: Yes.,167989.0,168988.0

21,linguistics to ending up in a psych department?,170739.0,174049.0
21,"S: So I made the transition from classical and formal linguistics, where I",174050.0,179809.0
21,"was interested in the history of words, to psycholinguistics after a long and",179810.0,185869.0
21,detailed research project on the way that people used to use prepositions to,185870.0,190958.0
21,talk about time in the Middle Ages in English.,190959.0,194719.0
21,And I was very interested in seeing if I could see how the meanings,194720.0,197539.0
21,"of those words changed over time, but realised that when I was working with",197540.0,201839.0
21,these old languages there were these gaps between one text and the next that,201840.0,205548.0
21,"were sometimes 600 years long, and that what I was missing was the transition",205549.0,211279.0
21,from one person to another.,211280.0,213559.0
21,And that's where meaning change I think,213560.0,215018.0
21,"really happens, when one community is shifting slightly in this small time",215019.0,220498.0
21,scale.,220499.0,221498.0
21,"And so obviously the only way to study this was to work with babies, who",221499.0,225369.0
21,are learning their words for the first time.,225370.0,227529.0
21,So the transition happened when I moved across to the University of Oxford,227530.0,231188.0
21,"to work in the Oxford BabyLab, where we were investigating all sorts of",231189.0,235229.0
21,things to do with how babies learn their words for the first time.,235230.0,237609.0
21,"L: Not growing babies, studying babies.",237610.0,239718.0
21,"S: Yes, we were investigating the way that living babies",239719.0,243308.0
21,who would come into the lab for a visit would process the sounds of,243309.0,247128.0
21,speech and how they were connecting up the meanings of different words together.,247129.0,251908.0
21,L: Cool!,251909.0,253028.0
21,"What was it like going from studying medieval manuscripts to actual,",253029.0,257819.0
21,"real-life, tiny humans?",257820.0,259589.0
21,It's a bit of an adjustment!,259590.0,260589.0
21,S: It was fabulous.,260590.0,263369.0
21,"Again, it was moving from a more theoretical to a more",263370.0,266119.0
21,"people-oriented practice, which I sort of see coming back again and again in my",266120.0,270619.0
21,"work every time I get hyper-theoretical, I come back to people and I find them",270620.0,274159.0
21,far more interesting.,274160.0,275228.0
21,L: So what were you studying the babies for in Oxford?,275229.0,279769.0
21,"S: So, this was my PhD research,",279770.0,284168.0
21,and what I was working on was how babies connect up the different items in their,284169.0,290008.0
21,growing lexicon.,290009.0,291639.0
21,"So when a baby learns one or ten or twenty different words, what",291640.0,296749.0
21,"we're curious about is when they start to have, in the organisation of their",296750.0,302818.0
21,"lexicon, when they start to organise those words according to what they mean",302819.0,306848.0
21,or how they go together.,306849.0,307848.0
21,L: Okay.,307849.0,308848.0
21,S: So we could imagine one child is learning a word,308849.0,311879.0
21,"like 'cat,' and a word like 'table,' and a word like 'dog.'",311880.0,315279.0
21,L: Yeah.,315280.0,316378.0
21,S: And for most adults the words 'cat' and 'dog' go together in a,316379.0,319628.0
21,way that 'cat' and 'table' do not.,319629.0,322228.0
21,"But similarly, if the same child is learning",322229.0,324869.0
21,'cat' and 'table' and 'car' -- the cat and the car share something that they don't,324870.0,331619.0
21,share with the table.,331620.0,332918.0
21,So there's a sound-based relationship and a meaning-based,332919.0,336339.0
21,relationship.,336340.0,337339.0
21,"So we were working on a method called 'priming,' where what we're",337340.0,341848.0
21,able to do is see whether children can understand the meaning of one word,341849.0,347198.0
21,slightly more quickly if they've just heard another word that's related to,347199.0,351008.0
21,that one.,351009.0,352008.0
21,L: Okay.,352009.0,353008.0
21,How would you prime me if I was an infant learning?,353009.0,354999.0
21,S: So what I might do is I might give you a picture-finding,355000.0,357908.0
21,task.,357909.0,358908.0
21,L: Okay.,358909.0,359908.0
21,S: So I'm going to put on the screen in front of you a picture,359909.0,361818.0
21,of a cat and a boat.,361819.0,365229.0
21,L: Right.,365230.0,366229.0
21,S: And your job is going to be to find the cat.,366230.0,370719.0
21,"And so before I say the word 'cat,' I give you",370720.0,373899.0
21,just some language that's completely unrelated to the task.,373900.0,376628.0
21,L: Okay.,376629.0,377628.0
21,S: So it might go something like this: 'Yesterday I saw a,377629.0,380888.0
21,dog.,380889.0,381888.0
21,Cat!',381889.0,382888.0
21,And then the pictures appear.,382889.0,383888.0
21,"L: Oh, okay!",383889.0,384888.0
21,"That was very sudden, I was just sitting here looking at a screen and",384889.0,387019.0
21,suddenly there's dogs and cats and...,387020.0,389728.0
21,S: Yeah.,389729.0,391189.0
21,So what we found in those studies is between the age of one-and-a-half and,391190.0,397489.0
21,"two years of age, children get faster at finding the named picture if it was",397490.0,404348.0
21,preceded by a word that's related to it.,404349.0,406788.0
21,L: Okay.,406789.0,407848.0
21,"S: Compared to if we had a different condition where we said, 'Yesterday I ate",407849.0,414119.0
21,an apple.,414120.0,415379.0
21,Cat!',415380.0,416379.0
21,"L: Right, yeah.",416380.0,417899.0
21,S: Yeah.,417900.0,419159.0
21,L: Talking about eating an apple does not prime me to think about cats at all.,419160.0,423138.0
21,S: Right.,423139.0,424138.0
21,"So we found very reliable evidence, and this effect has been replicated",424139.0,429019.0
21,"a couple of different times in a couple of different age groups, and the method",429020.0,432559.0
21,of priming in early childhood is now being used for all sorts of different,432560.0,437619.0
21,aspects of the way that children connect up their lexicons.,437620.0,440478.0
21,L: Okay!,440479.0,441598.0
21,"So, learning words is a complicated task and we",441599.0,445330.0
21,sometimes draw on meaning and we sometimes draw a bit on sound as well.,445331.0,449388.0
21,S: Yeah!,449389.0,450388.0
21,But it's interesting that at the very early stages of development we see,450389.0,454079.0
21,the same organisational properties for how those words work together as we see,454080.0,459079.0
21,in adults.,459080.0,460138.0
21,"So the structure is there right from the start, and that's really",460139.0,462869.0
21,exciting.,462870.0,463869.0
21,"L: I think it's worth, like, always making clear in these things that",463870.0,469158.0
21,the kids are hearing these sentences long before they can clearly,469159.0,471679.0
21,"say, 'Yesterday, I saw a cat.'",471680.0,473638.0
21,"You know, they're probably not saying it quite",473639.0,476638.0
21,that sophisticatedly.,476639.0,477638.0
21,S: Yeah.,477639.0,478638.0
21,L: But being able to comprehend things always outstrips,478639.0,482598.0
21,production in these things.,482599.0,483859.0
21,S: Yes.,483860.0,485109.0
21,"And for our one-and-a-half-year-olds, it was clear",485110.0,487339.0
21,"that although they understood almost all of the words in the test, they were",487340.0,492418.0
21,saying very few of them at that stage.,492419.0,495309.0
21,And yet we were still seeing this evidence from the way that they moved,495310.0,499059.0
21,their eyes while they were looking for these pictures that even in,499060.0,503258.0

21,They can't even say a whole sentence yet!',517310.0,519629.0
21,But it is pretty impressive And so you,519630.0,522679.0
21,use gaze tracking to test those?,522680.0,526119.0
21,"S: Yeah, this was still in the old days where the only way to do",526120.0,530059.0
21,"gaze tracking was, realistically, to record the children's eye movements",530060.0,533939.0

21,L: Okay!,542139.0,543138.0

21,"contains a couple of cameras and some little infrared lights that flash, and",563150.0,568669.0
21,what they do is they flash their little light onto the baby's eyes and you can,568670.0,574539.0

21,And so from there...,590620.0,593729.0

21,So where did we go from there?,600430.0,603849.0
21,S: So I guess one of the things that I was very aware of in Oxford was,603850.0,610448.0
21,that the vast majority of babies that lived in our region were English-only,610449.0,616149.0
21,babies.,616150.0,617149.0

21,L: Mm-hmm.,631490.0,632489.0
21,S: And probably several.,632490.0,633489.0
21,L: Yeah.,633490.0,634489.0
21,"S: So being monolingual is actually a bit abnormal,",634490.0,638229.0

21,L: Right.,729870.0,730869.0
21,S: So because the equipment that we use and the laboratory settings,730870.0,734749.0
21,"that we use are often very tightly controlled, the people that we work",734750.0,738929.0

21,L: Yeah.,748820.0,749819.0
21,"S: So in my transition between these worlds, when I was looking",749820.0,754379.0
21,"at the groups of people who lived around Oxford, there were lots of people who",754380.0,758939.0
21,"were growing up in bilingual households, but each bi- or multilingual household",758940.0,763159.0
21,was unique and different from the ones around it.,763160.0,766109.0
21,And I saw this fabulous opportunity to look at what was going on,766110.0,769208.0
21,"in Singapore, which is a country that has four official languages and more",769209.0,776349.0
21,"varieties of language that are spoken in the home, and it's perfectly normal for",776350.0,781469.0

21,"aren't just in English, it's kind of just a normal part of life, and you are weird",800230.0,805579.0
21,if you're a monolingual.,805580.0,807088.0
21,S: Mmm!,807089.0,808289.0
21,"Yeah, so making the transition over towards",808290.0,811219.0
21,"Singapore, I was asking myself these questions about what are the things we",811220.0,814989.0
21,don't yet know about the process of being bi- or a,814990.0,819828.0
21,multilingual.,819829.0,820828.0
21,And there are a few labs that are investigating the development of babies,820829.0,823409.0
21,"in bi- and multilingual communities, most of the work that's currently being done",823410.0,829028.0
21,"tends to be in very early childhood, focusing on the way that babies' hearing",829029.0,835219.0
21,develops in line with the languages that they hear around them when they're very,835220.0,839508.0
21,young.,839509.0,840508.0
21,L: And we've talked about that in a couple of episodes.,840509.0,842499.0
21,"We introduced people to the very sophisticated, actually very",842500.0,846069.0
21,"serious methodology of high-amplitude sucking in an earlier episode, and we've",846070.0,852769.0
21,"talked a little bit about it with vowels as well, how people acquire, well before",852770.0,857439.0
21,"they're even aware that their brain is doing this, the kind of sound set that",857440.0,860729.0
21,their language has.,860730.0,862099.0
21,S: Mmm.,862100.0,863479.0
21,So I guess what I was interested in is thinking beyond just,863480.0,867079.0
21,the sound system on its own and asking myself this question of whether the,867080.0,875139.0
21,sound system changes cause other changes as well.,875140.0,879369.0
21,"So what I mean by that is, if children over the second half of their",879370.0,884799.0
21,first year of life change the way that their brain is representing acoustic,884800.0,889299.0
21,information so that it forms up neatly into categories that are aligned with,889300.0,894099.0
21,"the adults from their speech community, if that change is going on at a very",894100.0,899568.0
21,"deep level in the auditory cortex, then maybe the way they process other sensations is",899569.0,906258.0
21,also influenced by the way that their hearing is changing.,906259.0,910119.0
21,L: Right.,910120.0,911278.0
21,"So we have the brain kind of going, 'These are the sounds",911279.0,914599.0
21,"you've been hearing, these are the sounds in the language,' kind of re-molding",914600.0,918879.0
21,itself to fit that.,918880.0,920828.0
21,And then there is some relationship between how humans,920829.0,924609.0
21,think about the sounds that they hear and other senses that could,924610.0,929458.0
21,vary because of that brain re-organising.,929459.0,932409.0
21,S: Mmm!,932410.0,933888.0
21,So I'm very interested in the idea of multi-sensory processing.,933889.0,939268.0
21,And this is the idea that when we hear some sounds,939269.0,941378.0
21,"in the world, they kind of go better with some visual kinds of information than",941379.0,948479.0
21,others.,948480.0,949479.0
21,Or they go better with some objects in the world than,949480.0,951778.0
21,"others, and we know this and we learn this as children at a very deep level,",951779.0,957679.0
21,"these relationships exist in the world outside us, and where we can be aware of",957680.0,963189.0
21,those kinds of relationships.,963190.0,965309.0
21,"So, would you like me to give you an example?",965310.0,967179.0
21,L: Okay!,967180.0,968179.0
21,S: Okay!,968180.0,969179.0
21,So if I ask our listeners to imagine for a moment that I'm holding in my hand a,969180.0,975689.0
21,"staple and I'm going to drop it on a hard table, I think all of us can imagine",975690.0,981819.0
21,the kind of noise that that staple is going to make when it makes contact with,981820.0,984969.0
21,the table.,984970.0,985969.0
21,L: Mm-hmm.,985970.0,986969.0
21,S: So to describe its acoustic features: it's going to be a high,986970.0,989719.0
21,"frequency sound, so it's going to have high pitch elements, it's going to be",989720.0,994758.0
21,"quite quiet, and it's going to be quite short-lasting.",994759.0,997299.0
21,"So tkt-tkt-tkt-tkt-tkt, something like that.",997300.0,1000119.0
21,L: Mm-hmm.,1000120.0,1001119.0
21,S: Now if you imagine that I drop the stapler...,1001120.0,1007088.0
21,you can already -- L: That's going to make a very different sound!,1007089.0,1009179.0
21,"S: Yeah, it's gonna make a very different sound!",1009180.0,1011189.0
21,L: I might come and ask what you're doing with my stapler!,1011190.0,1014578.0
21,S: Yeah!,1014579.0,1015958.0
21,But the properties that are going to be,1015959.0,1018849.0
21,"different here are there are going to be more low-frequency elements in the sound, it's",1018850.0,1023638.0
21,"going to be lower pitched, it's going to be louder.",1023639.0,1026139.0
21,L: Yes.,1026140.0,1027139.0
21,S: And it's going to be a longer-lasting sound.,1027140.0,1029069.0
21,L: Mm-hmm.,1029070.0,1030069.0
21,S: So what we've got already is this idea that for,1030070.0,1034009.0
21,"objects in the world that are small, the sounds that go along with them are going",1034010.0,1039199.0
21,"to be high-frequency, quiet, and short-lasting.",1039200.0,1041038.0
21,L: Okay.,1041039.0,1042038.0
21,Like a small dog is gonna yap and a big dog is gonna bark is the kind,1042039.0,1046439.0
21,of perception that we have.,1046440.0,1048668.0
21,S: Yeah!,1048669.0,1049668.0
21,"And if we extend that even wider in the animal kingdom, we can think about",1049669.0,1053908.0
21,elephants and mosquitoes.,1053909.0,1055349.0
21,"L: That is a lot wider, yeah!",1055350.0,1058089.0
21,S: Yeah.,1058090.0,1059339.0
21,L: Imagine a world in which mosquitoes made the noise of,1059340.0,1063089.0
21,elephants and elephants made the noise of mosquitoes.,1063090.0,1066199.0
21,That would be amazing.,1066200.0,1067199.0
21,"S: Right, and we can make, actually, a very clean prediction about this.",1067200.0,1071558.0
21,If we grew up in a world where that were the,1071559.0,1073308.0
21,"case, we would expect babies to learn that really, really early on.",1073309.0,1079699.0
21,L: Mm-hmm!,1079700.0,1080699.0
21,'Cause you'd want to stay out of the way of,1080700.0,1081699.0
21,those high-buzzing elephants.,1081700.0,1083679.0
21,"S: Yeah, and in fact there's a very good evolutionary story that suggests that if",1083680.0,1089048.0
21,"a brain can make these connections, or is possibly even born with these",1089049.0,1093439.0
21,"connections, then it has a higher chance of surviving in the world.",1093440.0,1096249.0
21,L: Right.,1096250.0,1097289.0
21,S: Even frogs seem to know about this kind of,1097290.0,1101959.0
21,relationship.,1101960.0,1102959.0
21,L: Is that why they all pretend to be bigger by having really,1102960.0,1104759.0
21,big voices?,1104760.0,1105908.0
21,"S: Yeah, it seems that lady frogs find that very appealing in a",1105909.0,1111329.0
21,gentleman frog.,1111330.0,1112329.0
21,L: Right.,1112330.0,1113329.0
21,So gentlemen frogs have figured out the game.,1113330.0,1116129.0
21,S: Yeah!,1116130.0,1117129.0
21,"So once we know about this relationship, and we know that",1117130.0,1119089.0
21,"hearing is connected to vision in a way that makes sense in the world, when we",1119090.0,1123599.0
21,think about the baby side and we know that babies are learning about the sound,1123600.0,1128719.0
21,"patterns in their world, if the sound pattern in one language is different",1128720.0,1133449.0
21,"from another, maybe it influences the way that the sounds are connected to other",1133450.0,1140499.0
21,sensory pieces of information.,1140500.0,1141849.0
21,"L: Okay, so this is kind of getting into the idea",1141850.0,1144619.0
21,that -- because in linguistics we spend a lot of time teaching adults --,1144620.0,1147879.0
21,"undergraduates, whoever -- but we teach people that words are arbitrary, is the",1147880.0,1153279.0
21,"fancy terminology we use, but, like, there's no reason why 'dog' should be 'dog,'",1153280.0,1157369.0
21,"it could be any other combination of sounds, it is other combinations of",1157370.0,1160999.0
21,sounds in all the world's languages.,1161000.0,1162808.0
21,S: Mm.,1162809.0,1163808.0
21,L: But what you're saying is because we,1163809.0,1165499.0
21,inevitably can never separate language from the physical world in which we,1165500.0,1169629.0
21,"speak it, perhaps that is not as entirely arbitrary as all that, that",1169630.0,1175658.0
21,there might be some patterns happening.,1175659.0,1177769.0
21,"S: So yeah, at the very most basic level, there's an idea that some sounds in",1177770.0,1183558.0
21,"language might go better with some meanings, or some other sensory",1183559.0,1188739.0
21,experiences in the world.,1188740.0,1189969.0
21,"L: Okay, yep.",1189970.0,1190969.0
21,S: So the classic test for this is known as the bouba/kiki,1190970.0,1194939.0
21,test.,1194940.0,1195939.0
21,L: Should we do the test?,1195940.0,1197369.0

21,So what I would like our listeners to do today is first of,1207020.0,1210259.0
21,all to imagine in their mind a shape that is really angular and,1210260.0,1216349.0
21,pointy around the edges.,1216350.0,1218139.0
21,So a nice sharp shape.,1218140.0,1220408.0
21,"And I'm now I'm going to describe a second shape, and this shape is going",1220409.0,1224519.0
21,to be very curvy and rounded around the edges.,1224520.0,1229439.0
21,"L: If you have no imagination, we'll have pictures of both of these images in",1229440.0,1234379.0
21,the show notes.,1234380.0,1235379.0
21,You can go look at those while you're hearing about them and,1235380.0,1238939.0
21,"deciding what -- so, what do we do next with these two shapes?",1238940.0,1241129.0
21,"S: Okay, so we've got two shapes in mind and now I'm going to",1241130.0,1244139.0
21,introduce you to two names for these shapes.,1244140.0,1246538.0
21,L: Okay.,1246539.0,1247538.0
21,S: And each of you individually can just make up your own mind which,1247539.0,1250369.0
21,label you think is a better name for which of the shapes.,1250370.0,1254989.0
21,L: Okay.,1254990.0,1255989.0
21,"S: So we've got two shapes, one spiky one, one curvy one.",1255990.0,1258209.0
21,L: And I'm gonna name my shapes.,1258210.0,1261439.0
21,S: Yes.,1261440.0,1262789.0
21,So!,1262790.0,1263789.0
21,The first name is 'maluma.',1263790.0,1268039.0
21,The second name is 'takete.',1268040.0,1273749.0
21,L: Okay.,1273750.0,1276259.0
21,"I'm gonna tell you what name I gave to each of my shapes,",1276260.0,1280418.0
21,and you can decide if your description matches or if it doesn't.,1280419.0,1284829.0
21,"So our blobby, roundy thing, that's called 'maluma.'",1284830.0,1291999.0
21,"And our spiky thing, that's called 'takete.'",1292000.0,1296009.0
21,S: And that's the way they feel for you?,1296010.0,1298079.0
21,"L: That's how they feel for me, that makes sense.",1298080.0,1301048.0
21,In some way.,1301049.0,1302439.0
21,S: Okay.,1302440.0,1303719.0
21,"L: Totally spontaneous response here, I have not",1303720.0,1306539.0
21,done this test 100 times.,1306540.0,1309739.0
21,S: Perhaps our listeners could tell us via Twitter,1309740.0,1316058.0
21,whether or not their sensory perceptions agreed?,1316059.0,1318459.0
21,"L: And if you disagree, I mean if you agreed with me, please let me know,",1318460.0,1322429.0
21,for validation.,1322430.0,1323429.0
21,"If you didn't agree, you can also let us know.",1323430.0,1325038.0
21,S: We can also put it in as a little Twitter quiz to go alongside.,1325039.0,1327319.0
21,"L: Oh, yeah, we'll have a Twitter quiz, that'll be fun.",1327320.0,1330469.0
21,Yeah.,1330470.0,1331469.0
21,S: So the answer that Lauren has just given us is the,1331470.0,1334619.0
21,answer that 90% of people give when they're given this task.,1334620.0,1341219.0
21,This is one of the strongest effects that has ever been,1341220.0,1343509.0
21,documented in the field of psychology or possibly linguistics.,1343510.0,1348359.0
21,L: Huh!,1348360.0,1349359.0
21,S: Where almost everyone agrees on the same,1349360.0,1351879.0
21,direction of the match.,1351880.0,1354989.0
21,It's incredibly powerful.,1354990.0,1356989.0
21,"This effect has been known for almost a hundred years, and it's been",1356990.0,1360778.0
21,"replicated many, many times and in lots of different languages and in lots of",1360779.0,1364599.0
21,different contexts.,1364600.0,1366569.0
21,"So this bouba/kiki effect, as it's now known, is considered to be something that",1366570.0,1372058.0
21,is universal.,1372059.0,1373679.0
21,L: Except... we...,1373680.0,1376109.0
21,broke it?,1376110.0,1377729.0
21,"S: Yeah, this is the point where we get to ask this fabulous",1377730.0,1383259.0
21,question that says if the sounds that we learn as children are different from,1383260.0,1386839.0
21,"each other, do effects like the bouba/kiki effect",1386840.0,1390038.0
21,"really apply, or were all of those replications over nearly a hundred years,",1390039.0,1394658.0
21,"were they all biased by being tested on WEIRD populations, not non-WEIRD ones?",1394659.0,1400408.0
21,"L: So, I heard you talking about this stuff in --",1400409.0,1404278.0
21,"I don't even think it was in a seminar, I think we were just out to lunch with",1404279.0,1407808.0
21,"people, and you were telling them how you were looking at bouba and kiki, starting to",1407809.0,1412259.0
21,"look at it in children, but you were also looking at how it relates to Mandarin",1412260.0,1417329.0
21,tone (and we'll talk about that).,1417330.0,1418489.0
21,S: Mm.,1418490.0,1419489.0
21,"L: I kind of came to you and said, 'I'm working with this other",1419490.0,1422538.0
21,"tone language called Syuba in Nepal, it's got Tibetan tone, there's two tones, and I",1422539.0,1428939.0
21,think people have a different idea about what's a high tone and what's a low tone,1428940.0,1433439.0
21,"to how I conceptualise it,' and that's how we hit upon doing this study together,",1433440.0,1438369.0
21,looking at the relationship between tone and other senses.,1438370.0,1441399.0
21,"But we had to do a kiki/bouba first just to check, because it's",1441400.0,1444979.0
21,universal.,1444980.0,1445979.0
21,We wanted to make sure that our participants were doing what,1445980.0,1448319.0
21,everyone else did.,1448320.0,1449399.0
21,And then I wrote to you after we ran the experiment,1449400.0,1453028.0
21,"in Nepal and I was like, 'It didn't work?",1453029.0,1456069.0
21,I thought this was meant to be the easy part of the,1456070.0,1458788.0
21,experiment!',1458789.0,1461219.0
21,Something went wrong!,1461220.0,1462669.0
21,S: It was deeply mysterious!,1462670.0,1466528.0
21,Everything in the literature on this effect shows,1466529.0,1468969.0
21,"that it's highly replicable, it keeps happening over and over again, and it",1468970.0,1472709.0
21,"seemed, at the time, not to matter what language you went to; everyone showed the",1472710.0,1476579.0
21,same effect.,1476580.0,1477928.0
21,"So we went back and looked at the literature and thought, 'Is there",1477929.0,1481199.0
21,anything we've missed?',1481200.0,1482668.0
21,And there was one paper.,1482669.0,1486849.0
21,Just one!,1486850.0,1487849.0
21,A glorious paper from 1975.,1487850.0,1490389.0
21,"L: It's, like, one page long, right?",1490390.0,1492898.0
21,"S: Yeah, it's only about 350 words!",1492899.0,1495558.0
21,And it was another fieldwork study with a group of people,1495559.0,1501999.0
21,"living in a remote community, this time in Papua New Guinea rather than Nepal,",1502000.0,1505769.0
21,which is where Lauren you went to.,1505770.0,1507849.0
21,L: Yeah.,1507850.0,1508849.0
21,S: So we tried to figure out whether there was anything that was similar,1508850.0,1514369.0
21,about what we'd done in Nepal and what this other paper from 1975 had shown in,1514370.0,1522028.0
21,Papua New Guinea.,1522029.0,1523308.0
21,So we sort of scratched our heads a bit and tried to figure it,1523309.0,1526819.0
21,"out, and then Lauren, I think it was your analysis of the words we put together --",1526820.0,1531278.0
21,L: Yeah.,1531279.0,1532278.0
21,S: -- that helped us solve the problem.,1532279.0,1533278.0
21,"L: So we used 'kiki' and 'booboo' as, like, close",1533279.0,1537109.0
21,"enough because there's not that o-u, /ou/ kind of sound in the language, and I",1537110.0,1543689.0
21,"said, you know, these are perfectly fine, and I could get someone to say them, but",1543690.0,1548459.0
21,they're not good words in the language.,1548460.0,1550849.0
21,"Like, these sounds all exist, but you wouldn't have this 'kiki' sound in the",1550850.0,1555249.0
21,middle of a word.,1555250.0,1556249.0
21,S: Mmm.,1556250.0,1557249.0
21,"L: And the tone doesn't quite work like that, tone works a bit differently to how",1557250.0,1562269.0
21,it was structured to make the words sound like 'kiki' and 'booboo.',1562270.0,1566029.0
21,And we realized that even though we tried to,1566030.0,1568879.0
21,"make it exactly the same words as the other versions of the test, that had",1568880.0,1573779.0
21,"actually been the problem, is that these weren't words in the language.",1573780.0,1577869.0
21,"And from what we can tell, people were so",1577870.0,1580329.0
21,mystified by this weird sound.,1580330.0,1581859.0
21,"It would be like giving English speakers, like, /ŋy/",1581860.0,1585278.0
21,as a word.,1585279.0,1586278.0
21,"You'd be like, 'Oh, it kind of sounds a bit like a word, but not a very",1586279.0,1589939.0
21,good one.',1589940.0,1590939.0
21,And it kind of breaks your ability to do this kiki/bouba to shape,1590940.0,1595038.0
21,thing.,1595039.0,1596038.0
21,"S: So yeah, we suddenly come across this idea that if the combination of sounds",1596039.0,1602229.0
21,that you stick together is not really word-y...,1602230.0,1605469.0
21,L: That's the very scientific term we used in the paper.,1605470.0,1608689.0
21,S: Indeed.,1608690.0,1609689.0
21,"Our 'word wordy-ness,' I believe we called it.",1609690.0,1612469.0
21,Yeah!,1612470.0,1613469.0
21,So if your sound set of sounds together is,1613470.0,1615689.0
21,"not really word-y, then you lose the ability to do",1615690.0,1618579.0
21,all of those things that we normally do with words.,1618580.0,1621009.0
21,"So it makes it harder for us to learn words, and it makes it",1621010.0,1624528.0
21,harder for us to remember what we've just heard.,1624529.0,1627288.0
21,And it seems in this case it makes it harder for us to connect the,1627289.0,1631889.0
21,sounds in that word to some other sensation as well.,1631890.0,1634178.0
21,"L: And that's what happened as well in the Songe language,",1634179.0,1637889.0
21,"which was the other language from PNG with that other failure, is that they",1637890.0,1641528.0
21,"didn't have a 't' sound in the language, so they didn't have that /t/, so they",1641529.0,1645739.0
21,couldn't even say -- they used 'takete' for this.,1645740.0,1648469.0
21,"S: Takete and maluma, yeah.",1648470.0,1649989.0
21,"L: So, like, 'takete' -- that 't' wasn't even a sound.",1649990.0,1652898.0
21,S: And they also didn't have the /l/ sound.,1652899.0,1655549.0
21,L: Yeah.,1655550.0,1656549.0
21,S: Maluma.,1656550.0,1657549.0
21,So when we went back to the 1975 paper and we double-checked and we,1657550.0,1661189.0
21,"double-checked, and we found out that they had also used non-word-y words in",1661190.0,1667168.0
21,their test.,1667169.0,1668168.0
21,L: Yeah.,1668169.0,1669168.0
21,"S: So suddenly there are these two failures in the literature, and",1669169.0,1671569.0
21,both of them had non-word-y words.,1671570.0,1674528.0
21,So what this suggested to us was when we go,1674529.0,1678489.0
21,"through that process of learning how our language sounds, the way that the brain",1678490.0,1683639.0
21,adapts to the sound structure of the language kind of overflows outside of,1683640.0,1688908.0
21,just listening for understanding into everything we do with those sounds.,1688909.0,1692808.0
21,L: I have never been more excited to fail in,1692809.0,1695808.0
21,my life.,1695809.0,1696819.0
21,So great!,1696820.0,1698099.0
21,"S: Yeah, actually!",1698100.0,1700029.0
21,It was was very exciting.,1700030.0,1701509.0
21,L: So I hadn't realised that it was weird to work with non-WEIRD,1701510.0,1706069.0
21,"people, I hadn't realised -- well, I don't think either of us realised that you",1706070.0,1709669.0
21,"could break the kiki/bouba, maluma/takete",1709670.0,1712129.0
21,thing.,1712130.0,1713129.0
21,S: Mm.,1713130.0,1714129.0
21,L: And I hadn't realised that it was weird to suggest that we do this,1714130.0,1718018.0
21,"work on a language with tone, because you were doing some work on Mandarin.",1718019.0,1722528.0
21,But that's some of the first work that's,1722529.0,1725158.0
21,looked at this cross-sensory effect.,1725159.0,1728918.0
21,"And again it's just because, well, English",1728919.0,1731559.0
21,speakers will start with English and not think about the fact that many languages,1731560.0,1735289.0
21,have tone to mark the difference between words.,1735290.0,1739989.0
21,S: Mmm.,1739990.0,1741079.0
21,Are your listeners particularly familiar with tone languages and how they work?,1741080.0,1746129.0
21,L: Let's do a very quick Tone 101.,1746130.0,1748539.0
21,S: Tone 101.,1748540.0,1750518.0
21,So the idea is that different languages pay attention to different properties of,1750519.0,1755428.0
21,the way noises sound.,1755429.0,1757268.0
21,"So some languages in the world, when you change the pitch",1757269.0,1762199.0
21,"of your voice, it can signal a fundamentally different word meaning.",1762200.0,1768139.0
21,"So to give an example from Chinese, if",1768140.0,1770940.0
21,we say a syllable like /m/ - /a/ joined up together but with a,1770941.0,1775558.0
21,"different kind of pitch contour, it can mean something different.",1775559.0,1779529.0
21,So I'll give you a little example.,1779530.0,1780999.0
21,L: Okay.,1781000.0,1781999.0
21,"S: If I say 'mā,' it's a very common word that you would",1782000.0,1787889.0
21,use to refer to your mother.,1787890.0,1790288.0
21,L: Okay.,1790289.0,1791288.0
21,"S: If I say 'mǎ,'",1791289.0,1794079.0
21,it means 'horse.',1794080.0,1796158.0
21,So in this example what we can see is that the consonant and the,1796159.0,1799579.0
21,"vowel are the same for for those utterances, but the way the voice changes",1799580.0,1805168.0
21,in pitch signals a difference in word meaning.,1805169.0,1808139.0
21,And this is a bit different from languages like English.,1808140.0,1811048.0
21,L: Yep.,1811049.0,1812419.0
21,S: So what we know from decades of people trying to,1812420.0,1817798.0
21,teach Westerners how to speak Chinese is that people who don't speak languages with,1817799.0,1822389.0
21,tone have difficulty catching on to the pitch property of the words that they're,1822390.0,1829178.0
21,hearing and remembering it long enough to learn the meaning of it.,1829179.0,1831298.0
21,"L: I can never remember -- you know, there's only two,",1831299.0,1833939.0
21,"there's high and low in Syuba, and I never remember or really remember which",1833940.0,1839168.0
21,one it should be.,1839169.0,1840449.0
21,S: Yeah!,1840450.0,1841449.0
21,So there seems to be something fundamentally different,1841450.0,1843288.0
21,about the way that brains of English speakers process pitch compared to the,1843289.0,1848209.0
21,brains of Mandarin speakers who've grown up in a language that uses this property.,1848210.0,1852609.0
21,So what we wanted to know in some of our other studies is whether or not the,1852610.0,1858178.0
21,perceptual tuning to audio that has gone on for Mandarin speakers also changes,1858179.0,1864239.0
21,the cross-modal connection between hearing and vision.,1864240.0,1868459.0
21,L: Right.,1868460.0,1869559.0
21,S: So we've been running a bunch of studies with my,1869560.0,1872599.0
21,"former PhD student, Shang Nan, where what we've been doing is asking people who",1872600.0,1879279.0
21,speak different combinations of languages to make some judgements of the,1879280.0,1882459.0
21,"bouba/kiki kind, but listening to, instead of whole",1882460.0,1886619.0
21,"long words like maluma and takete, they're just listening to very short,",1886620.0,1891678.0
21,single-syllable names.,1891679.0,1893398.0
21,So they might be hearing /ī/ or /ǐ/ or /í/ or /ì/.,1893399.0,1900719.0
21,"L: And I'm not gonna lie, like, the first thing I think",1900720.0,1904609.0
21,of when I hear all four of those is /i/.,1904610.0,1909879.0
21,That's all I take away!,1909880.0,1911119.0
21,S: Right!,1911120.0,1912739.0
21,So then we also ask them the same questions,1912740.0,1915569.0
21,for the /u/ sounds.,1915570.0,1918168.0
21,So we had /ū/ and /ǔ/ and /ú/ and /ù/.,1918169.0,1924808.0
21,"L: And you'll be unsurprised to know that what I take away from that is /u/, like,",1924809.0,1931119.0
21,with any intonation.,1931120.0,1933388.0
21,"S: And we found this quite a lot, actually.",1933389.0,1937329.0
21,Our English-speaking participants struggle to really hear the difference,1937330.0,1941428.0
21,"between the different sounds, but, you know, they could always make a choice",1941429.0,1944798.0
21,depending on whether it was an /i/ sound or an /u/ sound.,1944799.0,1947629.0
21,L: Yeah.,1947630.0,1948629.0
21,"S: So we showed them a kiki-type shape and a bouba-type shape, and",1948630.0,1952768.0
21,had our people make their choices.,1952769.0,1954449.0
21,"And overall, everybody preferred the /i/",1954450.0,1959048.0
21,noises to go with the spiky ones and the /u/ noises to go with the blobby ones.,1959049.0,1963959.0
21,"L: Okay, so that still works.",1963960.0,1965819.0
21,S: But on top of that there was a tendency for the people who,1965820.0,1970139.0
21,"grew up in Mandarin Chinese to really, really like to match the high steady",1970140.0,1977569.0
21,tone like /ū/ with the blobby shape.,1977570.0,1982908.0
21,L: Okay.,1982909.0,1984129.0
21,S: Whereas our English speakers liked to match the high tone /ī/ with the spiky one.,1984130.0,1994038.0
21,L: Yep.,1994039.0,1995038.0
21,That gels with my personal feelings.,1995039.0,1998359.0
21,"S: So what we were finding, then, was that the English speakers were paying",1998360.0,2004129.0
21,"attention to the high frequency elements, the high pitch of the voice in /ī/ and",2004130.0,2011579.0
21,"saying, 'That's a spiky thing!'",2011580.0,2013619.0
21,Just like the staple is a high frequency noise and,2013620.0,2015939.0
21,just like the /k/ sound in 'kiki' is a high-frequency noise.,2015940.0,2020839.0
21,That all goes together to make a package that says high frequency should,2020840.0,2025018.0
21,be spiky.,2025019.0,2026629.0
21,Our Mandarin speakers were paying attention to pitch in a,2026630.0,2029079.0
21,completely different way.,2029080.0,2030499.0
21,They were paying attention to how much the pitch,2030500.0,2033369.0
21,changed.,2033370.0,2037259.0
21,"So when they hear sound like /ū/, it's nice and smooth and stable and",2037260.0,2044949.0
21,steady -- or at least this is what my PhD student who is a native speaker of,2044950.0,2048849.0
21,Mandarin Chinese tells me.,2048850.0,2050229.0
21,L: Right!,2050230.0,2051229.0
21,I trust her.,2051230.0,2052539.0
21,"S: Whereas when they heard a sound like /ù/, they were finding that a very dramatic",2052540.0,2058959.0
21,"sound because it becomes loud and then quiet very, very quickly, and the pitch",2058960.0,2063279.0
21,changes a lot.,2063280.0,2064279.0
21,So that was a very spiky sound for our Mandarin speakers.,2064280.0,2068519.0
21,So here what we see is this intriguing case,2068520.0,2072669.0
21,"where when we listen to just one feature of a sound, whether the pitch is high, or",2072670.0,2079029.0
21,"whether it's changing, or whether it's high, or whether it's low, two groups of",2079030.0,2083759.0
21,"speakers make exactly opposite decisions for which one should go with which, and",2083760.0,2087809.0
21,it seems to be driven by the way that their brain processes these sounds,2087810.0,2091789.0

22,so you're gonna beat me.,1428490.0,1430789.0
22,G: This is a word that you only ever use because you can,1430790.0,1435329.0
22,"have it, and I've only ever seen linguists use it to be like, 'What a great",1435330.0,1438829.0
22,word!',1438830.0,1439829.0
22,And I've never actually seen it in a context where someone wasn't,1439830.0,1442119.0
22,sign-posting how great a word it was?,1442120.0,1444139.0
22,So definitely don't think you have to know,1444140.0,1445759.0
22,"this word to be a linguist, but also a lot of linguistics really like this word.",1445760.0,1450099.0
22,And this word is 'anarthrous.',1450100.0,1451209.0
22,I think I'm pronouncing it right.,1451210.0,1453339.0
22,L: Anarthrous?,1453340.0,1454339.0
22,G: Anarthrous.,1454340.0,1455339.0
22,And this means 'not having a 'the.'',1455340.0,1457619.0
22,L: Mmm!,1457620.0,1458808.0
22,That's a really obscure word for saying 'this word doesn't have a 'the.'',1458809.0,1464109.0
22,G: It's such a complicated word for such a simple,1464110.0,1466819.0
22,concept.,1466820.0,1467819.0
22,"And so 'arthrous,' without the 'an-', would be 'having a 'the,'' and",1467820.0,1471599.0
22,'anarthrous' would be 'not having a 'the.'',1471600.0,1473939.0
22,L: Anarthrous also just sounds like a really great roller derby,1473940.0,1477049.0
22,name for a linguist nerd.,1477050.0,1478519.0
22,"G: Hi, my name is Ann!",1478520.0,1480558.0
22,Ann Arthrous.,1480559.0,1481558.0
22,"L: Yep, done.",1481559.0,1482558.0
22,"G: So a context where you might use this, and a context where I recently saw this",1482559.0,1486099.0
22,"word, was in Lynne Murphy's book, which we talked about in a recent episode, where",1486100.0,1488620.0
22,"she talks about how Americans will say, 'I'm in the hospital,' and Brits will say,",1488621.0,1493559.0
22,'I'm in hospital.',1493560.0,1494559.0
22,"And so for Brits, 'hospital' is anarthrous.",1494560.0,1498689.0
22,"And for Americans, 'hospital' is arthrous, as in,",1498690.0,1501819.0
22,you put a 'the' there.,1501820.0,1505839.0
22,"And you can do it with similar things, like, you go to",1505840.0,1507928.0
22,"school, you don't go to the school.",1507929.0,1510029.0
22,L: Yep.,1510030.0,1511029.0
22,"G: But you go to, like, the grocery store, which is the generic grocery store, even if",1511030.0,1513999.0
22,you mean a specific one.,1514000.0,1514999.0
22,L: That's a good word.,1515000.0,1515999.0
22,Try to use it in a sentence today.,1516000.0,1517808.0
22,G: Use it today!,1517809.0,1520089.0
22,No one will understand you.,1520090.0,1522199.0
22,And then you too will get to explain what it,1522200.0,1524049.0
22,means!,1524050.0,1525049.0
22,This is the thing that's always stopped me from getting any active use,1525050.0,1527749.0
22,"of the word, 'cause I know no one else would get it either.",1527750.0,1529949.0
22,"L: We'll post a link to that in the show notes, so you also know how to spell it.",1529950.0,1533969.0
22,G: Lynne's got this great point in her book where she talks about the 'in,1533970.0,1537339.0
22,"hospital' thing, and then she's like, 'It's anarthrous!'",1537340.0,1539419.0
22,"And then she puts in brackets, 'A word which I only use because",1539420.0,1542449.0
22,"it's so great, and here's what it means.'",1542450.0,1544159.0
22,"And I'm like, yeah, I see what you did there.",1544160.0,1546199.0
22,L: Pretty much.,1546200.0,1547199.0
22,G: I would have done the same thing.,1547200.0,1548199.0
22,L: So we mentioned briefly that even English can't agree on when you use,1548200.0,1552829.0
22,"articles and determiners and when you don't use them, and that varies even more",1552830.0,1558058.0
22,cross-linguistically.,1558059.0,1559058.0
22,"We saw with English and French, but I also like that",1559059.0,1561308.0
22,different languages have different resources to draw on.,1561309.0,1563799.0
22,And we talked about how determiners are this diverse group,1563800.0,1567558.0
22,of words that can kind of be invited to the same party and hang out together and,1567559.0,1572639.0
22,do a similar thing.,1572640.0,1574269.0
22,"And I think it's really interesting, if you've learnt a",1574270.0,1576089.0
22,"couple of languages, you might notice that some of the languages you speak",1576090.0,1579569.0
22,"have a distinct word that meets the function of 'a' or 'an,' but some languages",1579570.0,1584329.0
22,just co-opt their word for 'one' in doing that.,1584330.0,1587669.0
22,"G: Oh yeah, that's true!",1587670.0,1589549.0
22,L: Yeah.,1589550.0,1590549.0
22,"So, Syuba is a language like that, the Tibeto-Burman language of Nepal that",1590550.0,1594669.0
22,I work with.,1594670.0,1595819.0
22,"So if you want to refer to an indeterminate, just any",1595820.0,1598879.0
22,"particular one of a thing, you would say 'gùri tɕí,' 'one cat,' and that does the",1598880.0,1605639.0
22,same job as 'a' without having to invent a whole other word.,1605640.0,1609969.0
22,G: I think there are a bunch of European languages that do that,1609970.0,1612269.0
22,"too, because I know French and Spanish do, and",1612270.0,1614490.0
22,"German does, you have 'un chat,' or 'un gato,' or 'eine Katze.'",1614491.0,1620789.0
22,And those are all the same as the word for,1620790.0,1622299.0
22,'one' in those languages.,1622300.0,1623649.0
22,L: And there's a there's a really great WALS map -- we've,1623650.0,1626219.0
22,talked about the World Atlas of Linguistic Structures before -- that shows,1626220.0,1629609.0
22,where there are languages that have a distinct type determiner and languages,1629610.0,1634039.0
22,that use the numeral one for that function.,1634040.0,1637039.0
22,"G: Oh, that's very cool.",1637040.0,1638229.0
22,So we can click on this link and see a map of different,1638230.0,1642049.0
22,coloured dots where the word for 'a' is the same as the word for 'one' and where,1642050.0,1647049.0
22,it's different.,1647050.0,1648049.0
22,L: Yep!,1648050.0,1649049.0
22,G: That's really neat!,1649050.0,1650049.0
22,"L: And the definite equivalent, so the 'the' equivalent, is 'dì,'",1650050.0,1652689.0
22,and that's the same as the word for 'this.',1652690.0,1654549.0
22,"G: Oh, okay!",1654550.0,1655649.0
22,"L: So they don't have a separate 'the' and 'this,' they just have this one",1655650.0,1659769.0
22,"form, 'dì.'",1659770.0,1660769.0
22,"They have a distal, and they have a 'somewhere between far and near' as well,",1660770.0,1665409.0
22,super cool.,1665410.0,1666409.0
22,"And what's really cool is that for the 'the' equivalent, you say 'dì",1666410.0,1670808.0
22,"gùri,' or",1670809.0,1672349.0
22,"'the cat,' and in this case the determiner is before the noun, and with the number",1672350.0,1678169.0
22,"it was after, it was 'gùri tɕí' so that's 'cat one' as a kind of literal translation.",1678170.0,1683219.0
22,"And it's really, again, a nice reminder that determiners can have such different",1683220.0,1688139.0
22,functions and they can occur in different parts of the sentence in,1688140.0,1691569.0
22,"relation to the noun, but they still all have this same function.",1691570.0,1694869.0
22,"G: And there's a map of that, too, of which languages have",1694870.0,1697919.0
22,their word for 'this' and their word for 'the' as the same.,1697920.0,1701129.0
22,L: Yep.,1701130.0,1702129.0
22,"Thanks, WALS!",1702130.0,1703129.0
22,G: What I find is kind of the most interesting thing about determiners as a,1703130.0,1706879.0
22,category is the way that they kind of unify a bunch of things that we think of,1706880.0,1710969.0
22,as similar.,1710970.0,1712569.0
22,Latin actually has this thing that's very similar to what's,1712570.0,1716379.0
22,"in Syuba, which is their word for 'this,' which was 'ille, illa, illud' in Latin,",1716380.0,1722869.0
22,"became the Romance 'le, la, les' or 'el, los, las.'",1722870.0,1726939.0
22,L: Ahh!,1726940.0,1727939.0
22,"I was gonna say, they sound familiar.",1727940.0,1729889.0
22,G: Yeah!,1729890.0,1730969.0
22,And so the Latin word for 'this' became the word for 'the' in the,1730970.0,1735449.0
22,Romance languages.,1735450.0,1736449.0
22,L: Mmm!,1736450.0,1737449.0
22,G: So this is a thing that happens from language to,1737450.0,1739619.0
22,"language, even when they have no contact with each other, and they've never heard",1739620.0,1742059.0
22,"of each other, and they're nowhere near each other geographically.",1742060.0,1744259.0
22,This is just a trend that languages seem to have.,1744260.0,1746769.0
22,And the same thing for -- have you ever wondered why,1746770.0,1749928.0
22,"we have two forms, 'a' and 'an'?",1749929.0,1752548.0
22,L: Yes?,1752549.0,1753548.0
22,"But it's because -- I mean, I know the environments",1753549.0,1756819.0
22,"that they occur in, that 'an' occurs before something vowel-y or something H-y, but",1756820.0,1761579.0
22,that's a complicated historical complication.,1761580.0,1763509.0
22,G: Yeah.,1763510.0,1764509.0
22,"But 'an' is actually older than 'a,' right?",1764510.0,1766819.0
22,L: Ahh!,1766820.0,1767819.0
22,Yeah.,1767820.0,1768819.0
22,G: And the 'an' that's an 'an' is because it has the same,1768820.0,1771369.0
22,root as the word 'one' in English.,1771370.0,1773509.0
22,L: Mmmm!,1773510.0,1774649.0
22,"I have the Etymonline links, as I always",1774650.0,1778009.0
22,"love to do, for 'a' and 'the' that I'll put in",1778010.0,1780239.0
22,the show notes.,1780240.0,1781239.0
22,"G: So if you go to Etymonline and you look up the word 'one,' you",1781240.0,1784659.0
22,"can see that it's the same root as 'only,' or 'alone,' or 'atone,' which is like,",1784660.0,1789949.0
22,"'at one,' 'all one.'",1789950.0,1791229.0
22,L: Mmm!,1791230.0,1792229.0
22,"G: And in the dialect form 'good'un' or 'young'un,' that 'un' is a 'one' as well.",1792230.0,1798359.0
22,"But the 'one' pronunciation came up later, and 'an'",1798360.0,1801919.0
22,was also a version of that.,1801920.0,1803119.0
22,L: Yep.,1803120.0,1804119.0
22,"G: And so if you have 'own' and 'an,' you can hear how",1804120.0,1805789.0
22,"those are very similar to each other, and they're from the same root.",1805790.0,1808829.0
22,So English actually has that connection.,1808830.0,1811519.0
22,But the thing that makes me the most excited,1811520.0,1812769.0
22,about thinking about determiners as a group is that it helps explain a few,1812770.0,1816229.0
22,things about how we use determiners.,1816230.0,1818529.0
22,"So if you have a word like 'the,' you don't",1818530.0,1820899.0
22,just go around saying 'the' by itself in a sentence.,1820900.0,1823269.0
22,"Like, you can't say, 'I saw a cat, and then the kept going on,' or",1823270.0,1828409.0
22,something like that.,1828410.0,1830009.0
22,Because that does not work.,1830010.0,1831139.0
22,"L: You missed a word, Gretchen!",1831140.0,1832139.0
22,"G: It needs a noun there, for support.",1832140.0,1833899.0
22,"But other determiners like 'this' and 'that,' they can act by",1833900.0,1837679.0
22,themselves without support.,1837680.0,1838679.0
22,"So you can say, 'I saw this cat, and then this kept",1838680.0,1842019.0
22,going on.',1842020.0,1843019.0
22,"Maybe that's not particularly good sentence, but you know you can say,",1843020.0,1844939.0
22,"like, 'Give me this book and then I'll move this here,' or",1844940.0,1848729.0
22,something like that.,1848730.0,1849729.0
22,L: Yep.,1849730.0,1850729.0
22,"G: And so you can, you know, like the title of this episode,",1850730.0,1852799.0
22,"'this, that, and the other thing,' the 'this' and the 'that' in that sentence can each",1852800.0,1856039.0
22,refer to specific things without there being a noun there for support.,1856040.0,1860139.0
22,And what's interesting is that the pronoun,1860140.0,1863159.0
22,'they' in English comes into English from Old,1863160.0,1867139.0
22,"Norse, and it has the same origins as 'this' and 'that' and 'the.'",1867140.0,1872429.0
22,"They're all related to each other in terms of, like,",1872430.0,1875209.0
22,'that one' or 'those ones' or 'these ones.',1875210.0,1878769.0
22,All of those 'the' forms are related to each other.,1878770.0,1881709.0
22,So some theories of determiners group all pronouns together,1881710.0,1885489.0
22,"with determiners, because a determiner by itself -- at least the ones that can appear",1885490.0,1889839.0
22,"by themselves, like 'this' and 'that' and 'many' -- act a lot like pronouns as well.",1889840.0,1894649.0
22,And other languages also seem to have this,1894650.0,1897149.0
22,set of relationships between what some of the pronouns can be and what some of,1897150.0,1901819.0
22,what we think of as articles or something can be.,1901820.0,1903649.0
22,"And so if we group them into this category of determiners, it",1903650.0,1906339.0
22,actually explains why these seem to have these weird similarities,1906340.0,1910499.0
22,with each other.,1910500.0,1911499.0
22,L: It explains why everyone's at the same party!,1911500.0,1913179.0
22,G: Yeah!,1913180.0,1914179.0
22,"It's like seeing into the underpinnings, or the behind-the-scenes",1914180.0,1918569.0
22,"view of language and saying, actually, these things, if we think about",1918570.0,1922239.0
22,"them from a certain perspective, they do have a lot of weird similarities.",1922240.0,1925029.0
22,"L: So like with Syuba, we have 'dì' being both 'the,'",1925030.0,1929709.0
22,"which has to be part of a noun phrase for it to make sense as a 'the' equivalent,",1929710.0,1933789.0
22,but it also has its own full life as 'this' and can occur independently.,1933790.0,1939659.0
22,And so the thing I like about thinking about,1939660.0,1942239.0
22,"all of these things as determiners, rather than thinking about pronouns and",1942240.0,1946319.0
22,"articles and all of this, is that it makes a lot of sense as something that",1946320.0,1949999.0
22,would otherwise be really confusing and you'd be trying to give it a kind of,1950000.0,1953339.0
22,double identity that's unnecessary.,1953340.0,1955449.0
22,"G: Yeah, and it's weird to me that",1955450.0,1958619.0
22,'determiner' as a name for this particular category is actually around 100 years,1958620.0,1962789.0
22,old.,1962790.0,1963789.0
22,It's pretty well-established.,1963790.0,1964819.0
22,And it's weird for me that all,1964820.0,1966839.0
22,"through school, I never learned about determiners, I just learned about",1966840.0,1969959.0
22,"articles, and demonstratives, and pronouns, and possessive nouns, or possessive",1969960.0,1974939.0
22,"adjectives, or whatever they called all of these individual things.",1974940.0,1979009.0
22,And I didn't learn that there was a name for the,1979010.0,1981298.0
22,super category?,1981299.0,1982298.0
22,And you can talk about articles separately if you,1982299.0,1984230.0
22,"want to, but it wasn't until I started doing linguistics that I learned there",1984231.0,1987589.0
22,"was actually a name for this whole category, even though this is something",1987590.0,1990619.0
22,"that's not controversial among linguists, and it's something that's generally",1990620.0,1993979.0
22,"accepted and, you know, you walk into Ling 101 and they might start talking",1993980.0,1997409.0
22,about determiners.,1997410.0,1998459.0
22,And it's weird to me that this hasn't necessarily trickled,1998460.0,2000809.0

23,"But then, when you get this other sentence, you're like, 'Wait a second. It doesn't work.'",1831290.0,1835009.0
23,"So let's break down what's in that sentence again. So we have the sentence, 'Who do you",1835010.0,1838899.0
23,"want to read Ella Minnow Pea?' And the answer to that is, 'I want our listeners to read",1838900.0,1845889.0
23,"Ella Minnow Pea.' So there's something in the statement version of that, there's something",1845890.0,1849719.0
23,"in between the 'want' and the 'to,' and that's the 'our listeners.' Whereas, in 'I want to",1849720.0,1856099.0
23,"read Ella Minnow Pea,' there's nothing in between there. You might be able to say, 'I",1856100.0,1861359.0
23,"want me to read Ella Minnow Pea,' but that's not really an English sentence. So you could",1861360.0,1867639.0
23,"also ask the sentence as, 'You want who to read Ella Minnow Pea?' And again, there's",1867640.0,1873259.0
23,"the 'who.' L: Yes, I mean, it sounds weird. G:I mean, it relies on a certain pragmatic",1873260.0,1878449.0
23,context -- L: But I can answer it. G: It relies on a certain pragmatic context. You,1878450.0,1881319.0
23,"could say, 'You want who to read Ella Minnow Pea?' That's okay. L: Yeah, when I unveil",1881320.0,1886129.0
23,my plan for everybody to read it. G: You unveil your plan for world domination via literature.,1886130.0,1895209.0
23,So there's this sense that there is something that logically belongs in between the 'want',1895210.0,1901159.0
23,"and the 'to' in that second set of sentences and not in the first set, and that something",1901160.0,1905879.0
23,"could be 'listeners,' could be 'who,' could be 'you,' particularly Lauren, like, 'I want",1905880.0,1909890.0
23,"Lauren to read Ella Minnow Pea.' L: But there's nothing there, Gretchen. G: There's a sense",1909891.0,1914100.0
23,"that there's a word there, and yet clearly there's not a word there because the 'who'",1914101.0,1917629.0
23,"is actually at the beginning of the sentence. So there's nothing there, but that nothing,",1917630.0,1922799.0
23,"whatever that nothing is that's there, is preventing the 'want' and the 'to' from smooshing",1922800.0,1927499.0
23,into each other. L: Wow. G: It's really weird. L: This is most meaningfully nothing-y nothing,1927500.0,1933239.0
23,"that we've got. G: Right? And so, you can do this in all sorts of sentences. It generally",1933240.0,1937029.0
23,"requires a 'wanna,' but you can say something like, 'Who will I want to see?' 'Who will",1937030.0,1941759.0
23,I wanna see?' These are fine. 'Who will I want to go to the store?' 'Who will I wanna,1941760.0,1946469.0

23,"to the store?' It's just like, 'Wait, it crashed. What happened? What did you do to me?' And",1957690.0,1963439.0
23,"that's a piece of evidence, and some theories of linguistics call this piece of nothing",1963440.0,1967539.0

24,understand that you're not happy. Let's go to the city.' We went to the city. And there,379180.0,382699.0

24,"my father was really smart for doing that. G: He knew you very well. H: Yeah, I think",422360.0,426949.0
24,"so. So my goal was to get to college, and have wonderful conversations, and meet interesting",426950.0,431619.0
24,"people. G: Mm-hmm. H: I continued going to college. Then, in 1991, I came to the United",431620.0,440369.0

24,"I was very curious about how to represent the Chatino languages, but the only thing",461310.0,465729.0

24,"It was letter. I was writing emails around 2000, or something like that. It wasn't",518200.0,523489.0
24,"in 1991. So I began to write these letters in 2000. My sister, Emiliana, also was on",523490.0,530609.0
24,the same path. It was interesting because my sister Emiliana -- I would talk about,530610.0,535059.0
24,"all these things, and I said that I was the first one, but, quietly, she had the same",535060.0,540528.0
24,"idea. She was more proactive. Well, we were both working on our own ends. G: Oh, interesting.",540529.0,547289.0
24,H: Yeah. So Emiliana was in Oaxaca City then. She had a little coffee shop down there. And,547290.0,555619.0
24,"there walks in this American guy, whose name is Joel Sherzer. The professor Joel Sherzer,",555620.0,564969.0
24,he used to teach at the University of Texas in the anthropology department. Joel Sherzer,564970.0,569768.0

24,creating a program. Why don't you come and visit us -- G: Oh my god. H: -- at the University,597600.0,601708.0

24,"I was just like a labourer, someone who was so excited about this, you know? Because this",675310.0,679838.0

24,"me, 'Hey, we're going to go down there, and we're going to do fieldwork.' And I",684519.0,687498.0
24,"said, 'I'll come.' I pay my own way. I went there. Since Emiliana had placed this",687499.0,693329.0
24,"idea of me that I needed to study linguistics, then I asked Tony, 'Hey, do you think that",693330.0,699909.0
24,"I could join the Linguistics Department?' And then he says to me, 'Well, you're going",699910.0,703268.0
24,"to have to apply, but if you're ready to work hard, we might accept you.' G: Did you speak",703269.0,707099.0
24,"English at this point? H: Yes, I did. G: Oh, okay. H: So that's how I began to study linguistics.",707100.0,713679.0
24,"G: Oh, that's cool. So then you became a grad student at University of Texas. H: This is",713680.0,716628.0
24,"how I began a graduate [degree] in linguistics at the University of Texas in Austin. G: Oh,",716629.0,721258.0
24,cool. That's really neat. And then you wrote a dissertation about Chatino and learned a,721259.0,725638.0
24,"lot of stuff, including how to write it? H: Yeah. So one of the things that I wanted to",725639.0,730729.0
24,"do was to describe the poetics of Chatino where, at the time, I would call it poetics.",730730.0,735679.0
24,"One of the things that I grew up with, and what Joel Sherzer called verbal art, is what",735680.0,742289.0
24,he calls it. G: Speech... H: He wrote a book on speech play and verbal art. This is the,742290.0,746708.0
24,"title of a book that Sherzer wrote, but basically he used to call it verbal art. G: Verbal art.",746709.0,751579.0
24,"Oh, yeah. H: So what he meant by verbal art is just to take into account the different",751580.0,756669.0
24,types of speech styles that exist in one community. And one of the things that I saw in growing,756670.0,762489.0
24,up in San Juan Quiahije is that there are so many different types of discourse. We have,762490.0,769698.0
24,"ceremonial discourse. We have political discourse. We have dialogues, you know, exchanges. I",769699.0,777719.0
24,wanted to record some of those discourses because some of those -- so what gets transmitted,777720.0,783989.0
24,"in many of those discourses is the need to preserve tradition. For example, there's always",783990.0,791078.0
24,a pair of lines that the orator says. This is our tradition. This is what the elders,791079.0,796849.0
24,"left for us since the foundation of the community, since the foundation of the mountains, and",796850.0,801628.0
24,"to leave this tradition will be seen as bad. So as a Chatino speaker, every time I hear",801629.0,808739.0
24,"these ceremonial speeches, they resonate with me a lot. So I wanted to record us. The first",808740.0,814129.0
24,assignment that I had in the first moment when I was in graduate school was I proposed,814130.0,818869.0
24,"to record political speech. I went back to my community. I recorded political speech,",818870.0,825169.0
24,"and the change in the authority. I did my master's thesis on that. And then for my dissertation,",825170.0,830319.0
24,I did an ethnography of speech. I described the different patterns and structures -- G:,830320.0,837169.0
24,"Oh, like all the different genres? H: The different genres. And it was describing the",837170.0,842028.0
24,"ecosystem of the different styles -- G: Oh, that's interesting! H: -- of speech in",842029.0,845739.0
24,the community. And I worked with very gifted and talented speakers. This is something that,845740.0,851859.0
24,"I really wanted to do, and it was a lot of work, but it was, I think, very important",851860.0,860119.0
24,work. So I have the basis now to be able to continue that kind of work for other people,860120.0,865089.0
24,to do the same. G: Yeah. So we can we can link to your dissertation. But that's also,865090.0,869289.0
24,"how you got into, 'Oh my gosh, it's really hard to work with audio data.' H: That is",869290.0,872688.0
24,"right! Because it was hard for two reasons to be able to transcribe speech. I was, of",872689.0,878199.0
24,"course, a native speaker of the language so I knew what they were saying, but the problem",878200.0,882828.0
24,"was, when it was time to commit this language onto paper, that I was just a beginning writer.",882829.0,890628.0
24,"I mean, we were just in stages of developing the alphabet for the language, and then also",890629.0,895869.0
24,"learning linguistics. And then Anthony would worry. He is very meticulous at what he does,",895870.0,900569.0
24,"so he will say, 'Well, what is the alphabet that you want to use?' There were like two",900570.0,905438.0
24,"or three choices of alphabet, so if you're going to choose one, you're going to have",905439.0,908929.0
24,to be consistent. I was just beginning. G: That is so hard for a beginner too. H: It,908930.0,913639.0
24,was just -- it was tough. But another thing that I noticed was that it was just very time-consuming,913640.0,918688.0
24,to be able to be transcribing these texts. This is something that I began to realize,918689.0,923749.0
24,"when I began to transcribe this text. In my dissertation, I offer transcriptions of five",923750.0,930758.0
24,to six ceremonial texts. All of these are semi-long texts. G: You mean long speeches?,930759.0,934549.0
24,"H: Yeah, these are long speeches, and different genres. G: Yeah. Because I know when we're",934550.0,939248.0
24,"doing -- for the podcast, we make transcriptions for the podcast. We put the audio onto YouTube,",939249.0,944318.0
24,"actually, and we use YouTube's automatic speech recognition to create the first draft of the",944319.0,948758.0
24,transcript. And then we have a person who goes in and corrects it because there're,948759.0,952518.0
24,"all these corrections you need to make. For one thing, YouTube never recognises the name",952519.0,955318.0
24,"of the podcast, Lingthusiasm, because it's not a real word. H: Yeah. G: And so it gives",955319.0,959799.0
24,"us these crazy things about like 'link Suzy azzam.' Like, who is Suzy? Why is she here?",959800.0,966729.0
24,But we're lucky because we have automatic -- H: You're lucky! G: -- transcripts.,966730.0,970208.0
24,H: At least! At least you have -- this is news to me. This is the first time I heard,970209.0,974879.0

24,"paying a human to do hours of detailed work making the transcripts, even though we cut",978959.0,983758.0
24,out half of it by having an automatic thing create the first draft that that person can,983759.0,987948.0
24,"then fix. H: That is so interesting. I wish I had a tool like that for Chatino, you know?",987949.0,992979.0
24,At least something that could help me -- just to give me a little help so I won't get carpal,992980.0,998628.0
24,"tunnel. G: My gosh! Yeah, I bet. And it's probably hard for you to hire Chatino-speaking",998629.0,1002778.0
24,research assistants here in the US because I don't imagine there are a lot of them. H:,1002779.0,1006729.0
24,"Well, it's not only that, but since in Mexico, as part of the creation of the nation state,",1006730.0,1013058.0
24,"their policy has been to integrate indigenous people into this national language, which",1013059.0,1017879.0
24,"is Spanish. So then when students go to school, the language of instruction is Spanish. G:",1017880.0,1024958.0
24,Right. H: They don't know how to read and write in Chatino. G: So even if they're speaking,1024959.0,1029458.0
24,"Chatino, you have to teach them how to read and write first? H: Yes, that's right. If",1029459.0,1033239.0
24,"they can be of, you know, help. G: Yeah, absolutely. And that's part of what you're doing this",1033240.0,1038569.0
24,"weekend? H: That is right, yes. So then what happened, we continued to do research at the",1038570.0,1044619.0
24,"University of Texas, and we developed a very strong program of Chatino studies there. We",1044620.0,1050880.0
24,used to call ourselves the Chatino Gang. There have been like eight dissertations on different,1050881.0,1055919.0
24,Chatino languages that came out of the University of Texas from one or two very sporadic works,1055920.0,1061419.0
24,in Chatino. There were like eight very in-depth studies. And one of those works was by Lynn,1061420.0,1067599.0
24,Hou and Kate Mesh. They were studying sign language and gesture. Lynn Hou is a signer,1067600.0,1077149.0
24,"herself, and she will use transcribers in any spoken language, whether it's English,",1077150.0,1083429.0
24,"Spanish, or Chatino. G: Right. H: So she was doing her dissertation on language acquisition",1083430.0,1091209.0
24,"in socialization of deaf children in San Quiahije, in my community. She asked me to transcribe",1091210.0,1099709.0
24,the audio interviews that she was doing with the families. And these were really lengthy,1099710.0,1106459.0
24,"interviews. But then I took that very seriously because, like I said, I'm Lynn's ears, and",1106460.0,1116239.0
24,I have to do this transcription really faithfully so she can get access to this language. So,1116240.0,1122949.0
24,"in taking that work really seriously to allow her access, I began to do the transcription.",1122950.0,1130109.0
24,"But then, at that point, it became to me much more important to be able to have some tool",1130110.0,1135959.0
24,"that could help me because it was just a lot of work. So then I made a comment on Facebook,",1135960.0,1141049.0
24,"'Hey, you know what? I see that automatic speech recognition, it's just very developed",1141050.0,1147089.0
24,"in English and all of these languages, how can we get a tool to be able to transcribe",1147090.0,1152579.0
24,this text in Chatino?' I really don't care. I would love to just have a tool that,1152580.0,1157819.0
24,"says things in Chatino because they were repeating these things, 'cha, cha,' all the time,",1157820.0,1161819.0
24,"and it was just like, 'Oh my god. I just want to have something that could at least",1161820.0,1168619.0
24,"recognize a few words so that I don't have to type all of these words.' G: I mean,",1168620.0,1172849.0
24,because the estimates that I've seen for how long it takes to do a transcript are like,1172850.0,1176959.0
24,one hour of transcriber work for one minute of audio. H: Yes. G: And that's the kind of,1176960.0,1182069.0
24,"work -- so if someone has an hour of audio data, that's 60 hours of work to try to transcribe",1182070.0,1188719.0
24,"that one hour. H: That's right. No. G: Which is ridiculous! H: Yeah, it's very labourious.",1188720.0,1192589.0
24,"So then I began to ask people. In talking with some linguists, they will say, 'Well,",1192590.0,1201058.0
24,"it's very difficult to do speech recognition in small languages,' because the models",1201059.0,1208449.0
24,"such as forced alignment, which is a model that they had been using at the time, needed",1208450.0,1214989.0
24,"hundreds if not thousands of hours of text, and we did not have that. G: That's the",1214990.0,1221039.0
24,"whole point of it being a small language, you don't have those kinds of resources. H:",1221040.0,1225359.0
24,"Yes. So then I began to think, 'Well, how can we make it -- how can we speakers of",1225360.0,1231649.0
24,"minority languages make it, or facilitate, or invite these people who are doing this",1231650.0,1237809.0
24,automatic speech recognition research to be able to do collaborations and to help us create,1237810.0,1243019.0

24,"Damir Cavar and Gosia Cavar. It seems like they have some interest in doing ASR, and",1251570.0,1258389.0
24,"it seems like when I talked to them, and I told them about the problem, that they said,",1258390.0,1262609.0
24,"'Oh yes, I think that this could be possible.' It seems like it wasn't a challenge for them.",1262610.0,1267289.0
24,"They invited me to IU, Indiana University, and one of the interesting things that we",1267290.0,1271859.0
24,"did with Damir and Gosia there, which I did not encounter before, was that Damir thought",1271860.0,1279639.0
24,that we could entice people who were doing computational linguistics if we offer some,1279640.0,1283779.0
24,"data in open access. G: Okay. H: So then what I did there was that we had a little recording,",1283780.0,1290759.0
24,and then I re-spoke many of the texts that I had transcribed for my dissertation first.,1290760.0,1297089.0
24,"I re-read them. Then we put them again into ELAN, and then we put all their -- we annotated",1297090.0,1305999.0
24,"them with parts of speech, and cut and paste. G: So you re-spoke them like in an audio booth",1306000.0,1310909.0
24,"so you'd have higher sound quality? Or was it just slower? H: Well, we didn't have an",1310910.0,1316039.0

24,"where people can just download it, and they can use it to do any type of research that",1346410.0,1353149.0
24,"they want to. I thought that that was very clever and -- because Damir says, 'Well,",1353150.0,1359429.0
24,we need to allow people to have a nice corpus so that they can use it if they wish to add,1359430.0,1366949.0
24,a different language into their models.' G: And so do people start using it? H: This,1366950.0,1372100.0
24,is how I came into contact with the people that I'm working with right now. At some point,1372101.0,1378209.0
24,"-- also, Alexis Michaud, who works on a group of languages called Yongning Na, he was also",1378210.0,1389549.0
24,"asking the same question. He's a linguist, he's a phonetician, and he was working with",1389550.0,1396099.0
24,"these languages, and he also wanted to do some automatic speech recognition for the",1396100.0,1401559.0
24,languages that he was working with. G: Where are they spoken? H: In China. G: In China.,1401560.0,1405319.0
24,"Okay. H: Yes. The Na languages are spoken in China, so he also put some high-quality",1405320.0,1411469.0
24,"data out -- G: Out there on the internet, yeah. H: Yeah, out there in the internet.",1411470.0,1416599.0
24,"And that is how he got connected with Oliver Adams, who is one of the co-organizers for",1416600.0,1422399.0
24,this conference that I'm doing right now. So Oliver Adams got in touch with... G: Alexis,1422400.0,1429269.0
24,"H: With Alexis. So they began to do this collaboration, but then it came time when they wanted to",1429270.0,1437879.0
24,fit the model with another language that was also a tonal language. We had this corpus,1437880.0,1445769.0
24,"that we had developed with Linguist List, which was -- G: Chatino. H: -- Chatino with",1445770.0,1451799.0
24,"open access with one speaker, me -- G: Which is also a tonal language. H: Which is also",1451800.0,1456059.0
24,"a tonal language. G: It's completely unrelated to this language in China. H: Yeah, and actually",1456060.0,1460209.0
24,"it's spoken by a comparable size of population, like 40,000 people, kind of like that, 40-50,000",1460210.0,1466149.0
24,people. So that is how we began this collaboration. G: And so is the idea to make tools that could,1466150.0,1473519.0
24,work regardless of what the language is? Or you have to kind of -- so it'll work on Yongning,1473520.0,1478629.0
24,"Na, it'll work on Chatino, it'll work on some other language, it doesn't matter? Or is it",1478630.0,1483379.0
24,"to figure out how much data you need to train a very small amount of data, and then it works",1483380.0,1487639.0
24,"specifically on the language? H: Yes. Well, actually the methods that Oliver Adams is",1487640.0,1494739.0
24,"using is neural networks. G: Oh, okay. H: Yes. So he developed this software called",1494740.0,1503449.0
24,"Persephone. With Persephone, then, you can input data on -- I guess in this case he",1503450.0,1512519.0
24,"was interested in tonal languages, so maybe he developed some tools so that the model",1512520.0,1516900.0
24,"could recognize tonal languages. That's why he fed two tonal languages into the model,",1516901.0,1522809.0
24,to see what kind of outputs they had. It seems like with the corpus that Alexis was working,1522810.0,1531479.0
24,"with, the output was just excellent, because he used more data. But the output in Chatino",1531480.0,1539179.0
24,was also very good. It's very promising. G: So it's useful for you to take a first draft,1539180.0,1544409.0
24,of a transcript or something? H: I think that it'll be very useful. I have not used it,1544410.0,1549689.0
24,"to transcribe new data, and this is the reason why at the retreat we're going to find out",1549690.0,1555129.0
24,"how can we, who are not technologically savvy people, start using and training these models",1555130.0,1563179.0
24,with new data. G: So at the retreat the goal is to bring together the automatic speech,1563180.0,1569259.0
24,"recognition people and the minority language documentation people and say, 'Okay. How",1569260.0,1572980.0
24,can we help each other? How can we make these tools that'll work for everything?' H:,1572981.0,1575929.0
24,How can we collaborate? How can we make tools for language documentation? Yes. Because on,1575930.0,1580539.0
24,"the one hand, we linguists are not -- we don't know how to operate these models, and",1580540.0,1586199.0
24,"the engineers, they know how to work these systems. So the two of us are going to come",1586200.0,1591219.0
24,"together, and we're going to have an honest conversation. We linguists will say, 'How",1591220.0,1595029.0
24,would you like us to prepare our data so you can use it for your models?' They will tell,1595030.0,1598809.0
24,"us and vice versa, 'This is what we need.' G: And you have people working on multiple",1598810.0,1602509.0
24,"different languages, and multiple different technology-type things, all together? H: Yeah,",1602510.0,1607219.0
24,"that's right. In my conversations with Oliver Adams, right now our tools for major languages",1607220.0,1615849.0
24,"are very advanced. A lot of the problems have been solved. Actually, there are many sub-specialties",1615850.0,1621679.0
24,"within that field. For example, one of the interests that Oliver Adams has is multilingualism",1621680.0,1629079.0
24,"in ASR. So for him, this is so interesting because we're going to have different speakers.",1629080.0,1634459.0
24,"We're going to have speakers of Chatino languages, speakers of Mayan languages. Basically, what",1634460.0,1640729.0
24,Oliver Adam says is that many of the differences sometimes could even be anatomical. He should,1640730.0,1647209.0
24,"explain what he means more, but... G: So for multilingual automatic speech recognition,",1647210.0,1651189.0
24,is that an automatic speech recognition tool that works for multiple languages at the same,1651190.0,1655969.0
24,"time? H: Yeah, I think so. G: So if you're speaking in Chatino one minute and Spanish",1655970.0,1659649.0
24,"another minute, and let's say you also happen to speak a Mayan language, you could speak",1659650.0,1663249.0
24,"to it in any of those languages and it would be able to pick up, correctly, whatever you",1663250.0,1667229.0
24,"were doing? H: You know, I'm really new in this field, so I really cannot speak -- G:",1667230.0,1670959.0
24,"This is the hope, maybe. H: Yeah, yeah. I think we need to ask the ASR people these",1670960.0,1677559.0
24,particular questions. G: Yeah. But it would be great if it would work for multiple languages.,1677560.0,1680989.0
24,"That would be really cool. H: Yes, yes. Actually, this is the new frontier. G: Yeah, that's",1680990.0,1684829.0
24,"right. Because there's six, seven thousand languages in the world, and there's what,",1684830.0,1688829.0
24,maybe ten that you have really good automatic speech recognition tools for right now? H:,1688830.0,1692379.0
24,"That's right, yes. Yes. But the thing is that, still, for minority languages, there",1692380.0,1697569.0
24,"are certain requirements that need to be there in place first. Like with Chatino, it was",1697570.0,1703039.0
24,easy to do this because I have prepared the corpus. There is an alphabet we have for Chatino.,1703040.0,1708589.0
24,"So we have research in Chatino now, but many of those languages do not have this research",1708590.0,1715859.0
24,"available. So even if you have a sound file that is not transcribed in one language, it",1715860.0,1720559.0
24,"will not be useful for someone to -- G: Because you do need some training data. H: Yeah, you",1720560.0,1724619.0
24,"do need training data, and also, you need a person to evaluate the output of the model.",1724620.0,1729259.0
24,"G: Right. Because then you can't fix it if it's... H: That's right. For example, in",1729260.0,1732689.0
24,"the way we work with Oliver, it was that he put this data in, and then I as a person,",1732690.0,1738989.0
24,"as a speaker, I went out and just evaluated the output of the system. It has to be reciprocal.",1738990.0,1748189.0
24,"G: And so what's -- in 20 years when this is amazing and everything works great, what's",1748190.0,1756159.0
24,"the vision for how this works? Is it so people who speak Chatino can say, 'Okay, Google,'",1756160.0,1761339.0
24,"to their phones in Chatino and it will reply back? H: Well, I mean, people can give it",1761340.0,1768139.0
24,"many uses, right? I don't know if I can say what kind of uses people can give it if we",1768140.0,1774449.0
24,"were able to get to that point. But on a personal level, I would love to be able to have a tool",1774450.0,1779559.0
24,"that could help me transcribe text that I have. Because, actually, we have hundreds",1779560.0,1784059.0
24,"of hours of recordings of Chatino text, and it'll be wonderful to be able to have these",1784060.0,1790789.0
24,transcriptions. And the results of these transcriptions could be fed into ongoing dictionaries to,1790790.0,1799139.0
24,"study the syntax of the language, to study morphology, or all the different aspects of",1799140.0,1804169.0
24,the grammar. G: Or to make books or these kinds of things in the language. H: Or to,1804170.0,1807489.0
24,"make books in the language. For example, we have recorded many stories that -- they're",1807490.0,1811509.0
24,sitting there. We haven't been able to transcribe them. It would be nice if we had a nice transcription,1811510.0,1816479.0
24,"with the story, so then we can work with our artists and make children's books, and develop",1816480.0,1822279.0
24,"all of these materials to promote the language. G: Yeah. Because you've made some books already,",1822280.0,1825569.0
24,right? H: That is right! We just had some books published with the help of many people.,1825570.0,1833729.0
24,And I'm just so proud of this because this is one of the first times that I have seen,1833730.0,1838879.0
24,"children's books in Chatino. They are so beautiful, colorful. G: They're really beautiful. You",1838880.0,1842959.0
24,were showing them to me earlier and they're really lovely. H: This is a project that I,1842960.0,1847099.0
24,did with my students in our language revitalization class that I taught in the winter 2018 at,1847100.0,1853629.0
24,Dartmouth College. So one of the first things that we did was to do the drawings on cloth,1853630.0,1860509.0
24,"books. Each student developed their own theme, and they put it on cloth books. Then we had",1860510.0,1866239.0
24,"an exhibition, and then the exhibition was a success. It was really beautiful. People",1866240.0,1871499.0
24,"loved it. G: The cloth books look so cool! They're soft and you can -- you know, a baby",1871500.0,1876589.0
24,couldn't destroy them. H: That's right. And then I got some funding from the Neukom Foundation,1876590.0,1881139.0
24,to do the publication in a different format of these books. One of the students had to,1881140.0,1886649.0
24,draw pictures for many of the books because the originals were just images that students,1886650.0,1892239.0
24,"pulled out -- G: From the internet somewhere. H: -- from the internet somewhere, because",1892240.0,1896119.0
24,we were not thinking forward about publications and things like that. But when we realized,1896120.0,1901139.0
24,"that we needed to publish them, and that Neukom was offering some funding to publish them,",1901140.0,1906129.0
24,"we realized that we did not want to get -- G: You didn't want to get sued. H: Yeah, sued!",1906130.0,1912429.0
24,"So now we have these new books with completely new images, and they are -- G: And they're",1912430.0,1918579.0
24,"lovely. And they're Creative Commons, and they're Open License. H: That's right. G:",1918580.0,1921149.0
24,So you had a few of those books be translated into other languages that don't have enough,1921150.0,1925029.0
24,children's books? H: That's right. Because I had native speakers of North American languages,1925030.0,1931249.0
24,"in my class. I had my student who spoke Tlingit. There was another student who spoke Hupa,",1931250.0,1937769.0
24,"and Ojibwe. And when they saw this, they realized that they wanted to do the same version in",1937770.0,1941939.0
24,their own languages. G: That's so cool. H: It was just really amazing. So all of these,1941940.0,1945439.0
24,"books just came out. G: So now there's this little link between the Tlingit speakers,",1945440.0,1948849.0
24,"and the Hupa speakers, and the Ojibwe speakers, and the Chatino speakers. They'll all have",1948850.0,1952309.0
24,the same pictures in their books with the words in their own language. H: It is just,1952310.0,1955919.0
24,"so amazing, you know? I went back to Mexico, and I took the cloth books down to Oaxaca,",1955920.0,1963889.0
24,and there was this friend from my community who came to visit. I was visiting my mom in,1963890.0,1967879.0
24,"Oaxaca. He came to visit. And then I sat down with him, and I read him one of the children's",1967880.0,1973409.0
24,"books. And then at the end he says to me, 'It is so sad,' he says, 'that our language",1973410.0,1978749.0
24,"is getting lost.' That is -- so really, the books really bring these conversations",1978750.0,1984999.0
24,"about the importance of language. G: And if the kids are -- because, probably, a lot",1985000.0,1989569.0
24,"of the kids still kind of speak the language at home, but then when they go to school and",1989570.0,1992209.0
24,"the only language they see written down is Spanish, whereas if they could see also written",1992210.0,1996149.0
24,"versions of Chatino so they could be bilingual, and know that there's people who care about",1996150.0,2000809.0
24,"the language, and give it more prestige, and these kinds of things. H: That is right. I",2000810.0,2005299.0
24,grew up in Mexico hearing that indigenous languages were not languages because they,2005300.0,2010639.0
24,did not have a writing system. That is why I wanted to develop an alphabet to show that,2010640.0,2017369.0
24,"this is a legitimate language. By having these cute little books, it's -- G: And they look",2017370.0,2022479.0
24,"very professional, too. Like, they're shiny. And they look very professional. H: That's",2022480.0,2027069.0
24,right. Yeah. We wanted to make Chatino look good. So in this conversation that I had with,2027070.0,2034819.0
24,"this person from my community, I said to him, 'One of the worries that I have,' I said,",2034820.0,2041959.0
24,"'if I distribute this book in the community, is that many of the books that I see, like",2041960.0,2046639.0
24,"textbooks that the schools give for free, they all end up in the toilet.' So then I",2046640.0,2053178.0
24,"said, 'One of the worries that I have is that my book will end up in the toilet.'",2053179.0,2058209.0
24,"G: Yeah. H: He said to me very seriously, 'You know what? I'm going to tell you one",2058210.0,2059209.0
24,"thing.' He says, 'I read the Bible. I do not take the Bible in the toilet. The Bible",2059210.0,2070310.0
24,in my house has a special place. This book will be next to the Bible.' G: What a compliment!,2070311.0,2076298.0
24,"H: Yeah. G: That is so meaningful. H: It was just really beautiful, yes. G: Yeah. H: So",2076299.0,2080858.0
24,"I want to use these books to promote the language. One of the things that I would like to do,",2080859.0,2085558.0
24,"since this is a personal endeavor, and I don't have the backing of the state, I don't have",2085559.0,2091489.0
24,unlimited resources. G: Yeah. H: I would like to enlist families in the community to read,2091490.0,2100009.0
24,"the books, and then take videos of them interacting with the books and reading them with their",2100010.0,2104959.0
24,"children, take videos, and then, with their permission, upload them on social media, and",2104960.0,2109389.0
24,in this way promote reading. G: And they can see it. Because I think this is the thing,2109390.0,2112848.0
24,"is the technology space seems like it's so dominated by just a few languages, and to",2112849.0,2118149.0
24,"say, okay, this can be a language of technology, and this can be a language of writing and",2118150.0,2122739.0
24,of the future that you can keep passing on to your kids. H: That is right. Yeah. G: Yeah.,2122740.0,2127439.0
24,H: I sometimes put little videos saying little phrases in Chatino. There are a lot of Chatinos,2127440.0,2134069.0
24,"who have migrated to the States. And they have children, and some of them are teaching",2134070.0,2138589.0
24,Chatino to their children. Apparently I have some toddlers that follow my little videos.,2138590.0,2144129.0
24,"G: Oh my gosh! H: They just watch it over and over, and they repeat the words. G: Oh",2144130.0,2147858.0
24,"my god, you're like their teacher, or their grandma. H: Yes. But I wish I could do more.",2147859.0,2152889.0
24,It's just very sporadic. G: Yeah. But that's still so cool. So if you can get other people,2152890.0,2157149.0
24,"making videos as well, maybe that helps. H: Yes. Yeah, just make these books in different",2157150.0,2166518.0
24,"forms, like make little -- G: Or digital versions of them or something. H: -- animation,",2166519.0,2172368.0
24,"or things like that, yeah. G: Yeah, that's very cool. I've taken a photo of the books",2172369.0,2174608.0
24,"already. So we will share a photo of the books, and we'll also link to whatever website or",2174609.0,2177748.0
24,"something you have set up for those. People can go see them, and you can see what they",2177749.0,2181979.0
24,look like. H: And you know what? One of the most important things about this is that this,2181980.0,2186528.0
24,"-- as you say, these books have a Creative Commons License. So if someone out there would",2186529.0,2193788.0
24,"like to create children's books, they can use the same images, and just put their own",2193789.0,2199479.0
24,"text, and use the same things to publish their own books for their own language. G: Yeah,",2199480.0,2204759.0
24,that's really great. Hopefully you'll get photos being sent in from around the world,2204760.0,2208419.0

25,between isthmus and a peninsula now that I'm thinking about it. I'm sure someone does but,583990.0,587489.0
25,off the top of my head -- L: The difference is that I had heard of the word 'peninsula',587490.0,589809.0
25,"before I was 27. G: I mean, I grew up on a peninsula, but I don't know -- and there",589810.0,594909.0
25,"are, definitely, also some places called isthmuses -- isthmae? Isthmapodes? What is the plural",594910.0,599969.0
25,"of an isthmus? I can't even say this word anymore. It's too difficult. L: Yeah, trying",599970.0,603989.0
25,"to have the first reaction of it -- instead of being 'That's not a word,' trying to have",603990.0,608179.0
25,"the first reaction of, 'That is not a word I have encountered yet.' G: Yes, I haven't",608180.0,612639.0
25,heard of that. And how sad the world would be if I knew all the words already. Can you,612640.0,618258.0
25,"imagine not learning any new words? You'd never have that like, 'Whoa, what is that'",618259.0,623039.0
25,or 'I learned a new thing now.' Imagine a world where you've learned all the words.,623040.0,626388.0
25,That's a terrible world! L: Imagine a world where the vocabulary was so finite that you'd,626389.0,631198.0
25,"run out of new words and experiences to have. G: Oh, what a horrible word -- world. You",631199.0,635829.0
25,"know, I'm trying to think of examples of this, because I have definitely heard of words far",635830.0,639398.0
25,"too late and been like, 'Whoa, that's a real thing? Okay!' L: But also think of how quickly",639399.0,643849.0
25,your brain managed to absorb them and accept them. I now very happily accept that 'isthmus',643850.0,648749.0
25,is a real word and the isthmus of Oaxaca is a real place because my brain is capable of,648750.0,654469.0
25,accepting new words. G: And that blobfish are real animals apparently. I saw a graph,654470.0,659679.0
25,"once that said the average adult between the age of like, I don't know, and 55 or something,",659680.0,665078.0
25,learns one new word on average every day. It's like we're still learning new words all,665079.0,669309.0
25,the way through adulthood even though we think of learning new words as something you do,669310.0,672239.0
25,"when you're a kid, or when you're in school, or when you're acquiring a specific technical",672240.0,676088.0
25,"area, and yet we're picking up new words all the time. L: We're perfectly capable of it.",676089.0,680138.0
25,So the important lesson here is that we don't know all the words. G: Erin McKean has a really,680139.0,684768.0
25,nice quote about this from her TED talk about redefining the dictionary. She says when people,684769.0,690338.0
25,"think about a place and they don't find that place on a map, they think there's a problem",690339.0,693969.0
25,"with the map. But when they find a word that's not in the dictionary, they think this must",693970.0,697109.0
25,be a bad word. But it's more likely to be a bad dictionary. And I think that really,697110.0,701039.0
25,"sums it up. Okay, maybe a word is or isn't in a dictionary, but you've still found it",701040.0,705638.0
25,"in the dictionary, that is something that's just made by people, and they still have to",705639.0,708819.0
25,"acquire all the words themselves. L: That's funny how we go, 'I don't believe you that",708820.0,712528.0
25,"'blobfish' is a real word,' but it's not like I'm going to sit here and go, 'I don't",712529.0,716859.0
25,"believe you that Carlton isn't a real place.' G: Yeah, exactly! L: And I'm going to take",716860.0,721369.0
25,"you to Carlton when you're here because there's great ice cream. G: Okay, good. Yeah, like,",721370.0,725099.0
25,"'Oh, Lauren, I haven't been to Carlton. I didn't know there was --' actually, there's",725100.0,727799.0
25,"a Carlton in Canada as well, because the Brits and colonies and stuff. It's the name of a",727800.0,732809.0
25,"University in Ottawa. So I've been to that Carlton. I'm like, 'That's a real place.'",732810.0,736309.0
25,"But my Carlton is not the same as your Carlton. L: Well, that is probably true in this case.",736310.0,742469.0
25,G: I think there's kind of a subset of this category which is using an existing word in,742470.0,748289.0
25,a different sort of way. One of the things that I did for my very scientific research,748290.0,753248.0
25,of this episode was I looked for the quote 'isn't a real word' and 'not a real word',753249.0,758588.0
25,to see what kinds of words people were saying were to be a word. So this is how we came,758589.0,762708.0
25,up with these different categories as we took what people were saying about something not,762709.0,766318.0
25,being real words and we kind of broke them down into the different types of things people,766319.0,769619.0
25,do. And a couple that we came across people saying weren't real words were things like,769620.0,774289.0
25,"'learnings,' which is, I guess, used in teacher jargon to mean: the learnings; the learning",774290.0,780159.0

25,"blah. I haven't heard 'learnings' being used in that particular context, but I definitely",784850.0,789239.0

26,"palatalisation, because once you can spot palatalisation, you can find it everywhere.",1619279.0,1623238.0
26,It's in so many languages. I'd be honestly more surprised to find a language that had,1623239.0,1627058.0
26,never done any sort of palatalisation -- that hadn't done it -- than I would be surprised,1627059.0,1631028.0
26,"to find it in another language. Bantu languages, which are spoken in a wide swath of Africa,",1631029.0,1636248.0

26,with our cheeses of Europe. G: The same cheese-changes. I have a very vivid memory about when I first,1703299.0,1711758.0
26,learned about palatalisation. This was when I went to Scottish Gaelic summer camp when,1711759.0,1717858.0
26,I was 10 or 12? L: The thing is we don't have summer camps in Australia. So I find all summer,1717859.0,1722699.0
26,"camps mysterious. I'm like, 'Of course, you went on summer camp for Gaelic. Like,",1722700.0,1727218.0
26,that's that weird thing that North Americans do. They go on summer camp.' G: It is not,1727219.0,1731868.0
26,"very common to go on summer camp for Gaelic. Most of the other kids that were there, were",1731869.0,1737018.0
26,"there to learn, like, fiddle, or step dance, or something, which is still fairly rare.",1737019.0,1741439.0
26,"Most people go, like, canoeing or something. L: Okay. G: But I was a budding linguist,",1741440.0,1745928.0
26,"and I wanted to learn Gaelic. So when I was learning Gaelic, they told me about this distinction",1745929.0,1751028.0
26,between broad vowels and slender vowels. This is super important in Gaelic and in Irish,1751029.0,1756278.0
26,"as well, because a whole bunch of consonants in Gaelic change the way they're pronounced",1756279.0,1761819.0
26,depending on which vowels they're next to. L: Right. G: So you end up with all these,1761820.0,1765739.0
26,"silent vowels where the vowel itself is silent, but it's just being used to tell you how to",1765740.0,1770618.0
26,pronounce the consonant that it's next to. L: This is a bit like when I realised the,1770619.0,1774288.0
26,"reason you don't hear, in Spanish or in English -- the word 'guitar,' you don't hear",1774289.0,1779199.0
26,"that U -- is because Spanish uses U in the same way there, to indicate that it should",1779200.0,1783589.0
26,"be a /g/ and not a /ʒɪtɑɹ/. G: Exactly, it means the same U that's in, like, 'Guillaume'",1783590.0,1789359.0
26,"to indicate that that is a /g/ -- or in 'guerre,' 'guerrilla,' for 'war.' L: Yeah, it",1789360.0,1794949.0
26,"was a complete revelation for me when I was like, 'I'm not meant to -- the U is just",1794950.0,1798329.0
26,"there to help me, not to hinder me.' G: Yeah, it's to help you according to a completely",1798330.0,1801788.0
26,different system that you only understand incompletely. L: Yeah. G: This is the same,1801789.0,1805268.0
26,"thing for Gaelic. If you have a word, 'fáilte,' which is the word for 'welcome,' and the last",1805269.0,1811038.0
26,"two letters are T-E, the way you know that that T is pronounced like a /tʃ/ is because",1811039.0,1816858.0
26,"there's an E next to it. Or if you have names like 'Sean,' or 'Sinead,' or 'Siobhan,'",1816859.0,1823018.0
26,the way that you know that that S is pronounced like a /ʃ/ is because it has an E or an I,1823019.0,1828238.0
26,"next to it. L: Just, like, 'Come with me towards the palate.' G: This is the kind",1828239.0,1832319.0
26,"of thing that they teach you in Gaelic 101. They're like, 'Here's the broad vowels.",1832320.0,1835709.0
26,"Here's the slender vowels. Here's why they're so important,' because they tell you how",1835710.0,1838748.0
26,"to do this with all your consonants. And yet, afterwards, I was like, 'But English also",1838749.0,1842959.0
26,"kind of does this. Because if you have a word like 'circus,' the way that you know how",1842960.0,1848548.0
26,each of the C's is pronounced is based on the same distinction between what Gaelic traditionally,1848549.0,1853758.0
26,"calls 'broad' and 'slender' vowels, but we can call 'palatal' or 'non-palatal'",1853759.0,1858678.0
26,"vowels. The slender vowels in Gaelic are the same thing as a palatal vowel, or a front",1858679.0,1863758.0
26,vowel to use the proper linguistic term. All of those are the same class of things that,1863759.0,1868858.0
26,"all cause the same types of sound changes. The 'broad' vowels, or the 'non-palatal'",1868859.0,1873319.0
26,"vowels, or the 'back' vowels are all the same category of stuff that doesn't cause",1873320.0,1877928.0
26,the sound change. And that totally rocked my world when I figured it out the first time.,1877929.0,1882138.0

27,"L: Hm, new in terms of its current use?",1836010.0,1839308.0
27,"G: Yeah, so it comes from Old English. 'Sib' is actually related to the word for 'self.'",1839309.0,1844839.0

27,It'd be really great if we had a gender-neutral term for this umbrella category because inheritance,1859800.0,1865279.0
27,doesn't care.' And so they reached into Old English and pulled out this term that,1865280.0,1870428.0

27,G: That's fantastic. I like 'niblings' a lot.,1900230.0,1902639.0

28,the UK excellent how did you get into,56030.0,59119.0
28,linguistics ah reluctantly so I've,59120.0,65209.0
28,always loved languages loved learning,65210.0,68239.0
28,languages so I had friends who spoke,68240.0,69618.0
28,different languages at school and loved,69619.0,70999.0
28,learning you know odd word here or there,71000.0,72799.0
28,or phrases and things and at school,72800.0,76478.0
28,learnt a bit of German and Spanish and,76479.0,80269.0
28,then I went to university I went to,80270.0,83419.0
28,start so school or into Africa and,83420.0,85219.0
28,studies in London and I got there and I,85220.0,88368.0
28,was supposed to be studying law okay I,88369.0,90499.0
28,got there and I found that that you,90500.0,92148.0
28,could study I think the list was like 43,92149.0,94038.0
28,different languages from around the,94039.0,95689.0
28,world yeah and I was amazed and I,95690.0,98658.0
28,thought I can't be here and not studying,98659.0,100368.0
28,one of these languages so I changed my,100369.0,105349.0
28,life studies a little bit to study,105350.0,107328.0
28,Swahili in law so I had this list of,107329.0,109218.0
28,languages and for all which languages I,109219.0,110658.0
28,want to study and so I studied Swahili,110659.0,113179.0
28,law really thinking I'm interested in,113180.0,116179.0
28,languages learning languages but I'm not,116180.0,118129.0
28,interested in linguistics because I,118130.0,119839.0
28,didn't really know perhaps what,119840.0,121129.0
28,linguistics was it's one of my biggest,121130.0,122989.0
28,problems is that people don't actually,122990.0,124819.0
28,know what linguistics is so oh I like,124820.0,126828.0
28,learning languages and I like talking to,126829.0,128208.0
28,people but little English 16 not so sure,128209.0,130669.0
28,about that anyway the more I studied,130670.0,132499.0
28,Swahili in that case and the more I,132500.0,134149.0
28,learned about languages I did a,134150.0,135259.0
28,introduction to kind of linguistics,135260.0,137119.0
28,course and I thought okay this is,137120.0,138078.0
28,absolutely fantastic and then I moved to,138079.0,140268.0
28,linguistics I'm very happy to have you,140269.0,143479.0
28,I'm not gonna ask you any questions,143480.0,145789.0
28,about but for those who aren't familiar,145790.0,151189.0
28,with the Swahili language can you tell,151190.0,154518.0
28,us a bit about where it's generally,154519.0,156619.0
28,spoken and other fun fun swahili facts,156620.0,159828.0
28,absolutely absolutely so so healy is a,159829.0,161979.0
28,language spoken across East Africa so,161980.0,165378.0
28,the kind of homeland or traditional kind,165379.0,168348.0
28,of area where Swahili was spoken and was,168349.0,169999.0
28,long,170000.0,170379.0
28,the coast of present-day Tanzania and,170380.0,172629.0
28,Kenya and also onto some of the islands,172630.0,175689.0
28,so you might have heard of places like,175690.0,176769.0
28,Zanzibar so that's again on the off the,176770.0,178689.0
28,Tanzanian coast but so Healy is also no,178690.0,181269.0
28,one has been for long time used as a,181270.0,182979.0
28,lingua franca throughout East Africa so,182980.0,184719.0
28,they can't find it spoken in like Uganda,184720.0,187379.0
28,no parts of northern Mozambique and,187380.0,190419.0
28,southern Somalia Rwanda and Burundi so,190420.0,192519.0
28,it's got huge sort of geographic,192520.0,193719.0
28,coverage but that East Africa and we'll,193720.0,196269.0
28,make sure we link at least to the,196270.0,197769.0
28,Wikipedia article and a good map,197770.0,199269.0
28,absolutely yeah the domain oh yeah and,199270.0,201609.0
28,across the global diaspora as well but,201610.0,204129.0
28,that's it's interfere that's it's hot oh,204130.0,206699.0
28,so you studied that all the way through,206700.0,209049.0
28,your undergraduate yes and I spent a,209050.0,211479.0
28,year in East Africa so studying at a,211480.0,213699.0
28,university in terms of our own that,213700.0,215979.0
28,attended here so once an estrogen can,215980.0,217449.0
28,you run one semester in Tanzania just,217450.0,219039.0
28,focusing on so Hayley so that was where,219040.0,220719.0
28,I really sort of my eyes were open to,220720.0,223559.0
28,language and linguistics and just,223560.0,226149.0
28,thought yeah I want to do this for as,226150.0,228009.0
28,long as I possibly can so yeah once that,228010.0,230679.0
28,might just end up more more linguistics,230680.0,232479.0
28,course afterwards so you took more,232480.0,233829.0
28,linguistics after that and then you,233830.0,235119.0
28,ended up going into master's in,235120.0,237339.0
28,linguistics that's ours as well okay,237340.0,239349.0
28,yeah yeah and then a PhD in linguistics,239350.0,242019.0
28,also if you want absolutely and I think,242020.0,246819.0
28,yeah for me so I'm interested in that,246820.0,249579.0
28,language to mix Africa African languages,249580.0,251709.0
28,um SAS was a great place to do that,251710.0,255339.0
28,expertise was all around me and I think,255340.0,257829.0
28,because I studied law as an,257830.0,259208.0
28,undergraduate it actually felt like,259209.0,260858.0
28,quite a change because I just it was,260859.0,262539.0
28,completely different teachers it was,262540.0,263949.0
28,different Department um so it wasn't,263950.0,266529.0
28,like I'm still here by talking about the,266530.0,268809.0
28,PhD was a little bit like that but yes,268810.0,272319.0
28,oh it was it was a great place to do,272320.0,274029.0
28,that so I don't think it's as common in,274030.0,275919.0
28,North America but I did my undergrad and,275920.0,278579.0
28,postgraduate studies at the same,278580.0,280299.0
28,University you go there you go and if,280300.0,282459.0
28,you want to study Swahili law actually,282460.0,284139.0
28,so I stood the only place I know in the,284140.0,285519.0
28,UK that you can do it so much yeah not a,285520.0,289629.0
28,lot of places so there's obviously a bit,289630.0,293439.0
28,of a transition there from learning a,293440.0,296049.0
28,baby obviously got into linguistics cuz,296050.0,298179.0
28,you're interested in Swahili what was,298180.0,300609.0
28,the difference between learning Swahili,300610.0,303249.0
28,as a language,303250.0,304209.0
28,kleiner and studying like is your work,304210.0,308288.0
28,focused on Swahili or do you look at,308289.0,310329.0
28,other languages yeah it's a really it's,310330.0,313269.0
28,a really good question I suppose it was,313270.0,314409.0
28,quite a transition so the last few years,314410.0,316899.0
28,most of my work so my PhD was on a,316900.0,318758.0
28,different language not on so he leaves,318759.0,320138.0
28,on one language called Rangi okay,320139.0,322679.0
28,language spoken in Tanzania like then we,322680.0,325418.0
28,can talk more about that but that was,325419.0,328239.0
28,when I first Olivia came with more of a,328240.0,330818.0
28,linguistic approach because rather than,330819.0,333129.0
28,although I did learn a bit of the,333130.0,334929.0
28,language I was thinking of it as a you,334930.0,336698.0
28,know how do I learn about this and do,336699.0,339159.0
28,research and things I think it's about,339160.0,341529.0
28,perhaps building sort of like all those,341530.0,343269.0
28,shortcuts so if you're learning a,343270.0,344619.0
28,language you're just thinking of it,344620.0,345728.0
28,perhaps in isolation and what are these,345729.0,347978.0
28,words and how do I make a sentence yeah,347979.0,349569.0
28,and then with linguistics yes that,349570.0,350769.0
28,they're looking for shortcuts and common,350770.0,353288.0
28,patterns like oh I know what you know,353289.0,355508.0
28,grammatical gender is like oh I can now,355509.0,357309.0
28,you know work that across whatever,357310.0,359019.0
28,language you've got in front of me so,359020.0,360189.0
28,it's making those connections some of,360190.0,362408.0
28,which are language specific and that's,362409.0,363609.0
28,really interesting but I'm also,363610.0,365288.0
28,interested in then obviously as,365289.0,366549.0
28,linguists we're interested in what is,366550.0,368439.0
28,common across languages what you can do,368440.0,370569.0
28,what you can't do so maybe bigger,370570.0,372038.0
28,questions I always think of it as the,372039.0,374049.0
28,difference between learning to play,374050.0,375939.0
28,football and learning to be a good,375940.0,377948.0
28,football coach the difference between,377949.0,380079.0
28,you being able to kick the ball really,380080.0,382959.0
28,well and like I'm a terrible sports,382960.0,385448.0
28,player so like there's an analogy for me,385449.0,392679.0
28,because I'm very unrealistic about it,392680.0,394089.0
28,but you can invest a lot of effort in,394090.0,396459.0
28,learning yourself how to play the game,396460.0,398228.0
28,really well,398229.0,399038.0
28,but you can only ever really learn a,399039.0,400478.0
28,couple of codes of football right but if,400479.0,403089.0
28,you learn how to read a group of people,403090.0,405369.0
28,and how they move and what the rules are,405370.0,407109.0
28,there's more chance that you could,407110.0,409209.0
28,potentially kind of become really,409210.0,411309.0
28,observant about how ropey what and again,411310.0,413499.0
28,this is a terrible analogy because I'm,413500.0,414879.0
28,not being able but I feel like you,414880.0,419348.0
28,thought this is my go-to analogy so,419349.0,423399.0
28,moving from being a kind of player of,423400.0,425948.0
28,Swahili to figuring out the rules of the,425949.0,429129.0
28,Bantu language family so Swahili is part,429130.0,432278.0
28,of the band - yeah exactly so the bunty,432279.0,435429.0
28,language is a group of some things like,435430.0,437168.0
28,three,437169.0,437919.0
28,50 to 600 languages depending on how you,437920.0,441429.0
28,define a language away boundaries,441430.0,444519.0
28,good-sized family of languages yes so,444520.0,446799.0
28,about the size of indo-european my guess,446800.0,449469.0
28,which is the family English is in it's,449470.0,451809.0
28,about four or five hundred there you go,451810.0,453489.0
28,so it's a massive yeah language family,453490.0,455709.0
28,so that's sort of yeah group of,455710.0,457599.0
28,languages that are spoken I generally,457600.0,459759.0
28,just say in sub-saharan Africa but sort,459760.0,461709.0
28,of basically from Cameroon eastwards and,461710.0,464319.0
28,southwards with pockets of other,464320.0,465819.0
28,languages yeah,465820.0,466689.0
28,the aren't Bantu languages in those,466690.0,468129.0
28,regions as well but lots of sub-saharan,468130.0,470079.0
28,Africa just zoom out a little bit for,470080.0,473439.0
28,people who aren't familiar with the,473440.0,475709.0
28,incredible linguistic University of,475710.0,477759.0
28,Africa because I think you know in,477760.0,479739.0
28,Australia we kind of have between 150,479740.0,482289.0
28,and 300 languages depending on how you,482290.0,484209.0
28,count but they're all kind of either,484210.0,486069.0
28,part of one big palm and um family or,486070.0,488589.0
28,not and so we kind of we don't often end,488590.0,491049.0
28,you know all of Europe is pretty much,491050.0,492909.0
28,indo-european except for a few languages,492910.0,494949.0
28,it's hard to kind of comprehend just how,494950.0,496809.0
28,much diversity there is in the African,496810.0,499689.0
28,continent absolutely so I think um,499690.0,502059.0
28,estimates put the number of languages in,502060.0,504189.0
28,Africa somewhere around 2000 okay,504190.0,506259.0
28,so I don't know what your numbers for,506260.0,508389.0
28,the number of languages in the world are,508390.0,509889.0
28,but I think what do you say so some,509890.0,511749.0
28,people are closed seven yes so if you,511750.0,514179.0
28,take 2000 of those being in Africa,514180.0,515759.0
28,that's a massive proportion it's not,515760.0,519339.0
28,quite not quite a quarter but is a lot,519340.0,521579.0
28,and then so so you have something like,521580.0,523989.0
28,"2,000 or more languages in Africa those",523990.0,527019.0
28,are then broken down into four language,527020.0,529419.0
28,families and only so that's been the,529420.0,531909.0
28,tradition anyway so you have four sort,531910.0,533799.0
28,of language families and then the bunty,533800.0,535479.0
28,languages are part of one of those,535480.0,537129.0
28,language family said magic Congo group,537130.0,538839.0
28,but yeah even if you put the sort of,538840.0,540639.0
28,higher end of the numbers of bunting,540640.0,542409.0
28,language at 600 as you can see like all,542410.0,544239.0
28,"those 2,000 you still got lots of other",544240.0,546039.0
28,languages um so yeah really high levels,546040.0,549489.0
28,the linguistic diversity,549490.0,551109.0
28,quite high levels of bilingualism and,551110.0,553149.0
28,multilingualism across African continent,553150.0,555219.0
28,as well yeah and yeah I mean in Tanzania,555220.0,558849.0
28,where I do much of my research that's,558850.0,561459.0
28,like one country and it has 120,561460.0,563789.0
28,languages like recognized identified,563790.0,567299.0
28,languages so yeah it's like a lot of,567300.0,569409.0
28,linguistic diversity,569410.0,570999.0
28,and Rangi is also part of the ban -,571000.0,574389.0
28,absolutely yeah so Rangi is a bungee,574390.0,577509.0
28,language spoken in Central Tanzania and,577510.0,580599.0
28,I started working on Rangi because I'm,580600.0,582809.0
28,interested in amongst other things,582810.0,584949.0
28,language contact right so Rangi is a,584950.0,587139.0
28,boundary language it's spoken in this,587140.0,589089.0
28,area central Tanzania so basically the,589090.0,591519.0
28,bottom of the Rift Valley if people have,591520.0,594179.0
28,Bali yeah that sounds very what is the,594180.0,597489.0
28,Rift Valley oh gosh so this is a valley,597490.0,602139.0
28,that goes from I suppose that part oh,602140.0,603699.0
28,yeah Tanzania northwards that's how they,603700.0,607449.0
28,think of it and it's like physically a,607450.0,609339.0
28,rift so I supposed to do with tectonic,609340.0,612339.0
28,plates and things I'm definitely out of,612340.0,613719.0
28,my butt so Rangoon interesting because,613720.0,622709.0
28,but lots of reason but it is completely,622710.0,625719.0
28,surrounded by speakers of non bantu,625720.0,627819.0
28,languages okay so I was interested in,627820.0,630159.0
28,whether some of the grammar of regular,630160.0,632859.0
28,features that you'd find in rangi would,632860.0,634449.0
28,be the result of contact with non Bantu,634450.0,636489.0
28,languages right so we can talk more,636490.0,638559.0
28,about that but one of the things is,638560.0,639639.0
28,whether languages that are similar to,639640.0,641259.0
28,each other have different influences,641260.0,642879.0
28,when they're in contact than languages,642880.0,644859.0
28,that are very different so in the case,644860.0,647409.0
28,of ranky it's like you know Spanish,647410.0,649869.0
28,being in contact with Japanese or,649870.0,651759.0
28,something like it's really really,651760.0,652829.0
28,unrelated you know completely different,652830.0,655119.0
28,language families in like one geographic,655120.0,657729.0
28,area and what happens then one thing I'm,657730.0,660339.0
28,really interested with language contact,660340.0,661659.0
28,is sometimes it makes languages move,661660.0,663249.0
28,more similar because they're all hanging,663250.0,666009.0
28,out as like well I do this in this,666010.0,667689.0
28,language and it's handy so I'm gonna do,667690.0,669189.0
28,it in the other language to you and then,669190.0,671049.0
28,sometimes they kind of pull apart this,671050.0,673089.0
28,is like well I want to be different,673090.0,674499.0
28,sorry absolutely so I mean one of the,674500.0,676599.0
28,nice things about working on just to,676600.0,678549.0
28,step back working the bunty languages is,678550.0,680889.0
28,you have a large language family with,680890.0,683829.0
28,some really quite big broad similarities,683830.0,687279.0
28,I dunno typological similarities so,687280.0,689169.0
28,common things in lots of them but then,689170.0,691449.0
28,really small micro variations so you can,691450.0,693819.0
28,sort of say like oh well this is the,693820.0,695379.0
28,general word order but like look at this,695380.0,697389.0
28,tiny change between and I notice these,697390.0,700149.0
28,sides over here have to be different I,700150.0,701559.0
28,do I do different and so one things,701560.0,703299.0
28,that's interesting about,703300.0,704338.0
28,they're essential terms new air work is,704339.0,705869.0
28,you have the full language families that,705870.0,707878.0
28,I mentioned the beginning so that I've,707879.0,709498.0
28,found in Africa Tanzania is only place,709499.0,711328.0
28,where you find all four so I almost like,711329.0,713549.0
28,the meeting point of those really,713550.0,715409.0
28,different languages and so the question,715410.0,718049.0
28,there is if you're Rangi speaker and,718050.0,720599.0
28,you're surrounded by different types of,720600.0,722518.0
28,languages whether the language has,722519.0,724109.0
28,changed to reflect that and then the,724110.0,725849.0
28,sociolinguistic stuff so when you talk,725850.0,727198.0
28,about like the nature of contact there,727199.0,728909.0
28,are you know families where the people,728910.0,731308.0
28,speak different languages so you know,731309.0,732628.0
28,parents speak two different languages,732629.0,733888.0
28,their children perhaps speak one of them,733889.0,735568.0
28,or two of them and there's a sort of,735569.0,737549.0
28,long sustained history of what we would,737550.0,740099.0
28,call language contact so people moving,740100.0,741479.0
28,around trading with each other living,741480.0,743429.0
28,next door in the same village whatever,743430.0,746008.0
28,so like quite often slightly sort of in,746009.0,749128.0
28,balance power relations so they tend to,749129.0,751679.0
28,learn one of the languages but those,751680.0,753268.0
28,people don't also than the other ones so,753269.0,754768.0
28,you have some people who speak several,754769.0,756479.0
28,of those languages but not if you speak,756480.0,758518.0
28,the dominant language you don't then the,758519.0,759929.0
28,other ones as well and I guess it's kind,759930.0,762119.0
28,of worth stressing that like the,762120.0,764308.0
28,situation is incredibly interesting and,764309.0,766258.0
28,there's such diversity in Tanzania but,766259.0,768299.0
28,kind of sustained contact between very,768300.0,770878.0
28,diverse languages and long term small,770879.0,773909.0
28,community multilingualism is kind of,773910.0,776278.0
28,globally we see it again and again and,776279.0,778138.0
28,it's totally sustainable absolutely and,778139.0,780898.0
28,I think sometimes especially if you're,780899.0,783628.0
28,all kind of an English speaker who grew,783629.0,785248.0
28,up in the UK or Australia you're so used,785249.0,787678.0
28,to this kind of stable monolingualism,787679.0,789719.0
28,with a few people speaking their own,789720.0,791188.0
28,languages at home um it's really worth,791189.0,794188.0
28,stressing that we're the weird ones yeah,794189.0,796528.0
28,absolutely and like you know you talk,796529.0,797909.0
28,about the linguistic diversity of Africa,797910.0,799378.0
28,but like yeah I mean around the world,799379.0,801268.0
28,yeah people speak different languages,801269.0,803099.0
28,they shift to other languages when they,803100.0,804688.0
28,move if they need words like you know,804689.0,806578.0
28,there's all sorts of really just,806579.0,807448.0
28,practical considerations you move to a,807449.0,809729.0
28,new area you need to talk to people and,809730.0,811498.0
28,feed yourself and you know those kind of,811499.0,813178.0
28,things so yeah yeah and you work across,813179.0,815128.0
28,all the grammar or are you interested in,815129.0,817528.0
28,particular chromatic or phenomena ah,817529.0,820948.0
28,that's an excellent question so for the,820949.0,823138.0
28,research that I did on Rangi for my PhD,823139.0,825808.0
28,there was a couple of descriptions,825809.0,828958.0
28,before so other people have done well,828959.0,830969.0
28,one woman had done a PhD but two people,830970.0,832739.0
28,done PhDs before but I essentially did,832740.0,835169.0
28,also a description which meant I had to,835170.0,837088.0
28,know a little bit about everything,837089.0,838119.0
28,as I went in not knowing anything but,838120.0,841179.0
28,the particular I was looking at,841180.0,843369.0
28,particular feature which is what led me,843370.0,844719.0
28,to think it was something to do with,844720.0,845769.0
28,language contact which is a particular,845770.0,847059.0
28,word order which was unusual in Rangoon,847060.0,849099.0
28,I think there is a construction in which,849100.0,852429.0
28,you find the verb before the auxilary,852430.0,854349.0
28,okay and it is a language which has the,854350.0,857709.0
28,same kind of word order is English so,857710.0,858939.0
28,the subjects and the verb and the object,858940.0,860789.0
28,so like the Bantu languages in general,860790.0,862899.0
28,you would expect to say you know I eat,862900.0,865689.0
28,apples I think I'm just hungry or in,865690.0,876129.0
28,less violence there you go exactly so,876130.0,878319.0
28,you know I eat apples or for example I,878320.0,880869.0
28,will eat apples and essentially in Rangi,880870.0,883659.0
28,if you're ever talking about things in,883660.0,885278.0
28,the futures of the future tense you say,885279.0,888039.0
28,to eat I will and that is,888040.0,891449.0
28,cross-linguistically very unusual but,891450.0,893559.0
28,most the kind of prediction is if you,893560.0,895299.0
28,have a language with subject the object,895300.0,897759.0
28,order so I eat apples or I will eat,897760.0,900459.0
28,apples and know that you always expect,900460.0,902559.0
28,that will to come before eat say in,902560.0,904689.0
28,English but also across linguistically,904690.0,906039.0
28,it's a very strong generalization very,906040.0,907899.0
28,strong pattern based on prediction that,907900.0,909669.0
28,you will find that order and in Rangi,909670.0,911319.0
28,it's the other way around but only in,911320.0,913028.0
28,the future tense right so that was my,913029.0,915249.0
28,starting point and because it was in,915250.0,916599.0
28,contact with languages with different,916600.0,917739.0
28,word or there's really different,917740.0,918939.0
28,structures I thought oh well this is,918940.0,920799.0
28,obviously something to do with language,920800.0,921849.0
28,contact and how interesting and I had to,921850.0,924429.0
28,do lots of the descriptive work and,924430.0,925958.0
28,documentation work to start with but,925959.0,927999.0
28,that was what I started looking at I,928000.0,929349.0
28,think in the PhD I didn't really end up,929350.0,931479.0
28,talking about that because I really got,931480.0,934059.0
28,very excited about this little burr,934060.0,935799.0
28,border and the context in which you,935800.0,937419.0
28,could have it couldn't have it go to,937420.0,940419.0
28,linguistics you would definitely not,940420.0,941919.0
28,reluctant when you say I spent four,941920.0,944829.0
28,years getting really excited about,944830.0,946208.0
28,auxilary order when your life and,946209.0,948609.0
28,several years later I'm still excited,948610.0,950199.0
28,about opportunities got the cut Nutella,950200.0,951639.0
28,excellent so that was sort of my focus,951640.0,954489.0
28,and then actually I found so we thought,954490.0,956528.0
28,Rangi was one of the very few Bantu,956529.0,958719.0
28,languages that have this order and then,958720.0,960699.0
28,I found another language that's spoken,960700.0,961778.0
28,about 60 kilometers away so to talk,961779.0,963729.0
28,about kind of high levels of linguistic,963730.0,965409.0
28,diversity in a small area that also has,965410.0,967299.0
28,that order and I've since found four,967300.0,969309.0
28,languages which have spoken up nine near,969310.0,970899.0
28,Lake Victoria so that's now,970900.0,972009.0
28,much further away but if you say of that,972010.0,974739.0
28,there are even if you put sort of,974740.0,976509.0
28,estimate at the low end so 350 bounty,976510.0,978789.0
28,languages there seem to be six that,978790.0,980619.0
28,allow BER books in every order I mean so,980620.0,983349.0
28,I'm still interested why why those,983350.0,985629.0
28,languages and what's different about,985630.0,987039.0
28,them and it still may be that this kind,987040.0,988599.0
28,of contact angle plays a role in that so,988600.0,991029.0
28,if you if you speak two languages and,991030.0,993219.0
28,they have different word orders and,993220.0,994299.0
28,different word orders then that doesn't,994300.0,996789.0
28,seem so strange to you to say to each I,996790.0,999699.0
28,will write it just because your party,999700.0,1001829.0
28,for this language or the other languages,1001830.0,1003059.0
28,you speak allow that and then it becomes,1003060.0,1004709.0
28,a natural part of standard sort of waves,1004710.0,1006599.0
28,but yeah so nepali tried kind of used,1006600.0,1009299.0
28,that they stay in Nepal and the Tibetan,1009300.0,1011579.0
28,languages that I work with those,1011580.0,1013049.0
28,languages have subject object though so,1013050.0,1015659.0
28,I apples ate and now what I had learned,1015660.0,1018629.0
28,a new language even if it's a subject,1018630.0,1021269.0
28,verb object like English I like no,1021270.0,1023579.0
28,that's weird my like my brain is very,1023580.0,1026219.0
28,comfortable with what order that I,1026220.0,1027958.0
28,really struggling with Michael is now,1027959.0,1029789.0
28,your final it's great it's the best,1029790.0,1033078.0
28,absolutely so you know imagine that over,1033079.0,1035219.0
28,generations or you know your whole,1035220.0,1036689.0
28,community also speaking all those other,1036690.0,1038729.0
28,English and the other languages you,1038730.0,1040078.0
28,learned along the way like yeah awesome,1040079.0,1042239.0
28,like the only thing I know about bantery,1042240.0,1045179.0
28,languages and it's from the fact so we,1045180.0,1048299.0
28,worked it so us at the same time or we,1048300.0,1050039.0
28,know each other one thing that I know,1050040.0,1053819.0
28,about bantery languages is that they do,1053820.0,1056009.0
28,cool stuff with nouns yes and I love,1056010.0,1058679.0
28,nouns so can we can we talk about please,1058680.0,1061439.0
28,yes please so they do lots of cool,1061440.0,1064529.0
28,things renowned but the most striking,1064530.0,1066749.0
28,thing I suppose and the thing that I,1066750.0,1068159.0
28,always give us an example when people,1068160.0,1070259.0
28,say that oh what's unusual or what's the,1070260.0,1072059.0
28,kind of striking thing about the bunting,1072060.0,1073589.0
28,language is about so Healy is that they,1073590.0,1076049.0
28,have a system of what have water -,1076050.0,1078119.0
28,traditionally in English it's been,1078120.0,1079649.0
28,called noun classes okay so they are,1079650.0,1081719.0
28,like grammatical gender so if you're,1081720.0,1083999.0
28,familiar with French with masculine,1084000.0,1085619.0
28,feminine or German masculine feminine,1085620.0,1087509.0
28,neuter yep you have two genders three,1087510.0,1090779.0
28,genders and Swahili for example has 16,1090780.0,1093059.0
28,okay that is like I'm not good at math,1093060.0,1096119.0
28,it's slightly more than three yes yeah,1096120.0,1099299.0
28,so so you have actually the gender,1099300.0,1102239.0
28,system doesn't make any text base,1102240.0,1103679.0
28,distinction so there's no sort of like,1103680.0,1104939.0
28,you,1104940.0,1105808.0
28,man and woman or boy and girl like,1105809.0,1107998.0
28,grammatically and so the nouns are,1107999.0,1110788.0
28,categorized in other ways okay so one of,1110789.0,1114298.0
28,the like really sort of prominent,1114299.0,1115408.0
28,features across the grammar of banty,1115409.0,1117089.0
28,languages actually is a distinction,1117090.0,1118228.0
28,between things that are alive and that,1118229.0,1119819.0
28,are not alive so animate and inanimate,1119820.0,1122038.0
28,or sometimes more specifically human and,1122039.0,1125038.0
28,not human so let me just use the,1125039.0,1126959.0
28,terminology like now classes and then,1126960.0,1128638.0
28,they tend to be numbered because you,1128639.0,1130048.0
28,can't get away with masculine and,1130049.0,1131158.0
28,feminine once you get up to and in fact,1131159.0,1132959.0
28,luganda so panty language back in Uganda,1132960.0,1135418.0
28,has I think 21 now in class okay,1135419.0,1137518.0
28,when you get down to that you just like,1137519.0,1138689.0
28,well let's just number them we can't you,1138690.0,1140908.0
28,know masculine feminine neuter you sort,1140909.0,1142918.0
28,of run out so you is find for example,1142919.0,1144988.0
28,plus 1 would be humans yeah but very,1144989.0,1150088.0
28,human exactly we think with the most,1150089.0,1152368.0
28,important so like humans are like person,1152369.0,1154468.0
28,you know the word person the word for,1154469.0,1155968.0
28,teacher there weren't a child yeah and,1155969.0,1157768.0
28,then what's conventionally then numbers,1157769.0,1159868.0
28,plus 2 is the plural of that ok so,1159869.0,1162508.0
28,teacher and then teachers child children,1162509.0,1165588.0
28,farmer farmers so you can almost have to,1165589.0,1168778.0
28,start we think that well actually I can,1168779.0,1170128.0
28,cut those in half because most things,1170129.0,1171508.0
28,then the lower numbers have singular and,1171509.0,1173728.0
28,plural counterparts that's probably true,1173729.0,1176548.0
28,up until about plus 10 because after,1176549.0,1178319.0
28,that you end up with things that don't,1178320.0,1179338.0
28,make a singular plural distinction but,1179339.0,1181079.0
28,to start with so for example on the,1181080.0,1183748.0
28,basis so he Li you have yet humans class,1183749.0,1186689.0
28,three and four are things like I did a,1186690.0,1188338.0
28,mountain river moon so maybe kind of,1188339.0,1191218.0
28,natural phenomenon like a tree plant,1191219.0,1193768.0
28,things like that if you're learning this,1193769.0,1195508.0
28,language these are the things you learn,1195509.0,1196798.0
28,to the black okay well those have broad,1196799.0,1198028.0
28,categories,1198029.0,1198628.0
28,and then of course you find something,1198629.0,1199888.0
28,that doesn't seem to you at least to,1199889.0,1201748.0
28,make ya any sensitive in that category,1201749.0,1203788.0
28,I mean people often talk about this with,1203789.0,1205738.0
28,the kind of French German gendered based,1205739.0,1208048.0
28,stuff they're like you know well why are,1208049.0,1210268.0
28,these inanimate objects arbitrarily,1210269.0,1212478.0
28,gendered and why is like they like the,1212479.0,1215848.0
28,uterus as masculine and French is my my,1215849.0,1220468.0
28,randoms could go to example fact of,1220469.0,1222778.0
28,light you know these things are mostly,1222779.0,1225268.0
28,semantically coherent but actually,1225269.0,1227758.0
28,language is a is a phone system not,1227759.0,1230788.0
28,favorite kind of does all kinds of like,1230789.0,1232498.0
28,he have yeah so so those are like quite,1232499.0,1235079.0
28,systematic so you could to think about,1235080.0,1236428.0
28,natural phenomena or whatever and then,1236429.0,1239308.0
28,next ones are things that often go in,1239309.0,1241138.0
28,pairs or part-whole relations or like,1241139.0,1243808.0
28,fruits and trees and things like that,1243809.0,1245219.0
28,actually but then you get to things that,1245220.0,1247138.0
28,are what we would say like follow,1247139.0,1248729.0
28,logically determined so they have a,1248730.0,1250048.0
28,particular sound okay so one class is,1250049.0,1252178.0
28,things that begin with kit and then,1252179.0,1253709.0
28,exploring this V but again those things,1253710.0,1262469.0
28,will definitely a most commonly,1262470.0,1264989.0
28,inanimate because you're human and,1264990.0,1266878.0
28,animal things are going to be in a,1266879.0,1267808.0
28,different place so things that begin,1267809.0,1269969.0
28,with K and V nuns that begin with,1269970.0,1272729.0
28,needles so yeah and yeah and yeah go in,1272730.0,1277168.0
28,another class thing well so you and then,1277169.0,1279118.0
28,you end up with a class which doesn't,1279119.0,1280678.0
28,have a singular plural distinction but,1280679.0,1281969.0
28,like abstract nouns so happiness love,1281970.0,1284038.0
28,freedom yet things like that and then,1284039.0,1286349.0
28,another I think really nice to the,1286350.0,1288178.0
28,Future twenty languages many of them,1288179.0,1289618.0
28,have different noun classes for,1289619.0,1291388.0
28,locations so you have a general location,1291389.0,1293959.0
28,often a specific location and an,1293960.0,1296398.0
28,internal location and those are also,1296399.0,1298199.0
28,different non classes like different,1298200.0,1300689.0
28,grammatical genders okay like that,1300690.0,1302998.0
28,mm-hmm,1302999.0,1303839.0
28,so that's like the nouns but then if you,1303840.0,1305729.0
28,think about how a language works that,1305730.0,1307739.0
28,then spreads across everything so my,1307740.0,1310109.0
28,book you know the word for my is going,1310110.0,1313048.0
28,to be affected by which class book is in,1313049.0,1316048.0
28,so in this case book is one of the kick,1316049.0,1318268.0
28,yeah examples so excellent it's my,1318269.0,1320849.0
28,favorite it's guitar boo and then so you,1320850.0,1323998.0
28,say Changu so guitar butch angled book,1323999.0,1326699.0
28,my literally sin my book whereas if,1326700.0,1329219.0
28,you're talking about your teacher,1329220.0,1330918.0
28,teachers human animal so it's Molly moon,1330919.0,1334079.0
28,and then it's mangle so not just the,1334080.0,1337319.0
28,mound change it has a different prefix,1337320.0,1339808.0
28,but then the thing that agrees the,1339809.0,1343168.0
28,possessive the my also changes and so it,1343169.0,1346739.0
28,would be the same four numbers so,1346740.0,1348329.0
28,counting any adjectives big small,1348330.0,1350689.0
28,possession of so and on verbs and what,1350690.0,1355408.0
28,for a new honor to get there absolutely,1355409.0,1357209.0
28,are the kids do it absolutely absolutely,1357210.0,1359609.0
28,absolutely and you can also use it in,1359610.0,1361829.0
28,fun instead of you know the sort of,1361830.0,1364918.0
28,layers so you can put things in,1364919.0,1366508.0
28,different non classes for pejorative,1366509.0,1368819.0
28,meaning like change meanings and things,1368820.0,1371949.0
28,I think you'd like this example so the,1371950.0,1373989.0
28,word for bird is in dengue so if you,1373990.0,1377139.0
28,think about is alive so you have you,1377140.0,1378789.0
28,make the agreement the appropriate,1378790.0,1380499.0
28,agreement for +1 let's say something,1380500.0,1382869.0
28,that's alive but an aeroplane is also,1382870.0,1385179.0
28,the same word and decade but it's not,1385180.0,1386859.0
28,alive right so it's agreement with being,1386860.0,1388869.0
28,class 9 because it's not alive so it's,1388870.0,1390429.0
28,the same word so you can sort of move,1390430.0,1392079.0
28,things around and so I guess this is how,1392080.0,1394839.0
28,you can create new words,1394840.0,1397239.0
28,so like when aeroplanes were invented,1397240.0,1399669.0
28,instead of doing what we did and kind of,1399670.0,1402189.0
28,cobbling together some existing english,1402190.0,1404199.0
28,and french and whatever you can take an,1404200.0,1407499.0
28,existing white and put in another noun,1407500.0,1409119.0
28,absolutely so you know you can shift,1409120.0,1411039.0
28,things into different classes they can,1411040.0,1412329.0
28,then mean different things I have sort,1412330.0,1414069.0
28,of subtle different social meanings and,1414070.0,1416439.0
28,you can cobble together you know two,1416440.0,1418419.0
28,words and make a new a new word for,1418420.0,1420699.0
28,something no telescopes I think,1420700.0,1422409.0
28,something that seems far away or or,1422410.0,1424149.0
28,things like telescope but yeah,1424150.0,1425709.0
28,absolutely you have a difference of set,1425710.0,1427179.0
28,of things at your disposal fabulous and,1427180.0,1429849.0
28,so you were talking about the noun,1429850.0,1431109.0
28,clauses force what here yeah and then,1431110.0,1433989.0
28,are they similar across all the,1433990.0,1436479.0
28,languages so that's that's really,1436480.0,1441759.0
28,interesting question so people have sort,1441760.0,1444369.0
28,of made a distinction between Bantu,1444370.0,1446169.0
28,languages which have what would be,1446170.0,1448119.0
28,described as a canonical noun class,1448120.0,1449949.0
28,system which means that they usually,1449950.0,1451209.0
28,have six noun classes or upwards so to,1451210.0,1453879.0
28,helium let's say it has 16 in Luganda at,1453880.0,1455619.0
28,the higher level has 21 and you tend to,1455620.0,1457779.0
28,find similar patterns so animate things,1457780.0,1460119.0
28,you know sometimes a specific class for,1460120.0,1462129.0
28,humans tools objects long things you,1462130.0,1467289.0
28,know trees things that are sort of yeah,1467290.0,1469089.0
28,not human but a natural phenomena alive,1469090.0,1471399.0
28,whatever but then at the other end of,1471400.0,1473079.0
28,the spectrum you end up with languages,1473080.0,1474399.0
28,often in the northwest of the punty area,1474400.0,1476979.0
28,so sort of around Cameroon Kabam with,1476980.0,1480639.0
28,really what we would think of as reduced,1480640.0,1483039.0
28,system of noun classes so sometimes many,1483040.0,1486879.0
28,lessons six maybe you know a handful and,1486880.0,1489729.0
28,the reason that people would describe,1489730.0,1491079.0
28,those is reduced is that the idea is,1491080.0,1492759.0
28,that historically the Bantu languages so,1492760.0,1495729.0
28,like the sort of predecessor of Bantu,1495730.0,1497529.0
28,languages or the you know what they all,1497530.0,1499299.0
28,came from did have this high number of,1499300.0,1501639.0
28,noun classes so that was sort of one of,1501640.0,1503439.0
28,the unifying features in Bantu language,1503440.0,1505379.0
28,and so the ones that are in Cameroon and,1505380.0,1507419.0
28,out that area which is where the bunting,1507420.0,1508829.0
28,language is supposed to have originated,1508830.0,1510389.0
28,then those systems have Native eroded,1510390.0,1513509.0
28,over time and pull noise so you would,1513510.0,1514949.0
28,describe that as like a reduced system,1514950.0,1516599.0
28,not in any sensitive but at some point,1516600.0,1522209.0
28,they had more and they've lost them and,1522210.0,1523889.0
28,you can sort of see you know why you may,1523890.0,1526319.0
28,lose them but interestingly even,1526320.0,1527669.0
28,languages that have lost them that,1527670.0,1528959.0
28,animate and inanimate distinction is,1528960.0,1530729.0
28,often one of the ones that remain okay,1530730.0,1532259.0
28,so it's really important whether,1532260.0,1533999.0
28,something is human or if it's a chair,1534000.0,1535519.0
28,and languages do this with all kind like,1535520.0,1538379.0
28,we see this all the time with different,1538380.0,1539699.0
28,parts of the grammar that languages will,1539700.0,1542339.0
28,have something in this very elaborate,1542340.0,1543839.0
28,system and then it will fall away like,1543840.0,1545699.0
28,English used to have this you know,1545700.0,1547499.0
28,agenda case marking the way that German,1547500.0,1549989.0
28,goes and we don't have it anymore,1549990.0,1552389.0
28,because the language changed and we,1552390.0,1554909.0
28,moved away from that so this kind of,1554910.0,1557249.0
28,cycle of things reducing or growing or,1557250.0,1560219.0
28,whatever is is a completely normal part,1560220.0,1563369.0
28,of absolute absolutely and it and it,1563370.0,1565589.0
28,makes it fun to kind of see how,1565590.0,1567149.0
28,languages change in different contexts,1567150.0,1569639.0
28,yeah so I mean one of the things that's,1569640.0,1572069.0
28,nice about working on this is the bunchy,1572070.0,1573959.0
28,language family is that lots of there so,1573960.0,1575609.0
28,there are written a set of descriptions,1575610.0,1577919.0
28,of some of these languages from I don't,1577920.0,1579749.0
28,know over 100 years ago or things but,1579750.0,1581519.0
28,there's often not long written records,1581520.0,1584159.0
28,so you don't find examples of writing,1584160.0,1586669.0
28,with the exception actually of so Healy,1586670.0,1588839.0
28,and then maybe you can't go and a few,1588840.0,1591779.0
28,other languages but we can basically,1591780.0,1593399.0
28,trace a lot of the history of movements,1593400.0,1596249.0
28,of various people in these parts of,1596250.0,1598019.0
28,Africa through looking at the languages,1598020.0,1599729.0
28,so you can see what languages are sort,1599730.0,1601769.0
28,of similar in terms of similar,1601770.0,1603119.0
28,vocabulary and words and then,1603120.0,1605299.0
28,reconstruct where these people may have,1605300.0,1607649.0
28,moved from and what time they moved and,1607650.0,1609629.0
28,things like that so that's like language,1609630.0,1611099.0
28,really can help us piece together parts,1611100.0,1613259.0
28,of history that we may otherwise yeah,1613260.0,1615089.0
28,they can be a part of the story,1615090.0,1616199.0
28,basically yeah so Rangi is a smaller,1616200.0,1619109.0
28,language um but Swahili is one of the,1619110.0,1623339.0
28,largest languages in Africa yeah so I,1623340.0,1625649.0
28,think in terms of people say it's one of,1625650.0,1627899.0
28,the most widely spoken languages because,1627900.0,1631049.0
28,of it having this massive sort of,1631050.0,1632459.0
28,geographic coverage across the East and,1632460.0,1634259.0
28,Africa um I think a speaker number,1634260.0,1637489.0
28,really best of us,1637490.0,1639359.0
28,I've heard up to like 120 million I,1639360.0,1641789.0
28,can't result massive but it's not in the,1641790.0,1644099.0
28,way that I like you know I speak Italian,1644100.0,1647249.0
28,in that I can navigate an Italian menu,1647250.0,1649829.0
28,is that because it's a lingua franca,1649830.0,1652109.0
28,that kind of quality not not to kind of,1652110.0,1654359.0
28,label feeling like that so I mean I,1654360.0,1656789.0
28,think probably I don't really know but,1656790.0,1659369.0
28,you know let's say so did like 60 or,1659370.0,1660779.0
28,nineteen million or something like I,1660780.0,1662129.0
28,think actually lots of those people are,1662130.0,1663929.0
28,really very competent speakers who use,1663930.0,1666539.0
28,it regularly for important purposes in,1666540.0,1669119.0
28,their life yeah um Tanzania,1669120.0,1672449.0
28,interestingly was the only country in,1672450.0,1674539.0
28,Africa that declared an African language,1674540.0,1677219.0
28,it's official language of Independence,1677220.0,1678779.0
28,okay so rather than the former colonial,1678780.0,1680579.0
28,language so Tanzania like primary,1680580.0,1684419.0
28,education is in Swahili Parliament,1684420.0,1686759.0
28,speaks in Swahili a radio station things,1686760.0,1688889.0
28,have sweetly but then when you get to,1688890.0,1690389.0
28,those other countries the sort of,1690390.0,1691799.0
28,official status of Swahili perhaps would,1691800.0,1694109.0
28,be slightly different always different,1694110.0,1696089.0
28,um but I think that there are languages,1696090.0,1699089.0
28,which have in like across the African,1699090.0,1700979.0
28,continent which have much higher numbers,1700980.0,1702839.0
28,of speakers because for example Nigeria,1702840.0,1705419.0
28,for example is so sort of yeah populous,1705420.0,1707759.0
28,awesome those sort of West African areas,1707760.0,1709769.0
28,so yeah that you have higher numbers of,1709770.0,1711809.0
28,speakers so people usually say that so,1711810.0,1713279.0
28,he leads the most like widespread I,1713280.0,1715139.0
28,can't you can have a widespread spoken,1715140.0,1717209.0
28,language that's positive like you know,1717210.0,1719039.0
28,that's positive exactly exactly there,1719040.0,1722639.0
28,are so there are people being educated,1722640.0,1724079.0
28,in Swahili and using it for business,1724080.0,1726959.0
28,are there many Swahili speaking,1726960.0,1729349.0
28,linguists in Tanzania or other countries,1729350.0,1732329.0
28,yeah absolutely so there's a there's a,1732330.0,1734999.0
28,sort of not a divide but there are yeah,1735000.0,1739319.0
28,there are people studying so Healey as a,1739320.0,1742259.0
28,subject and linguists working on so,1742260.0,1744749.0
28,Hylian other let's say the main,1744750.0,1747389.0
28,colleagues I have our in East Africa so,1747390.0,1749399.0
28,other East African languages so imagine,1749400.0,1751799.0
28,lots of work with people at the,1751800.0,1752939.0
28,University of Dar es Salaam they have a,1752940.0,1754259.0
28,Department of linguistics foreign,1754260.0,1756089.0
28,languages and linguistics and then also,1756090.0,1757859.0
28,in Zanzibar in also in Kenya so there,1757860.0,1761009.0
28,are universities where people are doing,1761010.0,1763199.0
28,research on so here we um and there's,1763200.0,1765479.0
28,linguistic journals written you know in,1765480.0,1768059.0
28,to any publishers really and then the,1768060.0,1770279.0
28,other sort of big cohort of people would,1770280.0,1772619.0
28,be,1772620.0,1773039.0
28,people in America or Europe who are,1773040.0,1775949.0
28,learning really yeah I mean in America,1775950.0,1777959.0
28,quite a lot of them are also of African,1777960.0,1780449.0
28,origin so they're from Africa and may,1780450.0,1782189.0
28,have grown up speaking Swahili okay and,1782190.0,1783869.0
28,then have gone to American universities,1783870.0,1785669.0
28,to teach so healy or do research and,1785670.0,1787349.0
28,things like that yeah but as a whole,1787350.0,1789439.0
28,there is a sort of ongoing range of,1789440.0,1792829.0
28,challenges that people are facing so,1792830.0,1794939.0
28,lots of colleagues in African,1794940.0,1796169.0
28,universities of East Africa have real,1796170.0,1798839.0
28,you know shortage of sort of funding so,1798840.0,1801119.0
28,access to funding for external,1801120.0,1802379.0
28,conferences to travel to do research,1802380.0,1804709.0
28,yeah,1804710.0,1805919.0
28,really high numbers of students so again,1805920.0,1808829.0
28,universities which is great to see so,1808830.0,1810509.0
28,many students interested in these topics,1810510.0,1812089.0
28,and wanting to sort of like look at,1812090.0,1814619.0
28,languages and stuff but obviously yeah,1814620.0,1817649.0
28,with in some cases like resource you,1817650.0,1820979.0
28,know sort of limited resources yeah and,1820980.0,1823079.0
28,then the other thing that you sort of,1823080.0,1824399.0
28,find is that in many cases people are,1824400.0,1827399.0
28,rather than studying you know Swahili,1827400.0,1829679.0
28,perhaps all panting languages like from,1829680.0,1831929.0
28,a linguistic perspective yeah people are,1831930.0,1834389.0
28,interested perhaps more in the practical,1834390.0,1836279.0
28,applications so like if you're in,1836280.0,1837989.0
28,Tanzania and there are 120 languages and,1837990.0,1840649.0
28,yes primary education is in so healy,1840650.0,1843179.0
28,most of those children when they arrive,1843180.0,1845429.0
28,at school don't speak so Healey like,1845430.0,1847379.0
28,what what can we do about that you know,1847380.0,1849089.0
28,what are the sort of practical,1849090.0,1849869.0
28,implications of that how can we make,1849870.0,1851549.0
28,transitions more you know smooth how can,1851550.0,1854099.0
28,we ensure that people who have or have,1854100.0,1856199.0
28,not been to school have access to,1856200.0,1858319.0
28,services and information and things like,1858320.0,1860849.0
28,that so and more sort of perhaps sort of,1860850.0,1863839.0
28,linguistics and language relating to,1863840.0,1866399.0
28,education relating to sort of access to,1866400.0,1868109.0
28,resources and stuff like that whereas I,1868110.0,1869999.0
28,think some of the more perhaps like,1870000.0,1871769.0
28,theoretical linguistics and looking at,1871770.0,1873509.0
28,that for its own sake is people are,1873510.0,1875489.0
28,doing laughs as well but there's a sort,1875490.0,1876659.0
28,of constant tension between well you,1876660.0,1878489.0
28,know we also have these issues that are,1878490.0,1879989.0
28,right in front of our face and the,1879990.0,1881549.0
28,government wants us to solve them and,1881550.0,1882719.0
28,they say well you're a linguist at the,1882720.0,1883889.0
28,University um you can solve this or do,1883890.0,1886379.0
28,this and so that's something that you,1886380.0,1888059.0
28,see quite a lot as well in the,1888060.0,1890069.0
28,department side yeah being super,1890070.0,1891779.0
28,interested in noun classes is my great,1891780.0,1894629.0
28,but it's such a privilege and yeah,1894630.0,1897959.0
28,absolutely much more pressing,1897960.0,1899609.0
28,I imagine people feel that there's much,1899610.0,1901409.0
28,more pressing things that need to be,1901410.0,1902759.0
28,done absolutely and I suppose the there,1902760.0,1905069.0
28,are it's great there's more,1905070.0,1906539.0
28,positive student - also thinking that oh,1906540.0,1908099.0
28,well I speak a language that is not,1908100.0,1909299.0
28,written down that there's no descriptive,1909300.0,1911939.0
28,grammar on that no one's written an,1911940.0,1913289.0
28,article on like I can contribute to that,1913290.0,1915089.0
28,and so there are like increasingly yeah,1915090.0,1917369.0
28,youngest as a linguist coming through,1917370.0,1919019.0
28,and doing that and seeing that that is,1919020.0,1920639.0
28,really important as well and that's,1920640.0,1921959.0
28,important for identity and,1921960.0,1923999.0
28,self-determination and things like that,1924000.0,1926459.0
28,but at the same time yeah as actually,1926460.0,1929969.0
28,all of us deal with you know well if you,1929970.0,1931589.0
28,want to get a job like you know how are,1931590.0,1933089.0
28,you going to ya know navigate you're,1933090.0,1935039.0
28,interested in that into employment or,1935040.0,1937589.0
28,sort of stability or the kind of,1937590.0,1939839.0
28,opportunities that you know face you so,1939840.0,1942979.0
28,yeah I I've been really lucky to be able,1942980.0,1945779.0
28,to work with yeah fantastic colleagues,1945780.0,1947519.0
28,most of my researchers in Tanzania so,1947520.0,1949679.0
28,those are the ones I have the strongest,1949680.0,1951239.0
28,links with but going to conferences is,1951240.0,1953279.0
28,always a great opportunity to meet with,1953280.0,1954599.0
28,people from across the continent or,1954600.0,1956369.0
28,based at universities in other countries,1956370.0,1958169.0
28,and things like that so yeah awesome if,1958170.0,1961439.0
28,you could leave people knowing one thing,1961440.0,1963419.0
28,about linguistics what would it be,1963420.0,1966079.0
28,it's awesome don't be like me and think,1966080.0,1970199.0
28,that languages are the only thing that's,1970200.0,1971579.0
28,interesting that that also linguistics,1971580.0,1973499.0
28,is interesting you can you know that's,1973500.0,1975209.0
28,also something we can can study um ah,1975210.0,1977639.0
28,yes being monolingual is not the norm in,1977640.0,1981179.0
28,the world right it's true yeah yeah,1981180.0,1984329.0
28,that's how much it's about linguistics,1984330.0,1986369.0
28,but yeah I think we can as you were,1986370.0,1987959.0
28,saying anyone like think that it's,1987960.0,1989639.0
28,normal just to speak their language and,1989640.0,1991019.0
28,actually globally yeah oh yeah and I,1991020.0,1994769.0
28,think you know there are linguistics,1994770.0,1996629.0

29,then it,189440.0,190439.0
29,"would be like 'Put in an adverb,' 'Put in an adjective,' like 'I ran down slowly",190440.0,194519.0

29,"with verbs, which",289800.0,291248.0

29,"L: Okay, yeah, that could work. G: Okay, so, if a verb is like the coat rack",343009.0,348528.0

29,"L: Yeah, that works. G: I'm into this. Can you put a word in",358300.0,361598.0
29,a place where it's supporting a lot of different other parts of the sentence and does that,361599.0,366869.0
29,"sound normal, or does that sound like it's an innovation? If you take a word like 'internet,'",366870.0,371579.0
29,"for example, and you say, 'I'm gonna internet right now' or 'I've got a lot of",371580.0,377709.0
29,"internetting to do,' or 'Let's just internet that and see what the answer is,'",377710.0,382668.0
29,that's using 'internet' like a verb. You have this feeling that that's a novel,382669.0,388308.0
29,thing to,388309.0,389308.0
29,do or it's a relatively new thing to do. And the canonical use of 'internet' is,389309.0,392368.0
29,more like 'What's on the internet right now' or --,392369.0,395049.0
29,"L: 'The internet is messy,' which is, like, a very noun thing.",395050.0,399029.0
29,"G: 'The internet is a weird place.' You know, that's a very 'noun' use of 'internet.'",399030.0,403489.0
29,You could use it as a verb. You can use anything as a verb,403490.0,406698.0
29,if you try hard enough. But the question of 'Is it a verb?' is often 'Is it a pre-established,406699.0,412638.0
29,verb that lots of people use it as a verb or is this a new thing that,412639.0,416558.0
29,you're doing to it that's verbing it?' L: Yeah.,416559.0,418538.0
29,"G: You can verb 'verb,' but the word 'verb' is canonically a noun.",418539.0,423338.0
29,L: People get really upset when you talk about verbing stuff.,423339.0,426718.0
29,"G: Yeah, there's this Calvin and Hobbes quote, 'Verbing weirds language,' which",426719.0,430778.0
29,"of course is using 'weird' as a verb. And, again, you can make any",430779.0,434408.0
29,word into a verb if you try hard enough. But some words are already pre-packaged as verbs,434409.0,439708.0
29,and some you have to put a little bit of effort in.,439709.0,441769.0
29,"L: And when you used 'blorp,' you said, 'I'm blorping right now,' which is like",441770.0,447198.0
29,"-- 'I'm blorping.' So there's one hook for 'I'm.' Whereas I said,",447199.0,451918.0
29,'I'm blorping out of the treehouse.' So I've got -- 'I'm' is one hook,451919.0,456408.0
29,"and 'out of the treehouse' is another. So we've used the same -- well, we've",456409.0,461609.0
29,possibly used,461610.0,462609.0
29,different made-up verbs because we don't really know what 'blorp' means yet. We're,462610.0,465718.0
29,"doing this all backwards. G: Well, yeah, more often you start with the",465719.0,469599.0
29,"meaning. Or if I say, 'I'm blorping you' or 'I blorped that to you,' then I've",469600.0,475158.0
29,"got two hooks, 'I'",475159.0,477359.0
29,"and 'you,' or three hooks 'I'm blorping that to you.' We still don't know what",477360.0,482408.0
29,"'blorping' is, but we know that it can support these -- you know, if it's our",482409.0,487349.0
29,"coat rack,",487350.0,488349.0
29,it can support the hooks that contain 'I' and 'you' and 'that.',488350.0,491609.0
29,"L: We've already talked a little bit in Episode 9 about constituency, which is this",491610.0,496549.0
29,idea that language isn't just a random throwing-together of,496550.0,501258.0
29,"words. It's not just a bucket of balls. It's actually got this structure, and if",501259.0,506248.0
29,"you have one word, it comes with these other words. Verbs are a really great example of",506249.0,510908.0
29,constituency and how just one verb can bring all these other things to the sentence.,510909.0,515889.0
29,"G: Yeah, it can bring them, or it can support them if they're already there. It's creating",515890.0,520978.0
29,this thing that things are mentioned around. I think,520979.0,524179.0
29,"one of my formative experiences with verbs, after Mad Libs, was when I was studying Latin",524180.0,530659.0
29,in high school. One of the things about Latin is that you can put the words,530660.0,535609.0
29,"in almost any order. Especially in poetry, they really rearrange the words a lot, because",535610.0,541758.0
29,"you wanna line up the ones that rhyme, or you wanna line up the words for a",541759.0,544720.0
29,"particular rhythm. And so that means that you can have a verb and its nouns in, like,",544721.0,549948.0
29,totally different lines and totally different parts of the sentence. And so,549949.0,553388.0
29,you're trying to figure out when you're translating Latin poetry -- because that's,553389.0,556778.0
29,"what you do in intro Latin class. You don't learn how to, like, ask Caesar where to",556779.0,560399.0
29,"buy pizza, much as maybe that would be useful. You're translating Latin poetry. And you're",560400.0,566729.0
29,"going through these lines and being like 'Hey, I need figure out what",566730.0,569319.0
29,"the verbs are, how many of them there are' and, you know, generally, underline them and",569320.0,575349.0
29,then figure out which nouns are associated with which verbs. Then I can figure,575350.0,579129.0
29,"out which adjectives are associated with which nouns and so on down the line, so I can figure",579130.0,582648.0
29,"out what's actually going on in the sentence. L: And, conveniently, languages have different",582649.0,586268.0
29,"ways of trying different types of hooks on coat racks, so which ones are the nouns that",586269.0,591628.0
29,belong with,591629.0,592628.0
29,particular verbs and in what order. I think we should definitely say at the outset that,592629.0,597109.0
29,there are lots of different hooks and lots of different ways to arrange them,597110.0,601499.0
29,on coat racks both within a particular language and across the world's languages.,601500.0,605568.0
29,"G: Yeah, absolutely. I think thinking about this verb-as-coat-rack/noun-as-coats-that-you-can-hook-onto-that",605569.0,608799.0
29,is a way of entering into this.,608800.0,615318.0
29,There's a huge descriptive tradition of talking about each of these different types,615319.0,619599.0
29,"of relationships between the number of hooks you can have, and where they are, and",619600.0,623979.0
29,"what kinds of hooks they are, and what they look like, with all these specific names that",623980.0,627719.0
29,are often used there. But it's easy to get bogged down in terminology and,627720.0,630809.0
29,"think that you have to memorise all this terminology just in order to understand this central idea,",630810.0,636669.0
29,which is that verbs support nouns and verbs create the conditions,636670.0,641268.0
29,under which nouns can flourish. You can have some numbers of nouns to do that. I think,641269.0,647349.0
29,that's the big insight here. And I think you can then walk into the terminology,647350.0,651909.0
29,and have a little bit more confidence that you already understand the basic concepts,651910.0,654138.0
29,"involved. L: Often, you find that different languages",654139.0,656588.0
29,will have the same number of hooks. They might be arranged differently for reasons of the,656589.0,661888.0
29,particular,661889.0,662888.0
29,"word order of a language. So if you speak English, hopefully you can think for yourself",662889.0,667588.0
29,the verb is in the middle. G: There's this really great example of,667589.0,670278.0

29,It's a verb-y word that comes up when people learn grammar.,1461380.0,1465619.0
29,"G: Yeah, 'transitivity' takes as a metaphor that a sentence goes across because this is",1465620.0,1471298.0
29,from the Latin word 'to go across/to translate/to,1471299.0,1476079.0
29,"transport.' It goes across from the subject to the object. If you have a transitive sentence,",1476080.0,1483058.0
29,"it goes 'I see the book,' or a sentence that doesn't go across -- 'I",1483059.0,1489349.0

29,"metaphor has a bit of a difficult time with the sentences that have zero hooks, and",1495820.0,1501089.0
29,"four hooks, and some of these further expansions beyond what the original grammatical tradition",1501090.0,1505548.0

29,"L: Once we have a verb, we can get an idea for how many hooks it probably has as a default,",1509830.0,1515149.0

29,In contrast to,1532639.0,1534099.0
29,"regular 'I read the book/You read the book,' 'I made you read the book,' this 'make'",1534100.0,1539388.0
29,is just introducing another hook. You have 'I made you read the book.' Now you,1539389.0,1545819.0
29,have three hooks on a verb that formerly only had two.,1545820.0,1548759.0

29,"adding one of the same type of little particle, or adding one of the same type of little affix",1610350.0,1614439.0
29,onto the verb. There are good reasons to group them together when you,1614440.0,1618359.0

29,terminology is. G: So the terminology for this one -- the,1637200.0,1639808.0

29,They're useful if you know Latin. But these ones are called the 'Spray/Load Alternation.',1644519.0,1649668.0
29,And what I love about the Spray/Load Alternation is it contains examples,1649669.0,1652558.0
29,"right in the name, which I think more words should do. So you can say something like 'I",1652559.0,1657298.0

29,being added on like 'with paint' or 'onto the walls.' But you can,1679170.0,1682969.0
29,alternate which one you want to make the main hook that's attached to the coat rack proper,1682970.0,1686699.0
29,"and the one that's, like, the more peripheral one that's your coat hanger",1686700.0,1690719.0
29,one that's further away with the preposition there. There's a whole list of words that,1690720.0,1696288.0
29,have this alternation. It's kind of nifty that there's just a couple dozen,1696289.0,1701638.0

29,this because you want to maybe use them in psycholinguistic experiments. Or you can test,1708820.0,1713168.0
29,what happens if you give people certain types of pictures. What do they look,1713169.0,1715629.0
29,at first? If you give them 'I sprayed the walls with paint' versus 'I sprayed paint,1715630.0,1719440.0
29,"onto the walls,' you can give them the same drawing and see where they look first",1719441.0,1723439.0
29,and these kinds of things. L: Those examples are about adding hooks or,1723440.0,1726939.0
29,deciding what's a hook and what's a coat hanger. It is also possible to remove hooks,1726940.0,1731678.0
29,from sentences. If,1731679.0,1733729.0

29,coat racks for every single context. For some verbs we,1901779.0,1905308.0
29,"do have this. So if you think about, like, the similarity or difference between 'kill'",1905309.0,1909989.0

29,"remove a hook, we needed a completely different word. It's okay with a handful. English",1945070.0,1949709.0

30,"you know, admittedly, it's a bit of a grey area for some of them because both the gesture",285630.0,292849.0

30,have two different channels happening. You have the spoken channel and the hand channel,300830.0,305079.0
30,for the gestures. But signed languages do have components that really should be analysed,305080.0,311709.0
30,gesturally. I remember when I was learning -- I was in an Auslan class. And our Auslan,311710.0,317379.0
30,professor was showing us a story that someone was telling in Auslan. And then they asked,317380.0,324269.0
30,us to kind of pick out the signs. He wanted us to tell him what vocabulary we got from,324270.0,329969.0
30,the story. And there were a couple of items where we were like 'He opens a can.' And,329970.0,336039.0
30,"the sign teacher was like 'Oh, that's not a sign, though. That's just a gesture.'",336040.0,341219.0
30,"You could see people in the class were really like, kind of -- not confused, but there",341220.0,347750.0
30,is a boundary between what is a lexical item and what is just a gestural representation,347751.0,352839.0
30,from the story.,352840.0,353839.0
30,G: So the kind of thing you might find in a signed dictionary that is specifically listing,353840.0,358579.0
30,the signs and how they interact with each other grammatically? And you just decide to,358580.0,362079.0

30,G: That's what you're trying to convey?,365380.0,366379.0
30,"L: So that's kind of a good example. But all languages, regardless of whether they're",366380.0,371469.0
30,"spoken or signed, also use gesture as part of their communicative skillset.",371470.0,376469.0
30,G: An important part of the communicative skillset because it helps do things like solve,376470.0,380869.0
30,puzzles?,380870.0,381869.0
30,"L: Yes, it helps you do all kinds of cognitive things. If you are doing, particularly, spacial",381870.0,390700.0
30,things -- so if you're talking about directions or the relationships between objects -- you,390701.0,397419.0
30,tend to gesture more frequently. If you are trying to solve -- you know those rotation,397420.0,403239.0

30,G: And people will imaginarily gesture them?,412410.0,414979.0
30,L: [Gestures holding a round object and turning it different ways] If people gesture to kind,414980.0,417339.0
30,"of figure out the rotation, they tend to perform better. What's really cool is the gesture",417340.0,422389.0
30,seems to activate that kind of space-y part of the brain. And so if you tell people to,422390.0,426590.0

30,G: And I think it's probably worth mentioning here that we're talking about the kinds,465950.0,469059.0
30,"of gestures you do at the same time as speech, and they happen very much in parallel with",469060.0,474979.0

30,"L: And the thing is, it's true. What's really impressive about that is, if you think",483520.0,487229.0
30,"about -- if [gestures the round object] you do the rotation task, I'm starting to move",487230.0,492909.0

30,"I've even said that bit. The gesture and speech are really closely timed there, and",508330.0,513958.0
30,we can really mess this up for people. Some of the gesture experiments often sound a bit,513959.0,519148.0
30,mean.,519149.0,520148.0
30,"G: Oh, no!",520149.0,521148.0
30,L: But we can really mess this up for people by putting headphones on and delaying their,521149.0,524849.0
30,speech by just a fraction of a second.,524850.0,526919.0
30,G: Okay.,526920.0,527919.0
30,L: And if we delay the way someone speaks so they hear their own voice back a few milliseconds,527920.0,533949.0
30,"afterwards, it actually just completely disrupts their ability to gesture.",533950.0,538689.0
30,G: This sounds terrible.,538690.0,539979.0
30,"L: It's really, really mean. Another thing that we can do is we can often make people",539980.0,546199.0
30,more disfluent by preventing them from moving their hands while they talk.,546200.0,550809.0
30,"G: Yeah, there's this terrible, hilarious experiment where they get people, and they",550810.0,556109.0
30,"put them in chairs, and they say, 'Actually, what we're studying is the physiographical",556110.0,560068.0
30,"measurements of whether your skin is conducting electricity,' and so they strap them down,",560069.0,565429.0
30,and they put fake electrodes on their skin.,565430.0,567489.0
30,"L: And so they get them sitting here, and then they ask them to tell a story, and it",567490.0,573909.0
30,increases disfluency. It makes it harder to --,573910.0,575669.0
30,G: So they say more 'um''s and 'ah''s?,575670.0,577670.0
30,"L: They find it harder to remember words, and it's usually more likely to be nouns.",577671.0,582778.0
30,So there's something about gesturing that helps us remain fluent. And I think it's,582779.0,586809.0
30,part of why there's that public speaking training thing that trains people to use their,586810.0,593119.0
30,gestures more because there is a link between fluently gesturing and fluently speaking.,593120.0,598849.0

30,L: There's a whole kind of relationship between what's a gesture and what isn't.,616069.0,619219.0

30,for a proper gesture that makes you look more sophisticated as a speaker?,622660.0,626078.0
30,"L: Sure. And it may actually help you speak more fluently in more fluent sentences, which",626079.0,631078.0
30,is a nice benefit as well.,631079.0,632278.0
30,G: I also really like the bit about when kids are learning words -- so kids: They're,632279.0,638429.0
30,"first learning words. And they go through this one-word stage, and they learn things",638430.0,641898.0
30,"like 'doggy' and 'mama' and 'papa' and 'water' and stuff like this, and then",641899.0,649248.0
30,eventually they end up at this two-word stage. Before that...?,649249.0,652679.0
30,L: There's this really nice period in between where we have the -- so gestures are kind,652680.0,658948.0
30,"of important for adults and in their ability to speak fluently. But when we look at children,",658949.0,665878.0

30,G: One of my favourite examples of gesture mirroring the structure of language is from,852829.0,859028.0
30,a talk that I saw by Goldin-Meadow a couple years ago. She gives this example with English,859029.0,863958.0
30,"and Turkish, but it works in French as well. And I actually speak French, so I'm gonna",863959.0,866859.0
30,use French for the example.,866860.0,868268.0

30,"G: I know, like, a couple words in Turkish, but I couldn't pronounce it with confidence",870389.0,875338.0

30,often get something like [gestures a linear path going from her upper left to lower right],891529.0,893508.0
30,[Lauren gestures a linear path going from her upper left to lower right while indicating,893509.0,895278.0
30,"a rolling motion with one finger] 'down,' like 'rolling down the hill.' And then",895279.0,896278.0
30,"if you get Turkish speakers to do the gesture, or French speakers, in those languages, rather",896279.0,901719.0
30,"than have -- so in English, the verb-part is 'roll.' And then we have and additional",901720.0,905979.0
30,"bit that's 'down.' Whereas, in French, the verb part is 'to descend,' 'descendre'",905980.0,913898.0
30,"-- 'to go down.' And then you have to add on, separately, the 'rolling' bit.",913899.0,920738.0

30,"of rolling is really closely linked into the verb, [gestures the linear, rolling path]",978110.0,981109.0

30,"motion with her finger] if there is rolling, it's indicated separately. And so you see",987420.0,991469.0

30,All of the verbs of manner like 'rolling' and 'jumping' and 'bouncing' in English,998999.0,1003898.0

30,other people gesture -- the fact that people still gesture if they're blind from birth,1038930.0,1043639.0

30,deeply embedded cognitively and not something that we just learn by habit.,1058400.0,1063799.0
30,"G: Yeah, so it's not like we learn by seeing the gestures from other people, we learn it",1063800.0,1069579.0

32,about evidentials in a Tibetan language spoken in Nepal called Yolmo. I was interested in,442370.0,448628.0
32,understanding what different types of options they had for evidentiality but also how people,448629.0,453739.0

32,G: 'I got a new broomstick myself (I know it because it happened to me)?',474229.0,478158.0
32,L: Yeah. He wouldn't have to use something like 'I saw myself get a new broomstick.',478159.0,482568.0
32,That would be quite unusual. G: It would be kind of weird -- yeah.,482569.0,485538.0
32,"L: And in fact, he can use it. But if he used the form that's the equivalent of 'I saw",485539.0,490388.0

32,a lot of things you might think that having direct -- that direct 'I saw' evidence,755980.0,760679.0
32,is the best. But there are some situations where it would be rude to presume that I have,760680.0,765289.0
32,"that direct evidence. So, for example, if someone asked me if you were hungry -- they",765290.0,771958.0

32,like 'I just feel like these should go in an order.',808980.0,811359.0
32,L: That order pretty much matches up with what a lot of the literature says in terms,811360.0,815229.0
32,of a hierarchy of evidence being better or higher-quality or something. But if you actually,815230.0,820609.0
32,"look at the interactional choices people make when they're chatting, sometimes it's",820610.0,825208.0
32,better that you don't use something that's more certain or more direct because it's,825209.0,829899.0
32,rude or presumptive. G: Yeah. Can you use this type of thing to,829900.0,833219.0

32,I'm trying to make an indirect request. Can you use evidentials like that?,840600.0,843479.0
32,L: There's definitely times where it's more appropriate to ask questions or to state,843480.0,848609.0
32,things using more-direct evidence and there are times where it's better to state things,848610.0,852338.0

32,L: I still personally haven't seen a study that really convinces me of that. But there's,984900.0,989489.0
32,some really cute studies in children and how children acquire evidentiality. They've,989490.0,997059.0
32,"done this in Turkish and Tibetan, and the general indication is children can start using",997060.0,1002588.0
32,"them relatively young, from like 3 or 4 years of age, but often when they're really young,",1002589.0,1008779.0
32,they haven't entirely figured out what the evidentials are doing in terms of what they're,1008780.0,1015219.0
32,marking. They tend to use them to indicate that they're more or less certain. Certainty,1015220.0,1021970.0

32,"broomsticks in that dormitory. But then, just because you have that direct evidence, it",1038570.0,1045149.0
32,could still be wrong. Harry could be borrowing someone else's new broomstick. The literature,1045150.0,1051459.0
32,"on evidentiality often mentions that certainty is an inferred part of using particular evidentials,",1051460.0,1058679.0
32,but it doesn't have to be. Children tend to latch onto this certainty idea when they,1058680.0,1063659.0
32,first start using them and then they kind of refine what they're doing with them.,1063660.0,1067459.0
32,G: That's so cute. It reminds me of how children acquire numbers and time durations,1067460.0,1071569.0
32,"and stuff. L: Ah, yeah. We talked about that in our time",1071570.0,1074009.0

32,sometimes. L: That's a lot to keep in your head even,1123290.0,1125819.0

32,evidentiality come from in a language? L: One of the really great things about studying,1138300.0,1143049.0
32,evidentiality in the Tibetan languages is that Tibetan has a pretty comparable literary,1143050.0,1149049.0
32,"history to English. It's also unsurprising, then, that it has a similarly monstrous relationship",1149050.0,1155649.0
32,"between letters and sounds as English does. G: The older the writing system, the less",1155650.0,1161690.0
32,logical it is. It's just true. L: So many silent letters. And so that's,1161691.0,1168709.0
32,"really handy because we can see in old, written Tibetan from 800, 900 years ago that there",1168710.0,1176329.0
32,weren't these evidential forms. There were some older forms that have acquired evidential,1176330.0,1181849.0
32,meaning. In other languages where we have the ability to trace it because of a literary,1181850.0,1186759.0
32,"history or because related languages have a similar form without evidentials meaning,",1186760.0,1192359.0
32,one of the very common things that happens is a word that means something like 'see',1192360.0,1197469.0
32,"or 'perceive' becomes -- and especially for the reporting of speech evidence, a word",1197470.0,1203470.0
32,that meant 'say' or 'talk' -- becomes the grammatical form.,1203471.0,1207079.0
32,"G: Right. Okay. That makes sense. L: For example, the Yolmo form is 'ló'",1207080.0,1212789.0
32,-- that is from an older form that meant 'to say.' And then a new verb that means,1212790.0,1218229.0
32,'to say' has come into the language. G: Kind of like how we might talk about hearsay,1218230.0,1222659.0
32,"evidence, which literally comes from the words 'hear' and 'say' and becomes an adjective",1222660.0,1226589.0

32,"A lot of the time it is taking from other words. And then sometimes, for example, the",1230340.0,1237019.0

32,do they spread from one language to another even if they aren't necessarily related,1279990.0,1283449.0
32,historically? L: There's a few things that happen. One,1283450.0,1287200.0
32,thing is that evidentiality does seem to be one of those things that goes across language,1287201.0,1291339.0
32,families pretty well. If your neighbours are speaking an unrelated language but you speak,1291340.0,1297219.0
32,"it because you live in a multilingual society, which as we know is the norm across the world,",1297220.0,1303569.0
32,"you might be like, 'Ah, that's a really handy thing. I'm gonna borrow that into",1303570.0,1306839.0
32,"our language.' There are some really nice examples of borrowing across languages. Sometimes,",1306840.0,1313019.0
32,it's a form. We know that by Middle Tibetan a lot of these evidentials were starting to,1313020.0,1318849.0
32,"come into place and so a lot of the modern Tibetan languages spoken across Tibet, and",1318850.0,1324039.0
32,"India, and Nepal kind of have evidentiality because of this historic relationship.",1324040.0,1329709.0
32,G: And they borrow the specific words -- or they borrow the idea of it but use their words,1329710.0,1334129.0
32,-- or some combination thereof? L; Yeah. Some of them it's an evolution,1334130.0,1338149.0
32,from an older language that had evidentiality. For some of them it's contact that relates,1338150.0,1343519.0
32,to it. But also we know that languages can develop evidentiality relatively quickly.,1343520.0,1348219.0
32,It's something once you kind of start with that category -- so we've seen families,1348220.0,1353799.0
32,where it evolves multiple times in different languages in the area. One reason that's,1353800.0,1359799.0
32,given for this as a hypothetical is that evidentiality tends to arise in small communities where,1359800.0,1367709.0
32,people care about keeping track of information and knowledge and ownership of knowledge.,1367710.0,1372659.0
32,"G: Right. I guess that makes sense, especially if you're asking someone, 'Have you seen",1372660.0,1378509.0
32,"this?' or 'Have you heard this?' you don't know what to expect from that person,",1378510.0,1383059.0
32,"which requires a lot of prior context. Whereas, if you interact with a lot of strangers, you",1383060.0,1387479.0
32,don't necessarily have that context for everybody.,1387480.0,1389199.0
32,L: Yeah. And you're very concerned about not intruding on someone's knowledge or,1389200.0,1397319.0
32,"marking out very clearly how you know things, so you don't make assumptions about people's",1397320.0,1402219.0
32,knowledge and what they know and what they don't know. Some people have hypothesised,1402220.0,1407039.0
32,that's why it occurs a lot in smaller languages -- even though it's 25% of the world's,1407040.0,1412719.0
32,"languages that have evidentials, it tends to not be those bigger languages because by",1412720.0,1417789.0

32,"if I actually believe this, but I'd like to believe it a lot -- is that we're developing",1467480.0,1473529.0

32,"L: Oh, okay! Share your theory with me. G: I'm not committed to this theory, but",1477560.0,1484009.0
32,I like the idea of it. And maybe someday it'll be true. I think the example that I'm gonna,1484010.0,1490479.0
32,use -- because it's a theory that I talked about on Tumblr five years ago and I still,1490480.0,1494859.0
32,think it has some potential. The Tumblr-appropriate example that I had was 'They'd make a,1494860.0,1499390.0
32,terrible couple' because people talk about shipping a lot on Tumblr. I think you can,1499391.0,1504739.0
32,say this with varying degrees of certainty or belief or emotion or knowledge or something.,1504740.0,1512499.0
32,"I don't know if they quite qualify as evidentials because none of them mean, 'I heard that...'",1512500.0,1516989.0
32,"or 'I saw that...' but you can say something like 'Tbh, they'd make a terrible couple'",1516990.0,1520619.0
32,"or 'Imo, they'd make a terrible couple' or 'Iirc, they'd make a terrible couple'",1520620.0,1526149.0
32,"or 'Omg, they'd make a terrible couple.' This at least adds something -- 'To be",1526150.0,1531630.0

32,"and I'm not sure if it's a real... L: Well, they're definitely adding epistemics,",1542030.0,1545789.0
32,so that's more about the certainty stuff we were talking about. But certainty could,1545790.0,1550429.0

32,"G: Okay. So, we're like the toddler version of evidentials where we're putting certainty",1553990.0,1558519.0

32,to evidence. G: I like this.,1561380.0,1564059.0
32,L: We just need to create a bunch of acronyms that are like 'Isy' -- 'I saw yesterday.',1564060.0,1569109.0

32,actually provide all that context. An evidential form just kind of lets people know what the,1694380.0,1700830.0

33,it is a long and storied history. Every word is like this great little time-capsule nugget,225549.0,231809.0
33,of linguistic information. G: I like to think of English spelling not,231810.0,234789.0
33,so much as a phonetic approach to spelling -- we don't spell based on how something,234790.0,237669.0
33,"sounds -- we spell based on where a word comes from. So, if a word comes from Old English",237670.0,242238.0
33,"versus if a word comes from French, or from Latin, or from Greek, or from one of the many",242239.0,246878.0

33,"L: It's one of its benefits too. I'm gonna be pro-the-wacky-spelling, even though it",300230.0,304159.0
33,is a major hindrance to me in my daily life. It's worth pointing out that the house of,304160.0,308729.0
33,the Latin alphabet that English lives in wasn't necessarily a given. English has been written,308730.0,314219.0
33,at various times with runes and other writing systems.,314220.0,317599.0
33,G: That's true. The Latin alphabet was much better at spelling Latin than it was at spelling,317600.0,322809.0
33,"English, for example, because Latin actually only has five vowel sounds, and so it has",322810.0,326599.0
33,"five vowel symbols. That makes it a pretty easy correspondence. Whereas, English has",326600.0,330989.0
33,five vowel symbols but does not have five vowel sounds. It has 14-ish depending on the,330990.0,336599.0

33,"early English manuscripts where everyone borrowed this Latin alphabet in, but they borrowed",338910.0,344909.0
33,it in to fit their dialect. There wasn't necessarily a standard of spelling. It means,344910.0,349889.0
33,"that there are four main dialects when you look at Old English manuscripts, where, if",349890.0,355159.0
33,"you read them, they give you a really good idea of what the sounds were in different",355160.0,359109.0
33,"regions of English. So, we normally think of the Mercian, Northumbrian, Kentish, and",359110.0,365159.0
33,"West Saxon, so there're kind of four large areas of English. You can see some of those",365160.0,370909.0

33,"G: Yeah. The writing system became standardised, and even if you don't have a pronunciation",380440.0,384859.0

33,"in the 1100s, we might choose to represent those distinctions, or lack of distinctions,",408740.0,416589.0
33,in the writing system. But what happened was that English became standardised -- and people,416590.0,421939.0
33,talk about this as being part of the success of internationalised English is that we agreed,421940.0,427329.0
33,"on a standard and it got 'fixed.' It got 'fixed' around 1490, which is a weirdly",427330.0,434459.0
33,"specific time. In the late 1400s, a guy name William Caxton brought the first printing",434460.0,441299.0
33,press to England. And a printing press obviously deals with words in a very different way to,441300.0,445939.0
33,"manuscripts. If someone's handwriting stuff, they'll make different changes each time",445940.0,449929.0
33,they write something out. Whereas a printing press is just making lots of copies of the,449930.0,453929.0
33,same thing. Caxton had to decide what spelling he was gonna use in all of these copies.,453930.0,459559.0
33,"G: He was a lot more standard about it. He has this great anecdote, right, about trying",459560.0,463759.0
33,to figure out what word to use or what spelling to use because of all the different varieties,463760.0,467579.0
33,of English that were spoken in different regions there. And you can't please everybody. It's,467580.0,472519.0
33,"about 'eggs,' right? L: Ah, yes. Caxton's egg story, as people",472520.0,477109.0
33,"often refer to it. We know that there are dialects now, but at various points people",477110.0,483239.0
33,felt like the dialects weren't even mutually intelligible. People couldn't understand,483240.0,487830.0
33,each other in different parts of England. And there's a very famous story. Caxton,487831.0,491939.0
33,"was travelling in the north of England with a friend of his, and they were at a market,",491940.0,498549.0
33,"and his friend was like, 'Can I get some eggs, please?' And she was like, 'What",498550.0,502139.0
33,is this 'eggs' you're talking about? I don't speak French. I don't know that,502140.0,507609.0
33,"word.' Another person came in and said, 'Ah, he actually wants some eyren,' which",507610.0,512049.0
33,"is a northern dialect word for 'eggs.' And she was like 'Ah, yes. Yes. Now that",512050.0,517078.0
33,"you've used that good English word for them, I know what you mean.' Caxton tells this",517079.0,521309.0
33,story and it neatly encapsulates this idea that English was very disparate. It is still,521310.0,527588.0
33,regionally distinct as well. But Caxton had to decide what words he was putting in books.,527589.0,534499.0
33,"Famously, in a way that has influenced English ever since, he chose the southern dialects",534500.0,539789.0
33,"from around the London area. G: Yeah. So, he decided to write down 'eggs,'",539790.0,544559.0
33,which is why 'eggs' is standard in English now. But eyren is still very similar to the,544560.0,550208.0
33,German word for eggs. It could've ended up that way for us as well.,550209.0,552919.0
33,"L: Yeah. So, it's just because the printing presses were brought to London and not York",552920.0,558588.0
33,that southern English is more strongly codified. G: One of my favourite examples of this is,558589.0,564019.0
33,also that the printing presses started writing down English at the point at which we still,564020.0,569128.0
33,pronounced the K before N that has become silent now in words like 'knee' and 'knight',569129.0,575099.0
33,and 'know' that have the silent K. They were once pronounced /kne:/ and /knixt/ -- and,575100.0,580569.0
33,/knɔ/ or something like that? I don't know about the vowel there. That silent G-H in,580570.0,585809.0
33,'knight' was once pronounced /knixt/. And that double E was once pronounced as literally,585810.0,591059.0
33,"like a longer version of the vowel, which at the time was /kne:/.",591060.0,594169.0
33,L: That's because the printing press came in just before the big vowel shift happened,594170.0,599588.0
33,"and became standardised, which we talked about in our episode on vowels.",599589.0,602549.0
33,"G: Yeah. So, we're not gonna get into the details of the vowels, but there're all",602550.0,605338.0
33,"these sound changes that happened in English. At one point, these spellings were a lot more",605339.0,609088.0
33,"logical than they are now, which is part of this -- some of the discarded boxes up in",609089.0,614489.0
33,"the attic of the English language are like, 'Oh, yeah. Actually, we changed how to pronounce",614490.0,618039.0
33,all the vowels. Sorry.' L: This box just has a label called 'Silent,618040.0,621768.0
33,"E Used to Sound Like Something,' and I don't even know what's in it.",621769.0,626648.0
33,"G: Yeah. Like 'Silent K Before N was Once Pronounced' -- oh, no. We put that away",626649.0,631308.0
33,in a box. Sorry. L: Yeah. Don't need that. Up in the attic.,631309.0,634189.0
33,G: But some languages have actually done more rearranging and Marie Kondo-ising of their,634190.0,640929.0
33,orthography houses than English has. L: Which takes a very top-down approach. You,640930.0,647208.0
33,need the equivalent of a Marie Kondo for language in your language's life for that to happen.,647209.0,653028.0
33,"G: Yeah. Once you've started writing a language, and once people are getting literate and so",653029.0,656679.0
33,"on in the language, and you have books and stuff, it gets really hard to change a writing",656680.0,660189.0
33,"system because people, once they've learned it, they're like 'Yeah, well, it's fine.",660190.0,663268.0
33,It's got some silent letters -- whatever.' The people that would benefit from the change,663269.0,666278.0
33,"are the people who haven't learned to read yet, and they tend to have less power.",666279.0,669398.0
33,L: There's that issue. There's also the issue of you can do a full spring clean of,669399.0,675469.0
33,"the spelling house, but no matter how good you are at doing that, you're gonna end",675470.0,680058.0
33,up having more boxes. It just means that spelling freezes now. But the language is gonna keep,680059.0,685169.0
33,moving on in terms of how it's pronounced and what words are used.,685170.0,688299.0
33,"G: Yeah. You need to clean out your spelling house every couple of centuries, at least.",688300.0,692439.0
33,Maybe every century. Maybe every 50 years if you wanna be able to do it more gradually.,692440.0,695648.0
33,L: Could you imagine having to relearn spelling twice every lifetime?,695649.0,700278.0
33,G: This is why it's not always very popular. Then it creates problems with reading older,700279.0,706828.0
33,"books, too, because you go back and read a book that was published 200 years ago, and",706829.0,709999.0
33,"if you do that in English, that book is pretty easy to read. But if you do that in a language",710000.0,713778.0
33,"like German, which has a spelling reform every 10 or 50 years -- they'll release, like,",713779.0,717549.0
33,'Here's a few new spellings' -- it gets harder and harder to read your older,717550.0,720278.0
33,literature. One of my favourite examples of spelling reform is from French because they,720279.0,724588.0
33,"did this really great thing, which was, 'Okay, let's have a spelling reform to get rid",724589.0,731278.0
33,"of some of the silent letters,' but instead of just completely getting rid of the silent",731279.0,734979.0
33,"letters, they replaced them with an equally silent accent mark to indicate that there",734980.0,739058.0
33,had once been a silent letter here. L: That is so great. I like that because it,739059.0,743159.0
33,speaks to my interest in keeping that history of the word in the spelling.,743160.0,749008.0
33,"G: Yeah. If you know the history of the word, you're like 'Ooo! There was a silent letter",749009.0,753068.0
33,"here. This is great.' And if you're a school child, you're like, 'So, I just",753069.0,755808.0

33,my hands as I say this because that was how we always talked about it in school is you,763890.0,766990.0
33,have to make the hat sign with your hands. L: That's very cute.,766991.0,770278.0
33,"G: When you talk about that, you have to make a little pointy hat with your hands. There's",770279.0,774588.0
33,a bunch of words in French that a lot of them get borrowed into English before their S had,774589.0,780729.0
33,"dropped. And then their S dropped in French, and then eventually the silent S got replaced",780730.0,784378.0
33,"with the little hat. If you have a word like 'forêt' in French, which is spelled F-O-R-E-little",784379.0,789258.0
33,hat-T -- oooh! You don't speak French. I'm gonna make you guess what the English,789259.0,793818.0
33,word was that was there. L: Do I just stick an S in there? Is that,793819.0,797388.0
33,what you said? G: You stick an S in after the E with the,797389.0,800368.0
33,"hat. L: So, it becomes 'forest.'",800369.0,802278.0
33,G: Yes! Forest! L: I know this one because of my ongoing interest,802279.0,808299.0
33,in listening to The History of English podcast because you've put 'hôtel' there. And,808300.0,813719.0
33,'hotel' and 'hostel' are historically the same word. We borrowed into English the,813720.0,819198.0
33,French 'hostel' back when it had an S. And then we re-borrowed it as 'hotel',819199.0,823438.0
33,when it didn't have an S. And we've borrowed it to have slightly different meanings about,823439.0,827099.0
33,"the type of accommodation. G: And 'hôpital,' which in English was",827100.0,830549.0
33,"borrowed as 'hospital,' was borrowed before the H became silent in French and also before",830550.0,834759.0
33,"the S became silent. So, it's now pronounced /œpitæl/, but it's spelled like /hapitæl/",834760.0,840428.0
33,but with the hat on the O. L: When dictionary makers are doing etymologies,840429.0,844318.0
33,-- which is the histories of words in a language -- this is the kind of clue they can use,844319.0,849278.0
33,"to tell when something was borrowed into English from French, even if there's no written",849279.0,853618.0
33,record of it. G: Yeah. Because if you know when something,853619.0,856568.0
33,"became silent, you have this additional clue. There's a whole bunch of parallels between",856569.0,860178.0
33,French and Spanish as well. A word like 'fête' which has the hat on the E there --,860179.0,864888.0
33,"L: Oh, it used to be 'fest'! G: Right!",864889.0,867438.0
33,L: 'Fête' and 'festival' are kinda from the same root.,867439.0,870419.0
33,"G: And 'fiesta.' L: Oh, my gosh.",870420.0,871849.0
33,G: They're all the same. They're a party. L: It's a party of parties.,871850.0,875599.0
33,"G: 'Bête' with the accent, T, and then there's a silent E, but we're gonna ignore",875600.0,880499.0
33,that... L: 'Best'?,880500.0,881758.0
33,G: 'Best.' The additional clue that I'll give you is that there's a fairy tale called,881759.0,885578.0

34,"was talking about emoji, I like gesture as an analogy to what emoji are doing because",378470.0,382859.0
34,gestures and words work in concert with each other. You don't generally just do one or,382860.0,385938.0
34,the other. You often do both. I thought this made a lot of sense in terms of how people,385939.0,389299.0
34,integrate emoji with the words that they're typing. But I was just making a list of gestures,389300.0,393049.0
34,that occurred to me. It turns out that what I was also doing without realising it was,393050.0,398649.0

34,"L: There's good reason that you did that, because these types of gestures tend to be",406180.0,412028.0

34,"For example, not everyone uses the 'thumbs up' to mean 'good.'",417779.0,422168.0

34,finger. It's a sexual kind of insult. L: Yeah.,425919.0,428788.0

34,"Lauren, you were like, 'But we have a podcast. This is why I have not suggested that we do",552660.0,555869.0

34,"into gesture, and it was like, 'We're gonna need to figure out how to do a video.'",559570.0,561510.0
34,The thing that made me really excited about learning about gesture was that it actually,561511.0,566909.0
34,explains a lot about how we use emoji because there's a distinction in the gesture between,566910.0,573489.0
34,gestures that have conventional names and gestures that don't. We can see this kind,573490.0,577169.0
34,of pop up in emoji as well. L: I think this is because emoji are really,577170.0,582159.0
34,"-- humans want to gesture. I mean, we all gesture. People who have been blind since",582160.0,589069.0
34,birth will gesture even though they've never seen other people do it. It's a really strong,589070.0,593828.0
34,compulsion in human communication. I think emoji are allowing us to kind of return having,593829.0,600539.0
34,a body to online communication. We always think of typing in chat as really disembodied.,600540.0,606759.0
34,But having options like emoji allows us to start expressing those things that we want,606760.0,612069.0
34,"to express in conversation again. G: A lot of times, when we think about having",612070.0,615939.0
34,"a body online, we think about kind of a video game character-picker body, where you get",615940.0,620999.0
34,"the hair colour, and you get the clothes, and you have the haircut, and the eye colour,",621000.0,625129.0
34,"and these kinds of things, and what the figure looks like. But in actual fact, what people",625130.0,630189.0
34,are doing with emoji is a lot more about what you're doing with your body rather than,630190.0,635099.0
34,"necessarily having a character picker, like an avatar, that kind of follows you around",635100.0,638518.0
34,"and does all the stuff. You do that in video games, but it's less common for conversations.",638519.0,643049.0
34,"So, it was that interesting, like, 'What role do gestures actually have in conversation?'",643050.0,647239.0
34,L: We have a few decades' worth of literature of people trying to unpack this and come up,647240.0,652398.0
34,with descriptions of the different functions that gesture have. We've returned to the,652399.0,657129.0
34,existing literature in this area that's been researching this problem for years and,657130.0,661919.0
34,"looking at emoji in the context of that. G: Yeah. It was really exciting to be like,",661920.0,665059.0

34,"'emblem gestures.' Emblem gestures are things like 'thumbs up,' 'middle finger,'",676480.0,680708.0
34,"'peace sign,' and things like that. Emblem gestures have these really narrow constraints",680709.0,687278.0
34,for how you have to produce them in order for it to be the right thing. My favourite,687279.0,692318.0
34,"Canadian-Australian cross-cultural example of this is like when I make the peace sign,",692319.0,696309.0
34,I can make the peace sign with my palm facing out away from me or I can make it with the,696310.0,700398.0

34,"G: Why not, Lauren? L: Because that meaning is basically the same",710089.0,714249.0
34,for us as the middle finger is. It's an offensive gesture.,714250.0,717758.0

34,"G: One of my favourite stories about this is apparently Winston Churchill, during WWII",720930.0,726559.0
34,"-- so during WWII, they had this 'V for victory' gesture, which basically looked",726560.0,729419.0
34,like the peace sign. But Winston Churchill would often do it backwards. And there's,729420.0,733629.0
34,"historic records of people telling him, 'Winston, man, come on. You gotta stop flipping off",733630.0,738579.0

34,"in the exact right way, or it might mean 'eff off'. But these ones that have names and standards",759389.0,762629.0
34,"of form, they also add an extra layer of meaning to what you're saying. If you say something",762630.0,767309.0

34,that also have a similar property that aren't gestures physically.,794190.0,797979.0
34,G: Yeah. Exactly. Some of the emoji that became popular in the early stages of emoji -- things,797980.0,803159.0

34,L: Or 'Good job!' and the flame -- just to give a nice positive spin.,814259.0,818088.0
34,G: Yeah. Or the flame to make it positive -- that adds this extra layer of meaning,818089.0,822479.0
34,to 'Good job!' in the same way that adding a thumbs up emoji or a middle finger emoji,822480.0,827689.0

34,"L: Yep. For example, if I'm wishing you 'happy birthday' in a text message, I",928509.0,934388.0

34,of them are chocolate. Some of them are vanilla. Some of them are strawberry. They're quite,961770.0,966359.0
34,different across different platforms. But this doesn't seem to bother people in the,966360.0,968980.0
34,same sort of way. Sending someone a birthday cake emoji doesn't really have any additional,968981.0,973869.0

34,for variation. L: Yeah. We see a lot of variation in how,1039390.0,1043678.0
34,people use gestures. Whether it is present or not is not necessarily -- it's not obligatory,1043679.0,1050719.0

34,of the words involved and also gestures that don't seem to change the meaning of the,1107650.0,1111519.0
34,words involved. They're just kind of the supplementary illustration. The fact that,1111520.0,1114649.0

34,to see just how far we can take this?' G: This actually solved a problem for me too,1170549.0,1174899.0

34,G: Who doesn't love a good taxonomy? Here's a way of carving up the world into different,1179200.0,1185499.0
34,pieces that illuminate some of the differences between different situations. It's fascinating.,1185500.0,1190699.0

34,L: One day. G: Writing an academic article meant that,1232669.0,1235648.0
34,"I could say, 'Okay, here's the kind of basic distinction, and if you wanna see more",1235649.0,1238979.0
34,"with all the terminology in place, go check out this academic article that we wrote together.'",1238980.0,1242519.0
34,L: One thing I really like about the article is it allowed us to revisit some data that,1242520.0,1247249.0
34,you already had and come up with an analysis of how that fits into this emoji-as-gesture,1247250.0,1252799.0
34,paradigm. G: It let me solve some of the questions and,1252800.0,1257178.0
34,things that I had been wondering about from this earlier data. One of the things that,1257179.0,1261178.0
34,was really interesting that came up -- so I did a study with a smartphone keyboard app,1261179.0,1264579.0
34,looking at millions of anonymised examples of how real people use emoji in aggregate.,1264580.0,1270749.0
34,One of the things that we came across really early on in this data -- so I got them to,1270750.0,1275639.0
34,"extract examples of the most common sequences of two, three, and four emoji, because this",1275640.0,1281538.0
34,is a common thing that people do for a large data set of words is they'll say one of,1281539.0,1285629.0
34,"the most common sequences of two, three, and four words. So, let's try to do the same",1285630.0,1289408.0
34,"thing with emoji and see what happens because, obviously, we couldn't read individual people's",1289409.0,1293428.0
34,messages. This is a way of kind of extracting from that and figuring out what the common,1293429.0,1297619.0
34,sequences are. The most common sequence of emoji overall is [tears of joy] [tears of,1297620.0,1302339.0
34,joy]. L: Right. Okay.,1302340.0,1303539.0
34,G: The second most common sequence is [tears of joy] [tears of joy] [tears of joy].,1303540.0,1307329.0
34,L: Okay. Hmm... G: Do you wanna guess what the third most,1307330.0,1309778.0
34,"common sequence is? L: I'm going for, hmm, [tears of joy] [tears",1309779.0,1316689.0
34,of joy] [tears of joy] [tears of joy]? G: Yeah. Four of them.,1316690.0,1322609.0
34,"L: Amazing. G: Once you get to number four, I think it",1322610.0,1326339.0
34,"was two kiss faces. So, it did change eventually. We did eventually run out of [tears of joy].",1326340.0,1330979.0
34,"L: Just moved on to more repeating sequences. G: Turned out, we looked at the Top 200 sequences",1330980.0,1337038.0
34,"of two, and then Top 200 of three, and Top 200 of four, and about half of all of these",1337039.0,1341599.0
34,lists was just straight up repetition of the exact same emoji. This was really interesting,1341600.0,1347069.0
34,to us because a lot of the emoji narratives and media at that point were really excited,1347070.0,1351589.0
34,"about the idea of telling stories with emoji of like, 'Okay, if you have a [person] and",1351590.0,1356019.0
34,"then a [tongue sticking out] and then a [hamburger], maybe that means a person is eating a hamburger,'",1356020.0,1360019.0
34,or something like that. But that's not what people were doing. People were doing the exact,1360020.0,1363028.0
34,same emoji a whole bunch of times in a row. L: I remember when you did that paper because,1363029.0,1368658.0
34,"I was like, 'Huh. That's some really nifty data.' When it came to thinking about this",1368659.0,1374928.0
34,"in relation to gesture, there's nothing that really fits that with words. If you look",1374929.0,1379109.0
34,"at the top combinations of words, it's like 'and the,' 'I am' -- there's no",1379110.0,1384779.0
34,"repetition. You might occasionally get a 'very very,' especially in formal conversation.",1384780.0,1392009.0
34,But that's definitely further down than [tears of joy] [tears of joy]. If you look,1392010.0,1397409.0
34,"at gesture, you often get these repeating movements in gesture, often like an up/down",1397410.0,1403879.0

34,"these up and down repeating gestures. G: These very, like, podium gestures.",1407190.0,1412199.0
34,L: They're known in the gesture literature as 'beat gestures' because that movement,1412200.0,1416129.0
34,"is so rhythmic and observable. G: Yeah. When I found out about beat gestures,",1416130.0,1421209.0
34,"I was like, 'Wait. Okay.' First of all, it's one of the most common gesture styles.",1421210.0,1424609.0

34,"look over and be like, 'Oh, that person's doing beat gestures.' You don't often",1429000.0,1432709.0
34,"see people doing emblems in the wild. For all they're very exciting, they're fairly",1432710.0,1436719.0
34,"rare. Occasionally, someone will flip someone off or 'thumbs up' or something like that,",1436720.0,1440499.0
34,"but it's fairly rare. Whereas, you look over to any conversation, you're gonna see",1440500.0,1443639.0
34,"beats. I was like, 'Wait a second. Maybe people are writing [tears of joy] [tears of",1443640.0,1448799.0
34,joy] [tears of joy] because that's what they would do in gesture.',1448800.0,1452058.0
34,L: It makes sense in terms of the function because a beat gesture is often analysed as,1452059.0,1457268.0
34,being used to emphasise the particular words that they occur with. The more [tears of joy],1457269.0,1465379.0
34,"I send you, the funnier I find something. Or the more heart eyes emojis I send you,",1465380.0,1470689.0
34,the more I completely love something. G: Or the more plain heart emoji -- even,1470690.0,1476189.0
34,though that's not a face -- the more you love and support something or you wanna indicate,1476190.0,1480729.0
34,"your enjoyment of something. All this repetition, even when they aren't specifically hands",1480730.0,1486259.0
34,or faces -- even though they often are hands or faces -- seems to be serving a similar,1486260.0,1490189.0
34,kind of emphatic function as the fact that we repeat our gestures so much. It was really,1490190.0,1495069.0
34,exciting to be able to drill down into all of these different things that gesture can,1495070.0,1497759.0
34,"do and be like 'Oh, wait, yeah, emoji can do that too.' Even though the stories that",1497760.0,1502579.0

35,"versus the word 'pter'? G: Yeah, 'copter,' I mean, is an existing",217830.0,222359.0

35,"L: Then, when they started printing it, that 'F' looked like that long 'S' that you get",292380.0,297309.0

35,L: The final pair is 'heat' and 'tih.' G: 'Heat' -- also an English word. Seems,355840.0,362509.0
35,"like it works. 'Tih' -- with the 'H' at the end, I can make it, but it kind of",362510.0,369379.0
35,reminds me of when I was studying Arabic and I had to learn how to make words that ended,369380.0,373329.0

35,"G: That's something that I find really interesting because when we think of the sounds of a language,",394620.0,399068.0
35,"it's easy to be like, 'Okay, here's a list of the sounds in this language,'",399069.0,402659.0
35,"but it's not just about which sounds you have, it's also about how you can combine",402660.0,406198.0
35,"them with each other -- which ones can go at the beginning of the word, which ones can",406199.0,409038.0
35,go at the end of the word. Not all languages let you do all possible combinations.,409039.0,414068.0
35,L: That's because different languages have different structures for their syllables and,414069.0,418879.0
35,"what sounds can go together in a syllable, which is like a chunk of sounds together.",418880.0,424459.0
35,G: A word is made up of syllables and that kind of determines what one you can do. If,424460.0,429110.0
35,"you talk about words that are just one syllable long, that kinda gives you the maximal picture",429111.0,434128.0
35,of what sounds can combine in that language. L: What sounds can combine and what spots,434129.0,438929.0
35,"they can go in within that structure. In fact, the word 'syllable' comes from a Greek",438930.0,443049.0
35,"word that means 'goes together' or 'what goes together,' which is a really nice -- I",443050.0,448388.0
35,"kind of like that, that 'syllable' means what can hang out together.",448389.0,452969.0
35,"G: That's very nice. Also, just to clarify, we're not talking about signed languages",452970.0,456609.0
35,here because signed languages don't have sound-based rules for how they go together,456610.0,461049.0
35,because they don't have sounds. L: They're not stuck with this narrow-minded,461050.0,464668.0
35,problem of linear time in the way that sounds are when they all have to follow a string.,464669.0,469159.0

35,"own constraints, and we're just not gonna get into them in this episode. Yeah! Different",473050.0,476789.0
35,languages have different shapes for their syllables -- different ways they like their,476790.0,481388.0
35,syllables to be constructed. I like to think of a syllable as kind of like a burger.,481389.0,485388.0

35,at the syllable-burger as a whole. L: Different languages allow you to put different,502930.0,508219.0
35,"things in the burger and in different orders. G: Yeah, and some people -- there was a lot",508220.0,512489.0
35,of controversy about the burger emoji a while back because people were annoyed that some,512490.0,517939.0
35,versions of it had the cheese below the meat instead of on top of the meat. The order is,517940.0,523509.0
35,important when you put things in a burger. L: And what you include and how much you can,523510.0,527779.0
35,include in a burger definitely varies from place to place.,527780.0,531139.0

36,many people in general at the time. Perhaps more for them because they have several deaf,997480.0,1002998.0
36,people in their family who clearly lead a different life than mine. They told me about,1002999.0,1012758.0
36,"some deaf people, and I asked them questions. But they couldn't respond, and they said,",1012759.0,1018018.0

36,"about going to the village. Then, I went, and I continued to go. After a while, I felt",1076520.0,1083579.0
36,ready to begin to work. That's when the visits began. I watched Hilaria and how she,1083580.0,1089279.0
36,"worked with them. She recorded them speaking the language from the elders in the village,",1089280.0,1097079.0
36,especially for the new year. It was a fun activity. They had some celebrations. The,1097080.0,1107189.0
36,hours just continued all day and all night. It was really fun to meet some deaf people,1107190.0,1112959.0
36,there. That led me to meet other deaf people in the village. It wasn't just deaf people;,1112960.0,1117579.0
36,it was the whole life of Chatino people and that experience of socialising with people,1117580.0,1124589.0
36,and how they accepted and thought about deaf people. It was very natural. Deaf people don't,1124590.0,1131909.0
36,have access to education there. There's no support for a use of sign language in schools,1131910.0,1137459.0
36,-- in the local schools -- so maybe Hilaria may have mentioned that the schools only use,1137460.0,1142249.0
36,Spanish as the language of formal instruction. That's another problem on top of those who,1142250.0,1148029.0
36,are deaf. G: But they communicate with each other and,1148030.0,1152139.0
36,with their family and friends up in the village? L: Mostly just in the family. That's another,1152140.0,1160539.0

36,"well, who people talk with is really intentional. Anyone does not speak with everyone. It was",1167330.0,1178959.0
36,interesting. Part of their social life is that everyone is organised within the family,1178960.0,1187119.0
36,"and the extended family. Everyone who is in the family, they have kinship. They are in",1187120.0,1194899.0
36,"this family unit. It's like a speech community, when you go into and enter a speech community,",1194900.0,1203859.0

36,different than my life here based on the type of relationship that we have in some ways.,1213170.0,1218099.0
36,"It's very similar in that way for the Chatino people. For deaf people, their relationships",1218100.0,1225569.0
36,in the village are strongly associated with family and kinship. That's who they communicate,1225570.0,1230289.0
36,with mostly. I was fascinated to see how they made up signs in order to communicate and,1230290.0,1239389.0
36,to get what they needed for everyday life. It's a little bit different than mine. I,1239390.0,1245739.0
36,"work within linguistics all the time. I use very abstract, sophisticated terminologies",1245740.0,1251109.0
36,at times with my colleagues and my collaborators versus using language to make sure that people,1251110.0,1260839.0
36,"understand. With most Chatinos, they have their own language. They talk about what is",1260840.0,1267689.0
36,relevant in their life. That was fascinating and that became my dissertation topic after,1267690.0,1276329.0

36,"system, it's deaf and hearing people and family members in a group.",1305740.0,1310179.0
36,G: Because hearing people also use these signs as well?,1310180.0,1313279.0

36,they definitely do communicate with them -- or if they work with deaf people.,1319760.0,1324609.0
36,G: Did you find that it was like the Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language where they have a kind,1324610.0,1329109.0
36,of village sign language because there's a high proportion of deafness and they have,1329110.0,1333179.0
36,this kind of village sign language? Or is it a different thing from that?,1333180.0,1337259.0
36,"L: Well, it is different for many reasons. I think the community where ABSL emerged is",1337260.0,1346289.0
36,special because it is a large proportion. It's a village with a large number of deaf,1346290.0,1359549.0
36,"people who have been born there and have been in the same family -- so a clan, if you will.",1359550.0,1367489.0
36,"People in the community of 3000+ people, there's no other community like that that has ever",1367490.0,1372709.0
36,been discovered. It's quite special in that fact. Where I work is a very small number,1372710.0,1378749.0
36,"of people, maybe 10 deaf people in total, I think. That's a big comparison to the",1378750.0,1385489.0
36,"Bedouin village sign language. Again, people that I study are mostly related. If you can",1385490.0,1392059.0
36,"analyse the family and look at the kinship and the relationships, then they are all socialising",1392060.0,1398069.0
36,together every day. Deaf people in the family mostly have hearing people. They may have,1398070.0,1406449.0
36,some relatives or other siblings. It's not like there are deaf people like there are,1406450.0,1413779.0
36,the Bedouin sign language where there are masses of deaf people within families.,1413780.0,1417489.0
36,"G: Right, okay. L: That means that, I guess, if you look at",1417490.0,1427069.0
36,Chatino Sign Language or what I -- in academia you need to name things as separate languages.,1427070.0,1433409.0
36,"It's not really called 'Chatino Sign language,' but people who use the language don't have",1433410.0,1438499.0
36,"an official name for the language. They say, 'My language' or 'We're just talking.'",1438500.0,1442809.0
36,ABSL and Chatino Sign Language are quite different. Chatino Sign Language is much younger. The,1442810.0,1451819.0
36,structure looks very different. They depend on the family that they socialise with. At,1451820.0,1457279.0
36,"the same time, we have overlap with family signs. Everyone knows one another. Language",1457280.0,1464139.0
36,is common. The family signs feed one another if you can say that. The community has conventional,1464140.0,1474539.0
36,gestures that kinda feed the family signs as well. Many things are happening at the,1474540.0,1479739.0
36,same time. G: Is it kind of like the home sign system,1479740.0,1483509.0
36,that was at the beginning of Nicaraguan Sign Language -- when Nicaragua established the,1483510.0,1489799.0
36,first school for the deaf and all the people came from different villages and saw they,1489800.0,1494489.0
36,"each had their own home signs, and then they came in and developed Nicaraguan Sign Language",1494490.0,1498859.0
36,"because of the school? L: That's one way of looking at it, yes.",1498860.0,1505109.0
36,My feeling is that home signs -- what psychologists and linguists call 'signs' of one deaf,1505110.0,1512919.0
36,child in a family that they make up in the home -- I think there's a lot more diversity,1512920.0,1518939.0
36,"to how home signs emerge because, again, it depends on the interaction, whether you have",1518940.0,1525769.0
36,"one deaf child, or you have several deaf children, or deaf plus hearing interacting with one",1525770.0,1532339.0
36,another using sign language. G: This one's different because they have,1532340.0,1535349.0
36,"10 deaf people, and they're all interacting with each other, and so they can feed back",1535350.0,1538639.0
36,"into each other? L: Well, yes and no. They don't identify",1538640.0,1550469.0
36,as deaf -- culturally deaf. It's not a common belief. I'm not saying that it means,1550470.0,1558109.0
36,that they don't have an identity. It just means they identify themselves as a family,1558110.0,1562119.0
36,"member first. Then, they identify as a member of their community second. Everyone recognises",1562120.0,1571739.0
36,that they are different from other indigenous people who are not Chatino because of how,1571740.0,1577159.0
36,"they dress, the type of rituals that they perform in their daily life, etc.",1577160.0,1584119.0
36,"G: That's really interesting. L: Also, I guess, to recognise the difference",1584120.0,1591889.0
36,between them and other Chatinos within in the area. Deaf people do interact with their,1591890.0,1601399.0
36,"families, who are related. They visit one another. They will meet and talk, or they'll",1601400.0,1610779.0
36,"go to the same family events, parties, community events, etc. If their family isn't connected,",1610780.0,1619979.0

36,"If you have two deaf people meet at random on the street, they may say 'hello' if",1624760.0,1633509.0
36,anything. G: Because you don't talk to people outside,1633510.0,1636609.0
36,the family? L: They may not talk to one another. I'm,1636610.0,1640329.0

36,That took a while. G: Yeah. You've also done some work on ASL,1762260.0,1768529.0
36,"as well, right? L: Yes, after I graduated, I got a post-doc",1768530.0,1775219.0

37,"who work on Cha'palaa, which is a language of Ecuador in the Barbacoan family. Similarly,",887430.0,893159.0
37,they found these smell terms that kind of have a meaning that we know immediately as,893160.0,903528.0

37,"can also be burning plastic or burning hair, burning feathers, burning bones.",930410.0,934178.0

37,ever accidentally put your hair too close to a hair dryer or near a fire. We don't,937899.0,944028.0
37,have a good word for it. We have the word 'the smell of burning hair.' It's not,944029.0,949688.0
37,that we can't smell it and we can't describe it. It's just that we literally use the,949689.0,953679.0
37,"word 'hair' and 'burning' to describe it. Whereas, these words don't necessarily",953680.0,958958.0

37,make you sneeze. It's kind of grouping together something that I wouldn't necessarily have,1021189.0,1026519.0

38,is the difference between these two,187130.0,189349.0
38,words you ready okay the first one is,189350.0,192709.0
38,book mm-hmm and the second one is books,192710.0,197089.0
38,oh I know this one I know this one we're,197090.0,199699.0
38,good okay so the first one is when you,199700.0,203089.0
38,just have one book and the second one,203090.0,205219.0
38,books is when you have more than one,205220.0,207439.0
38,book how do I do you did great,207440.0,209569.0
38,congratulations okay good thank you I,209570.0,212029.0
38,have a speaker of English your English,212030.0,213949.0
38,vacant intuitions are working as,213950.0,215659.0
38,expected that's good to know seeing as,215660.0,218329.0
38,we're speaking English right now but,218330.0,220249.0
38,this is plurals you have sometimes you,220250.0,222559.0
38,have just one of something you have a,222560.0,223669.0
38,singular sometimes you have a plural of,223670.0,225199.0
38,something and in English the kind of,225200.0,227989.0
38,classic way that you form a plural is by,227990.0,229969.0
38,adding an S or this sound to the end of,229970.0,234019.0
38,a word we've talked about morphology in,234020.0,236539.0
38,a previous episode which is where you,236540.0,238789.0
38,add bits to a word to create more,238790.0,241009.0
38,meaning and plurals are just a really,241010.0,243529.0
38,nice bit of morphology in English I'm,243530.0,246139.0
38,very fond of them I like being able to,246140.0,248479.0
38,distinguish between whether I have one,248480.0,251208.0
38,book or many books hopefully all the,251209.0,254119.0
38,books yes ideally more than one book I,254120.0,256789.0
38,think that's the appeal of plurals they,256790.0,259608.0
38,just work more than one book and more,259609.0,261259.0
38,than one cake you know it just makes,261260.0,262969.0
38,everything better but there are also,262970.0,264469.0
38,other ways of making plurals not just by,264470.0,267109.0
38,adding an S or you know sir zu sound if,267110.0,270979.0
38,you have dogs in English sometimes you,270980.0,273529.0
38,make the plural by for example if I have,273530.0,275779.0
38,the word foot and I have the word feet,275780.0,278149.0
38,Lauren what's the difference between,278150.0,279829.0
38,these mmm I'm just gonna observe that,279830.0,282799.0
38,there is no s there but the second word,282800.0,285109.0
38,definitely means more than one foot it,285110.0,287389.0
38,does because English also forms plural,287390.0,289909.0
38,by changing the vowel sometimes,289910.0,291199.0
38,particularly for words that go back to,291200.0,293029.0
38,Old English and have this what's called,293030.0,295309.0
38,a traumatic a blot pattern but of,295310.0,296839.0
38,changing the vowels to indicate a,296840.0,298399.0
38,different sort of grammatical thing so,298400.0,300168.0
38,the fact that some plurals in English,300169.0,301849.0
38,form by changing their vowels was,301850.0,303978.0
38,actually really helpful to me back when,303979.0,305179.0
38,I was studying Arabic and undergrad,305180.0,306529.0
38,because in Arabic sometimes you add an,306530.0,309079.0
38,ending to make something plural but in a,309080.0,310668.0
38,lot of cases what you actually do,310669.0,311839.0
38,instead is you change all of the vowels,311840.0,314029.0
38,and sometimes even the,314030.0,315609.0
38,associations of how many vowels there,315610.0,317559.0
38,are or which consonants come together so,317560.0,319989.0
38,for example if you have the Arabic word,319990.0,321728.0
38,khitab which means book mm-hmm there's,321729.0,324399.0
38,also the word Cottam which means books,324400.0,326948.0
38,and so in this case you've changed the,326949.0,328839.0
38,ah vowel pattern that's a short e and,328840.0,332109.0
38,long ah - just too short,332110.0,333999.0
38,ooh scoot tube key tab coup tube it's a,334000.0,337299.0
38,little bit like English foot and fate a,337300.0,339188.0
38,little bit except that it's changing,339189.0,341859.0
38,kind of two vowels for the price of one,341860.0,343388.0
38,and in this case it's a bit more complex,343389.0,345818.0
38,as a whole system this is definitely an,345819.0,347378.0
38,oversimplification to say that it works,347379.0,348609.0
38,the same way as foot but the fact of the,348610.0,350529.0
38,vowels change is something that's kind,350530.0,352059.0
38,of neat and one thing that I found,352060.0,353408.0
38,particularly interesting about this,353409.0,354878.0
38,system is that it can also apply to,354879.0,357519.0
38,words that get borrowed into Arabic so,357520.0,359619.0
38,Arabic has the word else which means,359620.0,361658.0
38,money mm-hmm and the plural of it is,361659.0,363549.0
38,foolís so you take this FLS set of,363550.0,366848.0
38,consonants and instead of just having,366849.0,368408.0
38,the single a there you have and then a,368409.0,371109.0
38,long okay right that's fine but then,371110.0,373658.0
38,Arabic borrowed the word Bank from,373659.0,375908.0
38,English which is pronounced bunk as in,375909.0,377948.0
38,like a money bank like a money bank not,377949.0,379959.0
38,a river bank and the plural of bunk,379960.0,381728.0
38,because it looks kind of like cells it's,381729.0,383918.0
38,got you know consonant and then an A and,383919.0,385749.0
38,then two more consonants so the plural,385750.0,387339.0
38,of bang in Arabic is boo nuke like foo,387340.0,390459.0
38,loose you put o and then long in between,390460.0,394299.0
38,the three consonants how clever I always,394300.0,397568.0
38,enjoy it so much when two languages take,397569.0,399189.0
38,a word from another language and then,399190.0,400329.0
38,adapt it to the morphology of their,400330.0,403239.0
38,language and say okay we figured out how,403240.0,404528.0
38,to plural it we know how to polarize,404529.0,405698.0
38,words like this we're gonna do this the,405699.0,407228.0
38,way that that our language doesn't in,407229.0,408728.0
38,fact nepali borrowed the word kita from,408729.0,411158.0
38,arabic and it uses instead of using the,411159.0,414429.0
38,arabic form of the plural so in Nepali,414430.0,417579.0
38,you have one key tab mm-hmm but you have,417580.0,419829.0
38,two kita paddle ah so they also have a,419830.0,423369.0
38,suffix at the end of the word like,423370.0,425588.0
38,English does but they don't use the,425589.0,428348.0
38,Arabic form of the word but if you're,428349.0,430568.0
38,listening to people speak Nepali every,430569.0,433299.0
38,day you can often hear two key tab and,433300.0,436418.0
38,it's just as grammatical as two kita,436419.0,438999.0
38,paddle so it's not like in English where,439000.0,440799.0
38,the a C is obligatory if something is,440800.0,442718.0
38,plural you can just put the how to if,442719.0,444939.0
38,you want it or if it's necessary but you,444940.0,447278.0
38,can also omit it,447279.0,448339.0
38,whereas Hindi which also borrowed github,448340.0,451099.0
38,Hindi has obligatory plurals and so one,451100.0,454939.0
38,key tub and to Qatar be so closely,454940.0,457939.0
38,related languages you can't trust them,457940.0,459649.0
38,to always have the same obligatory nests,459650.0,461959.0
38,or not and what's interesting so Arabic,461960.0,464599.0
38,was very influential in a lot of,464600.0,465888.0
38,different areas because mm-hmm another,465889.0,468198.0
38,language that borrowed the word for book,468199.0,469759.0
38,from arabic was Kinyarwanda which was,469760.0,471649.0
38,spoken in rwanda and it subtly adapted,471650.0,473869.0
38,the form of the word instead of being,473870.0,475399.0
38,kita he borrowed it as iggy tabble,475400.0,477319.0
38,because can you want to really likes,477320.0,478549.0
38,words to begin an end with vowels and in,478550.0,480739.0
38,Kinyarwanda there's also a prefix biggie,480740.0,483888.0
38,which means that something is singular,483889.0,485779.0
38,and belongs to a particular class and if,485780.0,487489.0
38,you want to make something that begins,487490.0,488809.0
38,with a key plural you change a key to,488810.0,491449.0
38,evey so a key taboo is booked and Eve,491450.0,495499.0
38,eat apple with the B is books because,495500.0,498679.0
38,you always change Iggy to EB to make,498680.0,501109.0
38,something plural and they just took the,501110.0,502519.0
38,same pattern that they had in their,502520.0,503749.0
38,language and said yeah we can we can do,503750.0,505369.0
38,this with this word from this other,505370.0,506418.0
38,language what an exciting life the wood,506419.0,508759.0
38,keith up has had it feels like very,508760.0,510948.0
38,poetic that the word for a book traveled,510949.0,512778.0
38,around a lot you know it was a,512779.0,513739.0
38,technology the way that a lot of,513740.0,515598.0
38,languages have borrowed the English word,515599.0,517038.0
38,for computer a lot of languages borrowed,517039.0,518689.0
38,the Arabic word for book because,518690.0,519769.0
38,therapists were some early field have,519770.0,521299.0
38,books so so far we've had you can put a,521300.0,524869.0
38,suffix on the end of a word Kenya Wanda,524870.0,527239.0
38,has some prefixing at the start of a,527240.0,529699.0
38,word so where the morphology is Arabic,529700.0,532939.0
38,and sometimes English involves some,532940.0,534909.0
38,internal changes you're not necessarily,534910.0,537379.0
38,just adding or removing something from,537380.0,539719.0
38,the start or the end mm-hm these are,539720.0,541789.0
38,some of the strategies for pluralizing,541790.0,544489.0
38,but they're not the only ones what else,544490.0,546979.0
38,can we do one thing that I find very,546980.0,550069.0
38,satisfying as a plural strategy is where,550070.0,553639.0
38,you repeat the word and the repetition,553640.0,556249.0
38,is what makes it indicate that it's a,556250.0,559219.0
38,plural that's very economical it makes a,559220.0,561109.0
38,lot of sense so it's like saying book,561110.0,562789.0
38,and book book to mean several book yeah,562790.0,566028.0
38,intonation is one of the widely spoken,566029.0,567949.0
38,languages that does this so the word for,567950.0,570409.0
38,student is murid but the word for,570410.0,572719.0
38,students plural is murdered murdered as,572720.0,575479.0
38,one option for how to pluralize it ah,575480.0,577578.0
38,very nice and there's something very,577579.0,579578.0
38,visual about that form of plural,579579.0,582319.0
38,that I find very satisfying speaking of,582320.0,584659.0
38,languages that form their plural with,584660.0,586458.0
38,the prefix there's actually an analysis,586459.0,588619.0
38,of French so traditionally speaking if,588620.0,590569.0
38,you learn French in school you learn,590570.0,591859.0
38,like French forms of plural by changing,591860.0,593629.0
38,the ending the same way that English,593630.0,594888.0
38,does but actual faction French often,594889.0,597289.0
38,those s's at the end are silent pretty,597290.0,599838.0
38,much always right and so there's another,599839.0,602749.0
38,analysis of French whereby it's actually,602750.0,605119.0
38,that the plural is a prefix mmm okay and,605120.0,608328.0
38,this especially shows up in French words,608329.0,611208.0
38,that begin with the vowels from children,611209.0,613549.0
38,who are learning French before they,613550.0,615078.0
38,learn to read and write they often,615079.0,616939.0
38,assume that many words in French that,616940.0,619129.0
38,begin with a vowel actually have plural,619130.0,621469.0
38,prefixes so if you take for example the,621470.0,623929.0
38,word Amy which means friend in French,623930.0,626629.0
38,and the plural of it is also a me but,626630.0,629659.0
38,with an S at the end but you can't hear,629660.0,631189.0
38,the s no I could not hear that it is,631190.0,633799.0
38,completely silent there's nothing to,633800.0,635179.0
38,hear most of the time when you say a,635180.0,638359.0
38,word in French you put another word in,638360.0,640609.0
38,front of it and especially for a noun,640610.0,642528.0
38,you're often going to put an article,642529.0,643849.0
38,like the or my or something in front of,643850.0,645979.0
38,it so you would say Lani the friend lays,645980.0,649009.0
38,a me the friends and that's lei which is,649010.0,652578.0
38,the plural form of the but it has this s,652579.0,655669.0
38,that's silent and because that silent,655670.0,657439.0
38,asses before words it begins with a,657440.0,658578.0
38,vowel you pronounce that s like a huh,658579.0,661818.0
38,yeah and so the same thing with my,661819.0,664429.0
38,friend you have mon amie,664430.0,666369.0
38,Mei Zi me and again that a makes the a,666370.0,670818.0
38,seem a which is also the plural form of,670819.0,673039.0
38,my be pronounced as if it's actually,673040.0,675528.0
38,there I can totally see how as a child,675529.0,677448.0
38,you can see where this is going right,677449.0,679669.0
38,because like you don't actually speak,679670.0,681109.0
38,French and you're like oh oh it really,681110.0,683689.0
38,sounds like the singular is a me and the,683690.0,686448.0
38,plural is za me exactly Sammy,686449.0,689179.0
38,so you get little kids it's really cute,689180.0,691068.0
38,when they're learning to write they will,691069.0,692659.0
38,be like me za me and they'll write like,692660.0,695239.0
38,Z ami for friends okay that is okay I,695240.0,700398.0
38,have friends who like post this is what,700399.0,702528.0
38,they're like young children are doing on,702529.0,703938.0
38,Facebook like little notes that they're,703939.0,705739.0
38,writing for class they're talking with,705740.0,706969.0
38,ladies any it's so cute kids are just,706970.0,710448.0
38,great little paradigm analyzes aren't,710449.0,712729.0
38,they well and this is the kind of way,712730.0,714109.0
38,that language change could happen,714110.0,715099.0
38,because you could imagine if,715100.0,716299.0
38,French wasn't a written language or if,716300.0,718099.0
38,so you know some sort of catastrophe,718100.0,719029.0
38,happened in French people weren't,719030.0,720619.0
38,writing anymore you had a an area French,720620.0,722689.0
38,where they had stopped writing for a,722690.0,723859.0
38,while and they started writing again you,723860.0,725599.0
38,could imagine that people would have,725600.0,726589.0
38,reanalyzed it at this point like this is,726590.0,728329.0
38,actually what's marking plural in the,728330.0,729949.0
38,spoken version of French even though the,729950.0,731779.0
38,writing is preserving this other thing,731780.0,733249.0
38,and if you were to start writing it,733250.0,734809.0
38,differently in the modern era not,734810.0,736549.0
38,looking at what it did historically then,736550.0,738199.0
38,it would be very sensible to say that,738200.0,739879.0
38,the plural is actually does that mean I,739880.0,741139.0
38,think it's also worth just mentioning,741140.0,742759.0
38,that there are plenty of languages that,742760.0,744769.0
38,get by just fine without any plural,744770.0,747169.0
38,morphology adding onto words at all yeah,747170.0,749869.0
38,absolutely but I think all languages,749870.0,751819.0
38,have some way of expressing whether,751820.0,753079.0
38,their different amounts of stuff the,753080.0,755389.0
38,question is just do you do this you know,755390.0,757519.0
38,as a intrinsic part of particular words,757520.0,759679.0
38,or do you do this with extra words you,759680.0,762559.0
38,know you could say in English one book,762560.0,764089.0
38,to book many book a few book and these,764090.0,767509.0
38,words would convey also that there's,767510.0,769189.0
38,more than one book as well this is what,769190.0,770839.0
38,a lot of Austronesian and Pacific Island,770840.0,773749.0
38,languages do and they get by obviously,773750.0,776569.0
38,completely fine so for example teton,776570.0,779509.0
38,which is the language of Timor if they,779510.0,782629.0
38,need to mark something as plural they'll,782630.0,784879.0
38,just use a separate word which is Sara,784880.0,787609.0
38,or they so again they're using the,787610.0,790939.0
38,determiners a bit like French children,790940.0,793369.0
38,use when they can't hear the difference,793370.0,795049.0
38,between the plural and the single form,795050.0,797479.0
38,yeah I mean spoken French just,797480.0,798859.0
38,completely uses the determiners to,798860.0,800509.0
38,indicate what's plural it's just in the,800510.0,802129.0
38,writing we've talked about determinants,802130.0,803719.0
38,and how they have a lot of work to do,803720.0,805279.0
38,for tiny was just another thing they get,805280.0,807469.0
38,to do for TV yeah sometimes your your,807470.0,810499.0
38,the word can can take on that function,810500.0,811999.0
38,instead or you can you know use over a,812000.0,813709.0
38,number of words or you can do things,813710.0,815359.0
38,like you know for English words like,815360.0,817129.0
38,rice or bread you end up using things,817130.0,820189.0
38,like loaves of bread or you know grains,820190.0,823519.0
38,of rice cups of rice glasses of water,823520.0,827359.0
38,because saying Rice's or waters or,827360.0,830359.0
38,breads is a different thing and refers,830360.0,833809.0
38,to kinds of Rice's and breads rather,833810.0,836149.0
38,than specific bread items so we've,836150.0,839299.0
38,talked about different strategies,839300.0,840859.0
38,different languages use to make plurals,840860.0,844249.0
38,when we look at this across a lot of,844250.0,847039.0
38,languages and see what languages do God,847040.0,850159.0
38,we're doing typology Gretchen I don't,850160.0,851959.0
38,know if you knew that's what you were,851960.0,853249.0
38,doing right now we are doing typology,853250.0,854989.0
38,yes and there's a very cool website if,854990.0,857359.0
38,you're interested in linguistic typology,857360.0,858619.0
38,which is the world atlas of language,858620.0,860869.0
38,structures or walls and they have all,860870.0,863149.0
38,these interesting Maps pulling,863150.0,864829.0
38,information from all these different,864830.0,866059.0
38,grammars of all these different,866060.0,866869.0
38,languages and putting it on the map so,866870.0,868279.0
38,you can see you know how many languages,868280.0,870019.0
38,have prefixes for their plurals versus,870020.0,871759.0
38,suffixes for their plurals versus,871760.0,873259.0
38,something else because plurals of one of,873260.0,875749.0
38,those things that every grammar,875750.0,877369.0
38,describes if a language has plurals even,877370.0,879919.0
38,if it doesn't it's such a common feature,879920.0,881419.0
38,across the world's languages it's often,881420.0,883849.0
38,relatively easy to describe it means,883850.0,886519.0
38,that walls has its one of the biggest,886520.0,888319.0
38,parts of the survey it has over a,888320.0,890149.0
38,thousand languages which means that like,890150.0,892369.0
38,one in seven of the world's languages,892370.0,894769.0
38,are included in this survey which is,894770.0,896659.0
38,pretty impressive yeah it is pretty good,896660.0,899209.0
38,it's you know not all languages even,899210.0,900919.0
38,have grammars written of them or have,900920.0,902659.0
38,been converted into walls but that's,902660.0,904099.0
38,that's pretty high ratio for walls what,904100.0,905989.0
38,do you think is the most common strategy,905990.0,907939.0
38,in the survey of making plurals well as,907940.0,911659.0
38,a very anglocentric person I'm gonna say,911660.0,914839.0
38,suffixes you are correct,914840.0,916879.0
38,I don't know how distributed the survey,916880.0,919309.0
38,is it could just be if you look at the,919310.0,920899.0
38,map and where the plural suffixes are it,920900.0,923419.0
38,is really obviously an indo-european,923420.0,926229.0
38,Europe kind of area phenomenon yeah so,926230.0,929869.0
38,it's not quite clear if that's just like,929870.0,931159.0
38,indo-european languages are more likely,931160.0,932719.0
38,to be in walls in the first place which,932720.0,934069.0
38,is definitely true and so if we actually,934070.0,936529.0
38,just had grammars for a thousand,936530.0,938299.0
38,languages of Papua New Guinea,938300.0,939289.0
38,probably this ratio would shift but,939290.0,941629.0
38,plural suffix is a very common and the,941630.0,943729.0
38,next two most common are plural words so,943730.0,946849.0
38,not using any kind of morphology and,946850.0,948889.0
38,plural prefixes so putting something on,948890.0,951529.0
38,the start of the word rather than the,951530.0,953179.0
38,end but of course that's not the only,953180.0,955399.0
38,options that you have what are these,955400.0,957619.0
38,other options we talked about,957620.0,959029.0
38,reduplication already you can have a,959030.0,961549.0
38,change in the tone of a word so there,961550.0,963679.0
38,are some African languages that have,963680.0,965269.0
38,systems where the the tone or the pitch,965270.0,968089.0
38,of the word changes depending on whether,968090.0,970669.0
38,it's plural or not don't eat which is,970670.0,973339.0
38,obviously very different to something,973340.0,975319.0
38,like Mandarin tone which more people are,975320.0,977719.0
38,familiar with where the tone can change,977720.0,979519.0
38,whether it means a particular thing at,979520.0,982009.0
38,all,982010.0,982219.0
38,this is used grammatically,982220.0,983929.0
38,that's really interesting I know people,983930.0,985879.0
38,use tone for that another one of my,985880.0,987409.0
38,favorite less common types of plurals is,987410.0,990739.0
38,when you just have a completely,990740.0,992599.0
38,different word that means the plural,992600.0,994369.0
38,thing oh yes that is super great and,994370.0,996799.0
38,it's a huge pain if you're trying to,996800.0,998509.0
38,learn the language because you're like,998510.0,999709.0
38,okay great so instead of memorizing this,999710.0,1001329.0
38,one list of nouns and then saying I add,1001330.0,1002949.0
38,this thing to them now they're plural,1002950.0,1004539.0
38,you're like now I'd remember eyes to,1004540.0,1006309.0
38,lists of nouns and all of their,1006310.0,1008049.0
38,associations with each other so it's a,1008050.0,1009939.0
38,bit of a pain but like once you know it,1009940.0,1011799.0
38,it's very satisfying to be like oh yeah,1011800.0,1013719.0
38,actually these are we're ones,1013720.0,1015279.0
38,historically completely different words,1015280.0,1016509.0
38,and now just one of them is the plural,1016510.0,1018129.0
38,of the other it would be a very,1018130.0,1019629.0
38,interesting language to have this fascia,1019630.0,1021609.0
38,Gretchen I don't know if there are any,1021610.0,1023829.0
38,languages that do this for all of their,1023830.0,1025689.0
38,plurals but I think there are quite a,1025690.0,1027189.0
38,few languages that do this in a few,1027190.0,1028779.0
38,educators and one of them is English so,1028780.0,1030909.0
38,English singular is person and the,1030910.0,1033819.0
38,pluralist people and those are,1033820.0,1035739.0
38,historically completely different words,1035740.0,1037689.0
38,this thing happens across languages so,1037690.0,1040149.0
38,often and across different parts of,1040150.0,1041829.0
38,grammar that linguists call it's,1041830.0,1044079.0
38,ablation because one form just,1044080.0,1046869.0
38,completely takes over and so pleats the,1046870.0,1049569.0
38,part of the paradigm where the other one,1049570.0,1051459.0
38,would be yeah it's the same thing that,1051460.0,1052959.0
38,happens things like dangerous for two B,1052960.0,1055089.0
38,which is B and is our was and so like,1055090.0,1059349.0
38,why do some of them have B's in them and,1059350.0,1060789.0
38,some of them have double use some of,1060790.0,1062289.0
38,them have neither it's because they were,1062290.0,1064599.0
38,once three different verbs it's crashing,1064600.0,1066699.0
38,into each other yeah but that's that's,1066700.0,1068619.0
38,verbs we're not in verbs right now who,1068620.0,1070029.0
38,pronounce I think people in person is a,1070030.0,1072549.0
38,really good reminder as well that even,1072550.0,1074559.0
38,though English would just fall into the,1074560.0,1076569.0
38,walls category of a language that has,1076570.0,1078249.0
38,plural suffixes with the S suffix it,1078250.0,1080949.0
38,doesn't mean that it doesn't,1080950.0,1081849.0
38,occasionally use these other things like,1081850.0,1083859.0
38,foot feet which is just a modification,1083860.0,1087269.0
38,internal to the word or person and,1087270.0,1090669.0
38,people which is the solution or sheep,1090670.0,1093549.0
38,and sheep where there's no change at all,1093550.0,1095559.0
38,yeah so there are some words like that,1095560.0,1097629.0
38,in English sheep sheep moose moose emoji,1097630.0,1100659.0
38,emoji emoji is a really interesting one,1100660.0,1102879.0
38,because some people say emoji emoji and,1102880.0,1105129.0
38,some people say emoji emojis which kind,1105130.0,1107379.0
38,of brings us to the English side of like,1107380.0,1109419.0
38,do you adapt the plural for the way that,1109420.0,1112299.0
38,you do it internally in a language in,1112300.0,1113979.0
38,which case would be emojis,1113980.0,1115119.0
38,or do you make it more similar to what,1115120.0,1117538.0
38,the source language does in which case,1117539.0,1119428.0
38,it would be emoji because Japanese does,1119429.0,1121648.0
38,not have the English plural strategy of,1121649.0,1123329.0
38,just add an S to it and one of the,1123330.0,1125038.0
38,strategies that it does have among,1125039.0,1126358.0
38,others is just keep the word the same,1126359.0,1127978.0
38,but I think the best known example of do,1127979.0,1131038.0
38,you do the source language versus the,1131039.0,1133199.0
38,target language in terms of plural in,1133200.0,1134758.0
38,English is a certain little creature,1134759.0,1137128.0
38,with eight legs the octopus the octopus,1137129.0,1141209.0
38,which I just avoid talking about in the,1141210.0,1144478.0
38,plural at all to save myself a,1144479.0,1146699.0
38,grammatical crisis I admit that I have,1146700.0,1149488.0
38,also done this so if you're gonna,1149489.0,1151888.0
38,PluralEyes octopus as if it's English it,1151889.0,1154199.0
38,was just octopuses it's very easy but,1154200.0,1157888.0
38,you also have a there's a fairly,1157889.0,1159628.0
38,long-standing tradition in English of,1159629.0,1161128.0
38,when a word is borrowed from Latin to,1161129.0,1163798.0
38,make the plural the actual Latin thing,1163799.0,1166168.0
38,because historically many English,1166169.0,1167518.0
38,speakers did learn Latin and so you want,1167519.0,1169589.0
38,to show off your education by using the,1169590.0,1171478.0
38,Latin form even though it's in English,1171479.0,1172949.0
38,so if you're going to pretend that,1172950.0,1174778.0
38,octopus is Latin then you want to say,1174779.0,1176638.0
38,octopi however there is yet a third,1176639.0,1179128.0
38,complication which is that octopus in,1179129.0,1181108.0
38,fact is actually Greek octo meaning ate,1181109.0,1183778.0
38,and post meaning feet and so Greek does,1183779.0,1186839.0
38,not make things plural by adding I to it,1186840.0,1190678.0
38,so in that case there has recently,1190679.0,1192538.0
38,become popular a yet even more obscure,1192539.0,1194998.0
38,and yet even more pretentious to be,1194999.0,1197038.0
38,honest plural it's this leg you say up,1197039.0,1199888.0
38,to parties well this is where I used to,1199889.0,1203008.0
38,say octopodes but I have recently,1203009.0,1204658.0
38,learned that apparently it is for,1204659.0,1207719.0
38,maximum pretentiousness octopod ease,1207720.0,1210408.0
38,you've out pretentious to out,1210409.0,1212728.0
38,pretentiousness I know which just sounds,1212729.0,1216598.0
38,like I don't know like you know,1216599.0,1218278.0
38,Sophocles and Euripides and like another,1218279.0,1220108.0
38,Greek playwright because I guess they,1220109.0,1221398.0
38,are all Greek to be fair but our choppa,1221399.0,1223709.0
38,tease really really sounds like you,1223710.0,1225538.0
38,should be writing someplace I'm looking,1225539.0,1227308.0
38,forward to your Greek tragedy about,1227309.0,1228778.0
38,octave octopuses about those octopus,1228779.0,1233219.0
38,things sea creatures of all kinds we've,1233220.0,1236189.0
38,been starting to explore the different,1236190.0,1238738.0
38,options that you have for plurals across,1238739.0,1240959.0
38,languages which is part of why linguists,1240960.0,1244228.0
38,do typological surveys to see what other,1244229.0,1248038.0
38,potential things that languages can do,1248039.0,1250108.0
38,but,1250109.0,1251548.0
38,Ifind this kind of typology work is not,1251549.0,1253859.0
38,just useful and interesting as a,1253860.0,1255528.0
38,linguist doing linguistic analysis it's,1255529.0,1258388.0
38,also a really handy way to think about,1258389.0,1260339.0
38,language if you're learning a language,1260340.0,1263339.0
38,yeah like when you're learning a new,1263340.0,1264599.0
38,language it's interesting to be more,1264600.0,1266128.0
38,aware of sort of the search space or,1266129.0,1267928.0
38,like what are some things that some,1267929.0,1269008.0
38,languages do so that things are less of,1269009.0,1270778.0
38,a surprise to you if a language that,1270779.0,1272128.0
38,you're learning does something slightly,1272129.0,1272969.0
38,differently one of my favorite things in,1272970.0,1275248.0
38,language is doing things differently is,1275249.0,1277319.0
38,also that some languages don't have this,1277320.0,1280038.0
38,singular plural distinction they make,1280039.0,1282329.0
38,other kinds of distinction in how many,1282330.0,1284699.0
38,of something there is yep so so far,1284700.0,1286558.0
38,we've been looking a lot at the form and,1286559.0,1288358.0
38,where it goes or how it changes the word,1288359.0,1291538.0
38,and if it's compulsory or not but there,1291539.0,1294358.0
38,there is just more than single and,1294359.0,1296099.0
38,plural so between one and many we have,1296100.0,1300628.0
38,some languages that create specific,1300629.0,1302998.0
38,forms as well so we have some languages,1302999.0,1305398.0
38,that mark there are two of something,1305399.0,1307949.0
38,which is known as the jewel as in the,1307950.0,1311969.0
38,duo type jewel rather than the fighting,1311970.0,1316108.0
38,type jewel or depending on your accent,1316109.0,1318808.0
38,the glittering one I mean duels are also,1318809.0,1323459.0
38,done with two people I guess you fight a,1323460.0,1324959.0
38,duel between two people mm-hmm yep,1324960.0,1326668.0
38,vehicle the duel tense is fascinating to,1326669.0,1328678.0
38,me because Old English had a duel really,1328679.0,1331048.0
38,we squandered it yeah we squandered it,1331049.0,1333868.0
38,except there are still a few words that,1333869.0,1336898.0
38,are relics of the Old English duel that,1336899.0,1339418.0
38,we use all the time in modern English,1339419.0,1341819.0
38,really is this gonna be one of those,1341820.0,1344128.0
38,like now my eyes are open I can't unsay,1344129.0,1346528.0
38,this moment yeah they're they're not,1346529.0,1349319.0
38,even obscure okay so Lauren what's the,1349320.0,1352319.0
38,difference between both and all earth,1352320.0,1355138.0
38,and all both means true and all means,1355139.0,1360618.0
38,everything yeah so if I say both of us,1360619.0,1364738.0
38,went to buy some books versus all of us,1364739.0,1367589.0
38,went to buy some books all means three,1367590.0,1369268.0
38,or more you can't use it for two all of,1369269.0,1371278.0
38,us you and me Lauren went to buy some,1371279.0,1372778.0
38,books no no another one is either versus,1372779.0,1378988.0
38,any,1378989.0,1380219.0
38,I got either as a choice between two so,1380220.0,1383979.0
38,either of you can come and any as a,1383980.0,1386109.0
38,choice between more than I can't force a,1386110.0,1388449.0
38,definition of any that includes only two,1388450.0,1390639.0
38,yeah yeah like any of you two can come,1390640.0,1393129.0
38,you you just can't say that no oh wow I,1393130.0,1397149.0
38,have this tiny like space in my brain,1397150.0,1399129.0
38,that works as a jewel and I never even,1399130.0,1401259.0
38,thought about it the third one is gonna,1401260.0,1403569.0
38,be really obvious you also have neither,1403570.0,1405009.0
38,versus none right yeah so if either does,1405010.0,1408249.0
38,it neither also does it some people,1408250.0,1410169.0
38,insist on a plural dual distinction,1410170.0,1412839.0
38,between between and among whereas other,1412840.0,1415059.0
38,people don't have this distinction,1415060.0,1416529.0
38,that's what that distinction that,1416530.0,1418509.0
38,they're trying to get at is yeah but,1418510.0,1420459.0
38,it's just like English doesn't really,1420460.0,1421749.0
38,have a dual anymore so do we still need,1421750.0,1423579.0
38,it in these particular words but there,1423580.0,1425679.0
38,is still one in former verses first and,1425680.0,1429339.0
38,latter versus last so you know I read,1429340.0,1433509.0
38,this book in that book and the former,1433510.0,1435939.0
38,was really good but the latter wasn't,1435940.0,1437349.0
38,very good you can't do that with a list,1437350.0,1439029.0
38,of three hmm yeah but again those are,1439030.0,1441309.0
38,more obscure both an awl and either in,1441310.0,1443919.0
38,any just really blew my mind yeah,1443920.0,1446109.0
38,because my intuitions are so strong,1446110.0,1448419.0
38,they're right we can imagine if we did,1448420.0,1450669.0
38,this everywhere in the grammar like we,1450670.0,1452109.0
38,used to have pronouns most of the,1452110.0,1453999.0
38,pronouns used to have singular and dual,1454000.0,1456369.0
38,and plural forms in English like I and,1456370.0,1459369.0
38,we - and we all and we sneakily haven't,1459370.0,1463059.0
38,talked about pronouns at all because,1463060.0,1464469.0
38,obviously pronouns start just like an S,1464470.0,1466389.0
38,on the end of things the way that most,1466390.0,1468069.0
38,normal nouns do English doesn't even,1468070.0,1471189.0
38,have a grammatical eyes distinction,1471190.0,1472989.0
38,anymore between plural and singular in,1472990.0,1474729.0
38,second person you and you which is why,1474730.0,1477489.0
38,people innovate things like use or your,1477490.0,1479769.0
38,well I mean formal English doesn't have,1479770.0,1481479.0
38,a distinction yeah formal English,1481480.0,1483249.0
38,doesn't you guys you folks,1483250.0,1484659.0
38,yeah you know so like the pronoun system,1484660.0,1487269.0
38,is different did we we did a whole,1487270.0,1488559.0
38,episode pronouns earlier uh but yeah,1488560.0,1491139.0
38,English used to have a dual like,1491140.0,1492579.0
38,everywhere amazing and in fact,1492580.0,1495689.0
38,proto-indo-european the ancestor,1495690.0,1497589.0
38,language of English and most of the,1497590.0,1500769.0
38,other languages spoken in Europe with,1500770.0,1502179.0
38,the exception of a few and some,1502180.0,1503859.0
38,languages spoken in the Indian,1503860.0,1504909.0
38,subcontinent it had a dual and so there,1504910.0,1507669.0
38,are a few other indo-european languages,1507670.0,1509469.0
38,that still have it or still have kind of,1509470.0,1510969.0
38,relics of it one of them was Latin which,1510970.0,1513699.0
38,some fossilized forms like Ambo which,1513700.0,1516459.0
38,means both so if you're ambidextrous you,1516460.0,1518888.0
38,have both hands are in the right hand,1518889.0,1521168.0
38,yeah and also had relic forms in old,1521169.0,1526209.0

38,old Church Slavonic and there are still,1529659.0,1532599.0
38,a few dual forms in Slovene and sorbian,1532600.0,1534969.0
38,and if jewel forms in code - you'll,1534970.0,1538509.0
38,never guess what they call it in,1538510.0,1540398.0
38,languages where it encourages three sub,1540399.0,1543189.0
38,languages have a trial,1543190.0,1544719.0
38,these include Austronesian languages and,1544720.0,1547829.0
38,Austronesian influenced Creole languages,1547830.0,1550148.0
38,including bissalameh',1550149.0,1551709.0
38,and talk person hmm that's great so they,1551710.0,1554199.0
38,also have a dual right so you have a,1554200.0,1555308.0
38,singular a dual a trial and then a,1555309.0,1557528.0
38,plural after that in the pronoun systems,1557529.0,1560048.0
38,yes just in the pronouns okay pronouns,1560049.0,1562388.0
38,obviously because they're counting,1562389.0,1563528.0
38,people people tend to make a lot more,1563529.0,1565658.0
38,distinctions and keep them in pronouns I,1565659.0,1567849.0
38,should say there are other languages,1567850.0,1569499.0
38,besides into European that do have duals,1569500.0,1571869.0
38,so we looked at it and you pick have,1571870.0,1575648.0
38,dual forms but Greenlandic doesn't even,1575649.0,1577808.0
38,though it's related but it used to and,1577809.0,1579759.0
38,in an entirely different part of the,1579760.0,1581648.0
38,world quick way grab and other coy,1581649.0,1583898.0
38,languages have duals in some forms so,1583899.0,1587859.0
38,there are there are duals around the,1587860.0,1589359.0
38,world and there are some trials but that,1589360.0,1591788.0
38,is the most no one has ever come across,1591789.0,1594879.0
38,in natural languages something like a,1594880.0,1597599.0
38,quadrille which would be marking for,1597600.0,1600839.0
38,quadrille quintal sextile so and this is,1600840.0,1605109.0
38,why typology is interesting when you,1605110.0,1606969.0
38,find like there are lots of languages,1606970.0,1609428.0
38,with single and plural there are some,1609429.0,1611109.0
38,languages with jewel there are even,1611110.0,1613239.0
38,fewer with trial and we've not got,1613240.0,1615729.0
38,languages that mark a specific number of,1615730.0,1617859.0
38,anything more but we do have languages,1617860.0,1620648.0
38,that mark something that means a few so,1620649.0,1625178.0
38,something that's like more than two but,1625179.0,1628329.0
38,less than lots yeah I really like this,1628330.0,1631268.0
38,because English kind of does this is our,1631269.0,1633069.0
38,measure words like you can say like 1 of,1633070.0,1635648.0
38,something or a single amount of,1635649.0,1637298.0
38,something you can say a couple or a pair,1637299.0,1639339.0
38,which is 2 and sometimes occasionally,1639340.0,1642249.0
38,extended to be more than 2 like I'll be,1642250.0,1644768.0
38,there in a couple minutes if you're,1644769.0,1645699.0
38,there in 3 minutes,1645700.0,1646449.0
38,yeah I think that's still,1646450.0,1648178.0
38,in the thing people really argue about,1648179.0,1649528.0
38,this one and then we had things like a,1649529.0,1651628.0
38,few or a handful or a bit and then we,1651629.0,1655378.0
38,have things like many and several and a,1655379.0,1657689.0
38,lot which kind of approximate the system,1657690.0,1660538.0
38,as well but some like we'll just do this,1660539.0,1661888.0
38,in the grammar yeah some do it in the,1661889.0,1663748.0
38,formal grammar from all over the world,1663749.0,1666028.0
38,it's definitely not one of those like it,1666029.0,1667888.0
38,crops up a lot in this language family,1667889.0,1669628.0
38,or that language family it shows up in,1669629.0,1671428.0
38,Hopi in North America while Bri and,1671429.0,1673408.0
38,Australia languages of the oceanic area,1673409.0,1676638.0
38,apparently in Arabic for some nouns and,1676639.0,1679859.0
38,it's so common that it actually has its,1679860.0,1681689.0
38,own term which is pokel PA you see al,1681690.0,1685979.0
38,it's a very satisfying word to say pork,1685980.0,1688768.0
38,oh yeah I really like the word pockle so,1688769.0,1691558.0
38,you can look at number by strict sort of,1691559.0,1692908.0
38,counting and you can look at number by a,1692909.0,1694918.0
38,few and a lot and many are there any,1694919.0,1697439.0
38,other ways of looking at how many of,1697440.0,1698939.0
38,something there are so I may not have,1698940.0,1701579.0
38,been completely upfront with you,1701580.0,1704099.0
38,when I gave you the nepali example about,1704100.0,1706589.0
38,books okay so i can point at three books,1706590.0,1710219.0
38,and say kita paddle but i could also,1710220.0,1712888.0
38,point at like three books a couple of,1712889.0,1716099.0
38,notebooks and some pens and say key,1716100.0,1719398.0
38,table haru and it would still be,1719399.0,1721739.0
38,technically correct so keep that powder,1721740.0,1724589.0
38,doesn't just mean books because I can't,1724590.0,1726359.0
38,use books to mean the plural of pens,1726360.0,1728819.0
38,also books and associated materials like,1728820.0,1733378.0
38,books and stuff yep so the Nepali plural,1733379.0,1737008.0
38,is not only optional as I said at the,1737009.0,1739498.0
38,start but it also has a slightly broader,1739499.0,1742408.0
38,meaning in a lot of contexts so I could,1742409.0,1745319.0
38,say Gretchen huddle and it would be like,1745320.0,1747808.0
38,Gretchen and her family and associated,1747809.0,1751378.0
38,people's this kind of like when you say,1751379.0,1753388.0
38,like wishing you and yours a Happy New,1753389.0,1755158.0
38,Year or something like that yes,1755159.0,1757288.0
38,like you and yours is like you and your,1757289.0,1759569.0
38,family or kinfolks or people that you,1759570.0,1761788.0
38,are associated with you yeah that kind,1761789.0,1763739.0
38,of whatever that semantic meaning you,1763740.0,1765479.0
38,have that's kind of what how do is doing,1765480.0,1767878.0
38,in these sentences oh that's really,1767879.0,1769739.0
38,interesting it's a very elegant way of,1769740.0,1772048.0
38,representing we know you kind of made,1772049.0,1774329.0
38,this generally related content one of,1774330.0,1777569.0
38,the really nice things about plurality,1777570.0,1779849.0
38,is that it's often some,1779850.0,1781538.0
38,think that is very easy to see and how,1781539.0,1784719.0
38,its marked and how it's used so you can,1784720.0,1788048.0
38,use things like Google Translate to play,1788049.0,1790898.0
38,around you can look at examples in,1790899.0,1794138.0
38,things like children's books and you can,1794139.0,1795819.0
38,begin to analyze plurals a bit like a,1795820.0,1798908.0
38,linguist does as you're learning them,1798909.0,1801579.0
38,and going about understanding a new,1801580.0,1803798.0
38,language and having a little bit of,1803799.0,1805928.0
38,terminology around what this typological,1805929.0,1809099.0
38,possibilities are with plurals can make,1809100.0,1811418.0
38,it a bit easier to approach them in a,1811419.0,1813488.0
38,new language,1813489.0,1814268.0
38,I watched a demonstration of a,1814269.0,1817469.0
38,monolingual fieldwork scenario where you,1817470.0,1821768.0
38,have no language in common someone and,1821769.0,1823508.0
38,this was set up as a demo because the,1823509.0,1824829.0
38,people did have a language in common but,1824830.0,1826959.0
38,they set it up as a demo for the,1826960.0,1827978.0
38,audience and they pretended they had no,1827979.0,1829839.0
38,language in common and tried to figure,1829840.0,1831848.0
38,out some things about the language from,1831849.0,1834248.0
38,the volunteer and it was really,1834249.0,1836858.0
38,interesting because it's fairly easy to,1836859.0,1838598.0
38,ask somebody you know here's a stick,1838599.0,1841058.0
38,here is two sticks here's three sticks,1841059.0,1843158.0
38,you can kind of point at them and people,1843159.0,1845018.0
38,can generally figure out what you're,1845019.0,1845949.0
38,asking and they can you know answer that,1845950.0,1847689.0
38,and so it's one of the easiest areas of,1847690.0,1849728.0
38,a grammar to sort start approaching,1849729.0,1850898.0
38,rather than getting into more,1850899.0,1852158.0
38,complicated stuff about hypothetical,1852159.0,1853719.0
38,scenarios and this kind of thing it's an,1853720.0,1856118.0

39,to practice this kind of pseudo-conversational skill with a lot of different small kids.,134090.0,139049.0
39,You also see fun videos of this on the internet. There's these two twins in a kitchen. They,139050.0,143259.0
39,seem to be having this nonsense conversation back and forth with each other. There's,143260.0,147189.0

39,like this. There's a whole field dedicated to studying this from the perspective of linguistics.,179540.0,185139.0
39,G: Yeah. Conversation analysis is such an interesting subfield of linguistics because,185140.0,189689.0
39,"a lot of us think about the sounds or the words or the sentences, but there's also",189690.0,193009.0
39,this broader conversational level where there are also interesting patterns going on. A,193010.0,197219.0
39,thing that I found most satisfying about encountering conversation analysis was how understanding,197220.0,203309.0
39,"how there are different cultural conversational norms, which helped me navigate different",203310.0,208949.0
39,kinds of conversations that I was having in different kinds of norms that other people,208950.0,212199.0
39,"were having, even if you're all speakers, ostensibly, of English. Even if you're speaking",212200.0,215979.0

39,"type, or what region you're from, or various other factors. Understanding those more explicitly",220600.0,225559.0
39,can help make those conversations more rewarding. L: Conversation analysis has definitely helped,225560.0,230379.0
39,"me through holiday season, family conversations, interacting with small kids, job interviews,",230380.0,240689.0
39,all of these places where back and forth conversations happen. Understanding them from what's happening,240690.0,248139.0

39,"G: Yeah. Travel, when you're interacting with people from different backgrounds and",252530.0,256548.0
39,"stuff like that, also really helps with that. There's this great metaphor that gets used",256549.0,260448.0
39,"with conversation, which is already present in English in general, that conversation analysists",260449.0,265609.0
39,"have really seized on, which is the idea that conversations have a floor. When you have",265610.0,270568.0
39,"the floor, you're the one who's talking. So, I have the floor right now --",270569.0,273299.0
39,"L: I could interject, and I could take the floor. The metaphor is from places like parliaments",273300.0,279999.0
39,where there is a literal speaking area on the floor where a person comes to and does,280000.0,284149.0
39,"the speaking. In formal contexts there are formal ways to officially take the floor,",284150.0,290418.0

39,"to walk to the middle of the room or stand up. If you have been to Parliament, you'll",296439.0,302198.0

39,"G: Even in less formal contexts, like when you start going to school and you get taught",304939.0,310288.0
39,"you need to raise your hand before you talk, that's a way of saying, 'We've got 30",310289.0,313989.0
39,people in here and the only way to manage the floor is to do some sort of more formalised,313990.0,317348.0
39,"things.' Because, by default, the teacher has the floor. Or in some contexts you have",317349.0,321129.0
39,something like a talking stick that you can pass around and that also helps signal who,321130.0,324198.0
39,has the floor. L: Those formal ways of showing who has the,324199.0,326788.0
39,floor are great in formal situations or in large groups of people where lots of people,326789.0,332029.0
39,might be competing to be the one to speak or negotiating who's going to be the one,332030.0,338119.0
39,"to speak. Where there's smaller groups of people, we can also signal our interest in",338120.0,343109.0
39,"taking the floor. We can do that with our voice by kind of going, 'Uh, yeah' or",343110.0,348968.0
39,"kind of saying, 'That's a great point,' and then waiting for them to speak and then",348969.0,352299.0

39,that we kind of hold in space to show that we are ready to take the floor if someone,358870.0,363179.0
39,will give it over to us. G: I've been talking at a lot of conferences,363180.0,366888.0
39,on panels recently. The interesting thing about being on a panel of four or five people,366889.0,371258.0
39,is that you're figuring out how to navigate who has the floor because you're trying,371259.0,376008.0
39,to present a good experience for the audience and let each of the panellists talk about,376009.0,380258.0
39,their area of expertise. You wanna negotiate that 'Who has something to say next?',380259.0,384978.0
39,sort of thing. I've become very attuned to what I call the 'I have something to,384979.0,388679.0
39,"say about that' body language/gesture combination, which is like you have one hand that's kind",388680.0,393249.0
39,"of raised a little bit, just below the level of your face with maybe your index figure",393250.0,397508.0
39,extended and the other fingers kind of curled. And then your eyebrow's a little bit lifted,397509.0,402418.0
39,"and your mouth kind of half open. You might say something like, 'Uh...' Of course,",402419.0,406379.0
39,"I'm doing it, but you can't see it. But you can just picture that, 'Hello, I would",406380.0,408918.0

39,L: I think the really interesting thing about conversation analysis is it shows just how,447639.0,451948.0
39,"much negotiating we do. We might be talking about a topic over here, but so much of our",451949.0,457758.0
39,"energy about talking around that topic happens around the edge of who has the right to speak,",457759.0,462559.0
39,"who's gonna finish their turn, who's gonna talk next. There are lots of ways to not give",462560.0,467818.0
39,the floor over to someone. We talked a bit about the 'I'm willing to speak now',467819.0,473698.0
39,body language and things you can say. But there are also strategies to stop people from,473699.0,479579.0
39,taking their turn: continuing to speak. You can use intonation to stop people talking,479580.0,484788.0
39,over the conversation by making your voice go up a little bit at the end so that it makes,484789.0,490638.0
39,"it clear that you still have something more to say. Then, people will be less likely to",490639.0,494308.0
39,"interject. G: See, look! I didn't interject at any",494309.0,496579.0

39,L: Thank you very much for taking the floor-maintaining cue that I was using.,502330.0,508959.0
39,G: Even things like a filled pause -- when you say something like 'um' or 'uh',508960.0,514098.0
39,"or 'well, uh, I think, maybe,' that can be a way of saying, 'I'm still searching",514099.0,518999.0

39,you can use to maintain being the person who's doing the talking.,555370.0,561029.0
39,G: One that I found really interesting is the use of eye gaze in this because if you,561030.0,565439.0
39,"think about the simple notion of eye gaze, you might assume like, 'Oh, people are talking",565440.0,568819.0
39,"to each other. They must be looking at each other.' But in actual fact, what often happens",568820.0,571979.0
39,"is that the person who's listening is more likely to gaze at the person who's talking,",571980.0,575739.0
39,"but the person who's talking is more likely to gaze away. Then, the talker can use that",575740.0,580349.0

39,You can kind of give them some vocal feedback. But that gaze is also really important. It's,594180.0,600449.0
39,why people find it really stressful if they're the one talking if people are looking at their,600450.0,604759.0
39,phones because it indicates that they're not respecting that this person's talking,604760.0,609129.0
39,at this point. G: Right. We should say that there are different,609130.0,611649.0
39,sorts of gaze norms. Not everybody is comfortable maintaining eye contact and that can sometimes,611650.0,617439.0
39,result in conflict if people have different sets of -- whether they're expecting somebody,617440.0,622439.0
39,"to be holding their gaze as if they're listening or whether you can say, 'Actually, I'm",622440.0,625589.0
39,"doodling and that makes it easier for me to listen,' but it's not necessarily part",625590.0,628229.0
39,of the same set of norms. L: I'm also a very vocal supporter of people,628230.0,633029.0

39,G: I try to be that person when I'm a larger audience of that person who's just gonna,649740.0,653609.0

39,I have a very conflicting set of cues from you right now.',686870.0,690529.0
39,G: I was giving a talk a number of years ago. I had a person sitting in the back row at,690530.0,696149.0
39,"some point just put their head on their palm, like face down, like kind of facepalm, during",696150.0,700949.0
39,"the talk. I was like, 'Oh, no! What have I just said?' It turned out it was fine.",700950.0,706919.0
39,But it definitely freaked me out. L: Just a long day of talks from this poor,706920.0,711009.0
39,person. G: Yeah. One of the things that I think is,711010.0,713579.0
39,really interesting when it comes to conversation is how people structure the amount of silence,713580.0,721329.0

39,G: Have you ever been in a conversation where you felt like you either had a hard time getting,744760.0,750579.0
39,the floor because the other person was just talking so much you couldn't get a word,750580.0,753639.0
39,"in edgewise, or you're stuck with the floor because the other person just wouldn't talk",753640.0,757610.0
39,at all and you're carrying both ends of the conversation?,757611.0,760319.0
39,L: I've definitely been involved in conversations with you where I'm pretty sure other people,760320.0,766249.0

39,more the pace of conversation. I think it's partly just that it takes having a conversation,877610.0,883209.0

39,"this was the first time that I ever heard people saying the phrase, 'No, you go ahead,'",911100.0,915929.0

39,the thing that people do is just you both just keep trying and then eventually either,922720.0,927309.0
39,you give up because you didn't actually think your thing was that important or you,927310.0,930249.0
39,eventually get it out. Nobody takes any offense about this because that's just how conversations,930250.0,934739.0
39,"happen. Why would you ever tell someone, 'No, you go ahead?' You could just be talking",934740.0,939669.0

39,right to be the person who has the floor and is taking their turn.,966400.0,969629.0
39,G: Yeah. This was why it was really satisfying for me to read Deborah Tannen because she,969630.0,975079.0
39,has several books which have been very popular pop-linguistics books about conversation.,975080.0,980259.0
39,One of the distinctions that Deborah Tannen makes is between high-involvement conversational,980260.0,985059.0
39,"styles and high-considerateness conversational styles. When I read this it was like, 'Oh!",985060.0,990329.0
39,"Here's this thing that I've been doing, that I've noticed in different types of",990330.0,994629.0
39,"conversation where you have some kinds of conversation where you have this cut and thrust,",994630.0,999529.0
39,"and this back and forth, and this high level of overlap.' I think it's probably not",999530.0,1003759.0
39,"a coincidence, Lauren, that we became friends because we both have this type of conversational",1003760.0,1007379.0
39,"style, so we don't feel like we're interrupting each other. I've noticed that I tend to",1007380.0,1011969.0
39,"be friends with more people that have high-involvement. I'm sorry, high-considerateness people,",1011970.0,1015469.0
39,"I'm sure you're all lovely, but it just doesn't always click as much.",1015470.0,1018719.0
39,L: I think there's something about someone who you click with is in some way a factor,1018720.0,1024889.0
39,of how you interact. G: I noticed that I tend to be friends with,1024890.0,1029879.0
39,other people who also talk quickly or other people who also have this high level of involvement,1029880.0,1036048.0
39,in conversation. The thing that I like about the distinction that Tannen makes here is,1036049.0,1039688.0
39,that 'involvement' and 'considerateness' both sound really positive. They both sound,1039689.0,1043948.0
39,like really nice things to be. It's not like the 'fast talkers' and the 'slow,1043949.0,1047558.0
39,"talkers,' which sounds sound of pejorative for both groups to be honest. Both traits",1047559.0,1052748.0
39,that are really positive as long as you understand that's what's going on.,1052749.0,1056388.0
39,"L: I think it's worth remembering not only are these traits a scale and that, as an individual,",1056389.0,1062609.0
39,you can move up and down them depending on who you're talking to and the context that,1062610.0,1066449.0
39,"you're in, but also -- and we talked about this a little bit in our Episode 23 about",1066450.0,1074339.0
39,nothing and how silence can be meaningful in conversation -- the differences that we're,1074340.0,1079839.0
39,talking about here are millisecond differences. But we're so sensitively attuned to when,1079840.0,1088489.0
39,"we can take the floor, or when someone else wants to interject, that these differences",1088490.0,1094528.0
39,"are really small and there's not a lot of difference between individuals. But overall,",1094529.0,1099789.0
39,we're very sensitive to it. G: They're so tiny. The example that Deborah,1099790.0,1104209.0
39,Tannen has is she recorded some of her friends at a Thanksgiving dinner. Some of them were,1104210.0,1110558.0
39,New Yorkers and some of them were Californians. She found that the New Yorkers were move high-involvement.,1110559.0,1117119.0
39,The Californians were more high-considerateness. That's within even the same country. You,1117120.0,1121689.0
39,have two different coasts with two different sets of norms. You can build out that continuum,1121690.0,1129678.0
39,even more. I said I've noticed it in Canada. If you think of it in terms of particular,1129679.0,1135849.0
39,"countries or particular nationalities, something like maybe Italians or Spanish speakers are",1135850.0,1140849.0
39,"gonna be more high-involvement. Whereas, something like, I think, Finns was Deborah Tannen's",1140850.0,1144619.0
39,"example. In Finland, they're very high-considerateness. They have a lot of silences between statements.",1144620.0,1149498.0

39,her the type of turn taking that I find acceptable. G: The thing that I also found really interesting,1159380.0,1165058.0
39,about Tannen's research is that she also gives you a set of tips for what to do if,1165059.0,1171759.0
39,you find yourself in a conversation with someone who is at a different point than you from,1171760.0,1176248.0
39,the scale. L: This is a delightful applied use of conversation,1176249.0,1180949.0
39,analysis. G: It's so useful! I tell this to people,1180950.0,1183398.0
39,at parties because a) I'm that kind of person and b) it is really one of the most 'Here's,1183399.0,1189339.0
39,how linguistics can make your life better' examples that I have ever encountered. I think,1189340.0,1192808.0
39,"this is why people like her books so much. L: So, as a high-involvement person, if I'm",1192809.0,1197209.0
39,"gonna have a conversation with someone who has a really high-considerateness threshold,",1197210.0,1202638.0
39,"what should I do? G: Right. As a high-involvement person, something",1202639.0,1205949.0
39,we may encounter more often is that you're in a conversation with somebody and the other,1205950.0,1211389.0
39,"person is just not talking. And you're like, 'Oh, my god. I did not sign up to give a",1211390.0,1215788.0
39,"monologue, here. Why is this person not keeping up their end of the conversation? Are they",1215789.0,1220979.0
39,bored? Are they unengaged with me? I have to do all the work myself.' The temptation,1220980.0,1227109.0

39,"detail in the transcription is meticulous compared to, say, the transcripts that we",1643559.0,1649199.0

39,a lot of those overlaps that make it hard for people to listen. And then when Sarah,1665230.0,1669849.0
39,"does our transcripts, she cleans it up even more. We do this because we're not trying",1669850.0,1675368.0
39,to do conversation analysis on the transcripts. We just want something that people can have,1675369.0,1679418.0
39,a pleasant experience reading. That's very different to a conversation analysis transcript,1679419.0,1685469.0
39,where you're recording every single pause. You're really making clear where those overlaps,1685470.0,1691719.0

39,to it and even accurately recall conversation. We do a lot of editing in our head. I don't,1756809.0,1763870.0
39,think it's surprising that conversation analysis is really closely tied with the evolution,1763871.0,1768178.0

39,"regression to say, 'Actually, we're just gonna send it one message at a time rather",1810159.0,1815199.0

41,shall I say. L: Yeah. This is not naturalistic data at,351479.0,354539.0
41,all. G: Because I've been briefed. One of the,354540.0,358489.0
41,things that I was able to do is I was able to talk about something that happened yesterday,358490.0,361429.0
41,"and something that's happening right now and something that is gonna happen tomorrow,",361430.0,365549.0
41,but I was actually able to use the same forms of the verb for all of them. Let's do a,365550.0,370379.0
41,"little rewind. L: Right. In the past, you used the verb --",370380.0,374668.0
41,G: 'I'm walking down the street. I see this bird.',374669.0,377759.0
41,L: Present. G: 'I'm sitting at home. I'm eating,377760.0,381418.0
41,a delicious cake.' L: Future.,381419.0,383258.0
41,G: 'I'm going to the airport. We fly out to Rome.',383259.0,387209.0
41,L: I think the answer is that the relationship between tense and time is not as straightforward,387210.0,393599.0
41,as we might think it is. We don't have a past tense that is always used with past events.,393600.0,399519.0
41,"G: Right. Normally, if you're in a Ling 101 class and we're talking about tense",399520.0,404769.0
41,-- or you're in a language class and you're talking about tense -- and the definition,404770.0,408849.0
41,"that everyone gives about tense is, 'Well, it means time.' It kind of does, but it",408850.0,415189.0
41,also kind of doesn't. This is the complexity that we're gonna be trying to unravel for,415190.0,420219.0
41,the rest of this episode. L: We have something that's happening with,420220.0,424199.0
41,grammar. We're gonna call that tense. We have something that is happening with the,424200.0,429219.0
41,flow of time that's in the real world -- where there is language being spoken or not -- time,429220.0,435379.0
41,"is still ticking on. I mean, we've talked about how to conceptualise time in an earlier",435380.0,441409.0
41,"episode, but just thinking about the flow of time and then tense as a grammatical construct",441410.0,445638.0
41,that relates to it but doesn't perfectly map onto it.,445639.0,449429.0
41,G: What I was able to do in this experiment is I was able to use the English present tense,449430.0,454899.0
41,"to talk about actions in the past, and in the present, and in the future. What's interesting",454900.0,459909.0
41,"is that -- so English has another tense, which is the past tense, and I can't quite",459910.0,463929.0
41,do all three of these things with the past tense.,463930.0,467799.0
41,L: Give me an example of the future with the past tense.,467800.0,471519.0
41,G: 'I sat at home right now' is problematic. That has some tension there. It gets really,471520.0,479899.0
41,"tricky if I wanna say, 'I went to the airport tomorrow.' That -- hmm, no.",479900.0,485179.0
41,"L: I definitely don't have that as a valid utterance in this real world, no time travelling",485180.0,493019.0
41,"sense of how language works. G: Putting time travel aside, this is not",493020.0,497999.0
41,how English works. Many linguists talk about English as having two tenses -- past and,498000.0,504369.0
41,non-past. What this means is that the non-past tense is the one that I can use to talk about,504370.0,510839.0
41,any time space and the past tense I can only use to talk about the past. That's why I'm,510840.0,516729.0
41,"able to say, 'I walked down the street yesterday,' but not, 'I sat at home right now' or",516730.0,521389.0
41,'I went to the airport tomorrow' because the past tense is really restricted but the,521390.0,525379.0
41,non-past tense can be in any of these times. L: It also speaks to something that I think,525380.0,532308.0
41,"sometimes people find a bit confronting about studying linguistics, which is that the way",532309.0,537260.0
41,that they're taught the idea of grammar in English language classes or in grammar,537261.0,542219.0
41,"classes is that we have a past, present, and future. But from a linguistic analysis, English",542220.0,547819.0
41,is treated as a language with a past and non-past distinction. The non-past includes present,547820.0,553549.0
41,and future constructions. G: And sometimes this weird version of the,553550.0,560299.0
41,past that's used for storytelling purposes. Many kinds of past in English you do actually,560300.0,565229.0
41,"wanna use the past tense, but there's this one very specific storytelling thing where",565230.0,568278.0
41,"you can use the present -- or more accurately, the non-past -- even in something that happened",568279.0,572778.0
41,in the past to make it seem more vivid and more relevant to a particular current time.,572779.0,578909.0
41,"You'd have a harder time saying something like, 'The Norman conquest of English happens",578910.0,584648.0
41,"in 1066.' That would be a harder sell for English. You'd really wanna say, 'happened,'",584649.0,590099.0
41,"there. You could say, I guess, 'William the Conqueror comes across the English Channel,",590100.0,594099.0
41,"right? And he's got this big ship.' There, you're using the present to make it very",594100.0,597979.0
41,vivid. L: I feel so much more compelled when you,597980.0,601409.0
41,"use that present in past. G: That makes it seem very vernacular, very",601410.0,605938.0
41,storytelling-y. I'm doing this casual thing where you're not gonna see that in a traditional,605939.0,608999.0
41,"history textbook, but you might see it in a fun, vivid history podcast type thing.",609000.0,613509.0
41,L: I was kind of surprised when I took an English grammar linguistics subject just how,613510.0,619448.0
41,many different grammatical constructions around tense there are in the English because I had,619449.0,623979.0
41,"this very simple idea that there was a past, present, future -- done, done, done -- and",623980.0,628919.0
41,"it's like, 'Ah, this is why the Cambridge Grammar of the English Language is such a",628920.0,632419.0
41,massive book' because I hadn't really thought about the fact that the tense that,632420.0,637938.0
41,you use in that narrative past using the present form is -- the time is in the past but the,637939.0,644778.0
41,tense is not just using a past tense. G: This is why it's useful to have -- why,644779.0,650128.0
41,not just call it 'time' if tense just means 'time'? Why not just say 'time'?,650129.0,654148.0
41,"Well, it's because there's actually this difference in that the tense refers to specifically",654149.0,658428.0
41,a thing that is done in the shape of a language can be somewhat independent from what's,658429.0,663568.0
41,"actually going on in the world that you're referring to, as in the case where you use",663569.0,666849.0
41,the present to talk about the past. It doesn't somehow make it the past. What about the future?,666850.0,671328.0
41,"Because, Lauren, it seems like English, we can definitely talk about the future.",671329.0,675068.0
41,"L: There are forms that I can talk about like, 'I will go' -- well, I won't go to",675069.0,680068.0

41,I can do that for 'tomorrow' in a way that I can't do it for 'yesterday.',685009.0,688969.0
41,There's something happening there. G: The analysis of this in English is that,688970.0,694368.0
41,'will' and 'gonna' are treated like other types of things where you can add these,694369.0,700618.0
41,"sort of semi-verbs. If I wanted to say, 'I can go to Rome,' 'I might go to Rome,'",700619.0,705178.0
41,"'I wanna go to Rome,' 'I have to go to Rome,' 'I will go to Rome,' 'I'm",705179.0,709258.0

41,"gonna get into the terminology here -- all of this category of, 'Here's this additional",715459.0,720469.0
41,"word that you can add that adds this additional information.' Sometimes, that's a time-related",720470.0,725539.0
41,piece of information. But sometimes that has to do with desires or possibilities or other,725540.0,731068.0
41,types of additional meaning. That's not how English talks about tense. English tense,731069.0,738429.0
41,"generally is something that's part of the verb itself, whereas this is this additional",738430.0,743248.0
41,word that gets added. It's less obligatory in the future because it's a lot more legit,743249.0,748888.0
41,"to say, 'I fly to Rome tomorrow,' and 'I will fly to Rome tomorrow,' and 'I'm",748889.0,752179.0
41,"gonna fly to Rome tomorrow.' All of these are pretty good. Whereas, this case of 'I'm",752180.0,757789.0
41,walking down the street yesterday' is really this very one limited context. With 'I fly,757790.0,762438.0
41,"to Rome tomorrow,' there's a lot more places where you can use that. You don't",762439.0,765390.0
41,have to do this thing with 'will.' You have these other options like 'gonna',765391.0,769609.0
41,or just using the non-past form of the verb. L: There's something about obligatoriness,769610.0,775059.0
41,when it comes to tense. G: It kind of reminds me of -- remember the,775060.0,778919.0
41,episode where we talked about evidentiality and how some languages you have to indicate,778920.0,783018.0
41,the source of evidence that you have for something and other languages you can indicate the source,783019.0,787469.0
41,"of evidence, but you don't have to? L: Yeah.",787470.0,789118.0
41,"G: There's this similar thing going on with tense where, in some contexts, you have to",789119.0,793659.0
41,indicate this piece of time information -- or in some languages -- and in other contexts,793660.0,798169.0
41,"you don't have to indicate this time information. L: For English, it's a language where evidentiality",798170.0,804159.0
41,"is completely optional. You can add some words to express a phenomenon. Then tense, especially",804160.0,810438.0
41,"with the past/present distinction, is obligatory. G: Mostly obligatory. I think everything is",810439.0,816888.0
41,"a continuum, right? L: Yeah. I definitely am always wary of anyone",816889.0,821748.0
41,"who has discrete and absolute categories for things because every time you're like, 'It's",821749.0,827678.0
41,"obligatory,' you'll find a context in English like that narrative present where",827679.0,831619.0
41,"you're like, 'Oh, no! It's broken my brain.' Whereas, if you take a 'Let's",831620.0,835698.0
41,"just look at what the language is doing and build up our analysis,' it causes a lot",835699.0,840418.0
41,less existential anxiety. G: That's the other thing about looking,840419.0,844349.0
41,at what a language is doing is that it's often useful to look at it internally based,844350.0,850368.0
41,on whatever this language does in really unambiguous cases where it's tense. That's what we,850369.0,857118.0
41,can use as our diagnostic for these more ambiguous cases. If English didn't have past tense,857119.0,862958.0
41,"either, then maybe we would say that 'will' was a future tense. But because English does",862959.0,868698.0
41,"this thing with suffixes generally or irregular forms of the verb to be past, then we can",868699.0,874159.0
41,"say, 'Well, 'will' is clearly doing that's different from that and it seems",874160.0,877378.0
41,"like it makes more sense if we group 'will' in with 'can' and 'might' and 'should,'",877379.0,881418.0
41,rather than grouping 'will' in with the past '-ed' ending.,881419.0,885708.0
41,L: I think that's fair enough to start with the examples of what we have that are people,885709.0,891490.0
41,are very strongly expressing their reliable feelings about the grammar -- and work up,891491.0,896998.0
41,"from there. There's a quote that says this really pithily, which is, 'Languages differ",896999.0,901289.0
41,"essentially in what they must convey and not in what they may convey,' which is from",901290.0,907418.0
41,Roman Jakobson in a 1959 book. G: That's really pithy because it lets us,907419.0,913768.0
41,"say, 'Well, languages can all talk about time or they can all talk about sources of",913769.0,916738.0
41,evidence but that doesn't necessarily mean that they all have tense or they all have,916739.0,919778.0
41,evidentiality because those are the grammatical reflexes of those things in the real world.',919779.0,925118.0
41,"L: Just as we talked about English not having grammatical evidentiality, we have languages",925119.0,929948.0
41,that don't have grammatical marking of tense. The thing I find interesting about these examples,929949.0,937108.0
41,"is when we don't have something -- English speakers are like, 'Well, of course we can",937109.0,940599.0
41,"get by without evidentiality,' and then it's a bit more of a leap for someone who's",940600.0,945220.0
41,used to speaking a language with grammatical tense imagining speaking a language without,945221.0,949778.0
41,"one. But if a language must convey something with tense, that's gonna be very different",949779.0,954659.0
41,to being able to talk about time more generally -- without it being part of the grammar.,954660.0,959539.0
41,"G: Because even if a language doesn't have specific things that only do tense stuff,",959540.0,964419.0
41,they're gonna have words like 'yesterday' or 'tomorrow' or 'in the future' or,964420.0,967438.0
41,'in the past' or something like that. That's still gonna let you convey that.,967439.0,970948.0
41,"It's similar, again, to doing number on words. We have 'dog' and 'dogs' in",970949.0,977749.0
41,English but we could also just have 'one dog' and 'two dog' and 'many dog',977750.0,981078.0

41,"the specific, additional grammatical thing that's conveying that information.",986040.0,989778.0
41,L: Languages like Vietnamese and Thai and Mandarin and Burmese all don't have these,989779.0,998388.0
41,"grammatically obligatory markers. People will, if they need to in context, use words in much",998389.0,1004418.0
41,the same way in English we talk about tomorrow or later or whatever. They don't have that,1004419.0,1009758.0
41,same obligatory verb marking. G: I think that there's a Latin-based prejudice,1009759.0,1017938.0
41,that a lot of -- especially the European tradition of approaching language which is,1017939.0,1023058.0
41,"like, 'Well, if it's not a prefix or a suffix, it's not grammar.' That's not",1023059.0,1026688.0
41,"what we're saying because you could have a short little word -- Mandarin, for example,",1026689.0,1031749.0
41,has a question particle that you just put in sentences to make them a question. That's,1031750.0,1035749.0
41,a grammatical feature. English doesn't have an obligatory extra word to add to questions,1035750.0,1040428.0
41,just to make them questions. That's a case where you do have something that's obligatorily,1040429.0,1043938.0
41,"grammatical. So, it's not saying that there aren't other obligatory grammatical features",1043939.0,1047758.0
41,"that you can do even if your language is a bunch of short words rather than fewer, longer",1047759.0,1051969.0

41,to something?' L: If we had to say 'now' in English any,1055149.0,1060119.0
41,"time we talked about the present, then that's as much a choice of grammar because of its",1060120.0,1065729.0
41,obligatoriness not just because it's something that sticks on the end of a verb.,1065730.0,1070038.0
41,G: One interesting example that came up for me recently when it came to languages having,1070039.0,1076089.0
41,"tense is Scottish Gaelic, which is a language that I studied briefly when I was in middle",1076090.0,1082319.0
41,"school and then I've been returning to because they added Scottish Gaelic to Duolingo and,",1082320.0,1086739.0
41,"you know, it's a language. Something that's interesting about Scottish Gaelic is that",1086740.0,1091768.0
41,it kind of doesn't really for the most part have a present tense.,1091769.0,1096359.0
41,"L: Ah, interesting. So, you can obviously, once you start thinking about each language",1096360.0,1101388.0
41,"has a different way of approaching segmenting time up into grammatical tenses, it can be",1101389.0,1108849.0
41,interesting to look across languages as to how they segment them. Vietnamese doesn't,1108850.0,1113788.0
41,segment time up into any specific grammatical tenses. And then a language like Scottish,1113789.0,1118418.0
41,Gaelic has -- it has a future and a past? Is that what happens?,1118419.0,1123039.0
41,"G: Well, the thing that makes me hedge it a lot and say, 'kind of doesn't really,'",1123040.0,1128239.0
41,is because the only verb that has a present tense form is 'to be.',1128240.0,1132729.0
41,L: Okay. That's a big one. G: Right. It's a really important verb and,1132730.0,1136519.0
41,"it does a whole lot of stuff. Then, all of the other verbs have future forms and past",1136520.0,1144558.0
41,"forms, and then they also have -- and this is where you get a little bit tricky -- they",1144559.0,1148389.0
41,"also have forms like the sort of de-verbal noun form. If you have a verb like 'see,'",1148390.0,1153798.0
41,"there's no just 'I see.' That's not a thing you can say in Scottish Gaelic. Irish,",1153799.0,1159969.0
41,"I think, works differently. So, I'm not talking about Irish. I don't know how Irish",1159970.0,1162489.0
41,works. L: I'm trying really hard to not respond,1162490.0,1164648.0
41,"with 'Hm, I see.' G: You can say things like, 'I am,' in",1164649.0,1169869.0
41,"Gaelic but you can't just say, 'I see.' What you want to say instead if you're talking",1169870.0,1173869.0
41,about the present is 'I am seeing.' L: Because you are using the 'be' verb,1173870.0,1179668.0
41,"to do the present heavy lifting. G: Exactly. You can say, 'I am seeing,'",1179669.0,1184759.0
41,"'I was seeing,' 'I will be seeing,' and this all uses the same form of 'seeing,'",1184760.0,1189909.0
41,which is the noun-y form -- the same one that you could use for something like 'Seeing,1189910.0,1194298.0
41,"is great.' Then, you also have separate forms of the verb 'to see,' which mean",1194299.0,1198788.0
41,"'will see' and 'saw.' In the future, you can say, 'I will be seeing' or 'I",1198789.0,1204589.0
41,"will see.' And in the past, you can say, 'I saw,' or 'I was seeing.' But in",1204590.0,1208298.0
41,"the present, all you have is 'I'm seeing.' There's no just 'I see.'",1208299.0,1212079.0
41,L: It's a bit like the English future in terms of obligatoriness being a slightly squishy,1212080.0,1217609.0
41,"concept. G: Right. Obligatoriness is slightly different,",1217610.0,1219548.0
41,and this is why. It kind of has a present because 'to be' conjugates everywhere,1219549.0,1223979.0
41,"in all of the different forms. It's also weird because 'have,' which you might",1223980.0,1228548.0
41,"think is also a pretty basic verb, is expressed in Gaelic by saying something is 'at'",1228549.0,1232979.0
41,"someone. If I say, 'I have a cat,' I would say something like, 'A cat is at me.'",1232980.0,1237668.0

41,tense in English -- that's where it will develop. That would be interesting because,1825919.0,1829048.0

42,one type of fieldwork that happens is you have bilingual fieldwork where you have a,1837850.0,1840799.0

42,In a monolingual context -- and this was especially more common before globalisation,1855320.0,1859428.0
42,was quite as much of a thing -- you have a linguist who's asking somebody about a,1859429.0,1864048.0

43,people would switch pronouns in the middle of the conversation and not necessarily notice,396919.0,403628.0
43,it. Or I would constantly be having a conversation where one speaker -- talking about the same,403629.0,409918.0
43,person -- one speaker is using one set of pronouns and the other speaker is using the,409919.0,413198.0
43,other set of pronouns. None of this is something that can be adequately described in your grad,413199.0,422748.0
43,"school semantics or syntax textbook. What you're going to see is something like, 'Mary",422749.0,427778.0

43,the time. One of the things where I had this perspective that previous linguists had not,442490.0,450758.0
43,"had. So, I was really pulled to say I want syntax and semantics and sociolinguistics",450759.0,459159.0
43,-- I really want us to be able to explain this. Our theory is inadequate if we are throwing,459160.0,464388.0

43,that I liked syntax first and being pulled towards thinking about gender and pronouns,484300.0,489668.0

43,from sociolinguistics about addressing these types of things better.,531830.0,535629.0
43,K: Yeah. This is something where at my graduate institution where I got my PhD there is a,535630.0,543339.0

43,"just, 'Oh, well, we'll make the syntax part of it a little more vague and underspecified,'",637470.0,644719.0
43,because there're syntactic consequences where stuff has to agree with itself. If you,644720.0,650869.0
43,"use a pronoun in a sentence and then you're gonna use another pronoun later, the rules",650870.0,655179.0
43,are different than if you use a name and then use a pronoun later. The example I gave you,655180.0,661129.0
43,of 'Mary likes himself' where I said it sort of depends -- I do hear people using,661130.0,666639.0
43,pronouns in this way where it doesn't seem to be totally linked to the name itself. A,666640.0,673389.0

43,K: Yes. This is something where people do it about cis people -- about not non-binary,767720.0,772669.0
43,"people too. This is something where I noticed it in undergrad, actually. A friend of mine",772670.0,777859.0
43,was telling us he had gone on a hot date last night. We knew what kind of gender that he,777860.0,783759.0
43,"was dating. So, it wasn't that we didn't know the likely gender of who he was talking",783760.0,790109.0

43,"and saying, 'Oh, yeah, they picked me up. They were driving this beautiful car' and",795270.0,799349.0

43,"in particular is that it doesn't tell you anything about the gender. It can imply things,",835310.0,840059.0
43,but it can't specifically tell you things. People have the option to use 'they' pretty,840060.0,847699.0
43,much all the time. People do use it to give you a little more detail and a little less,847700.0,853769.0
43,"detail. When they're giving you more detail, sometimes that can give you additional of",853770.0,858950.0

43,"like, 'Well, gender's kind of not relevant for this part. This is the part where I don't",867650.0,871819.0
43,think it's important to talk about the specific gender of the person.' It's not that the,871820.0,875729.0
43,gender stopped existing. It's just that we have this option of turning the dial up,875730.0,881559.0
43,of how much we wanna include. This opportunity to switch and change pronouns in some contexts,881560.0,889419.0
43,but not others is something that also brought up a bunch of questions for me as a student,889420.0,895029.0
43,in graduate school learning about sociolinguistics because the other thing is that sociolinguists,895030.0,900149.0
43,"talk about gender, but they talk about it in the very binary way -- or up until a certain",900150.0,906129.0

43,"this, and women mostly do this.' No mention of non-binary people. For one thing, they",917300.0,921909.0
43,"did not include any in the study. For another thing, many of the authors of early sociolinguistics",921910.0,928469.0
43,work just didn't really have access to LGBT communities in the 60s and 70s. Or it was,928470.0,936679.0

43,answers that you've ended up with? K: One of the things that I'm trying to,996430.0,1002219.0

43,"English, and English has had these in the past, but pronouns that encode this very social",1006970.0,1013729.0

43,G: Things like formal versus informal 'you' and these kinds of things?,1023930.0,1028208.0
43,K: Exactly. One of the things that I've come up with is if we think of this existing,1028209.0,1034568.0
43,"thing, and there's some really great research in Spanish of Latin America where people will",1034569.0,1041588.0
43,switch between 'tu' and 'usted' and 'voseo' -- 'tu' being the informal,1041589.0,1046688.0
43,"'you,' and 'usted' being a formal 'you,' and 'voseo' is a form of the",1046689.0,1051378.0

43,they totally switch in the middle of the conversation as a way of accomplishing certain social goals.,1063830.0,1068619.0
43,This example given by Raymond 2016 where a 911 caller -- he's a tourist. He's speaking,1068620.0,1076869.0
43,Spanish and he's calling and talking to the 911 dispatcher. At the beginning of the,1076870.0,1083529.0

43,"K: Yeah. Later in the conversation, when she's starting to ask for paperwork or receipts",1107890.0,1114139.0
43,"or stuff and he's starting to get nervous, he switches to the 'usted' forms because",1114140.0,1120699.0
43,-- so Raymond conceptualises that the reason for this is that he now sees her as a gatekeeper,1120700.0,1127599.0
43,"to something that he wants. Now, he has to appease her rather than talk down to her.",1127600.0,1135508.0
43,This is the thing of this all happens with gender too. It's a little bit more abstract,1135509.0,1141808.0
43,because the social relationships that we're talking about are not up or down. You can,1141809.0,1147048.0
43,"map them onto hierarchies, but they don't cleanly follow. Thinking about systems that",1147049.0,1155508.0

43,K: And depending on gender and depending on specific age -- yeah. There's a lot of,1192220.0,1197428.0
43,"rich expressive content there. Basically, the idea that comes out of my research is",1197429.0,1205469.0
43,"that you can use gender features -- and I'm doing air quotes, 'gender features' -- where",1205470.0,1209649.0

43,K: One of things you'll notice when you watch the show is that the contestants and,1242549.0,1247308.0
43,the judges mostly use 'she' for the contestants who are all drag queens but not always. It,1247309.0,1255479.0
43,depends on how they feel about a particular queen. What you see with this contestant who's,1255480.0,1264388.0
43,"getting eliminated very early in the season, the lead up to her elimination is the usual",1264389.0,1271668.0

43,she is struggling with the performance. She's not doing a good job with her costume construction,1293639.0,1299248.0

43,They're mostly talking about her not being skilled as a drag queen. If you think about,1327309.0,1332288.0
43,it as a type of performing art in the same way that opera or ballet or river dancing,1332289.0,1338518.0

44,"either the /ə/ sound, the schwa sound itself, or /ɛɪ/, which in most languages the /ɛɪ/",696010.0,703609.0

44,"/kæfɛɪ/ or /foɹtɛɪ/, those Es are that /ɛɪ/ sound. This kind of explains to me",709630.0,717829.0
44,why it's an upside-down E and not an upside-down literally any other vowel because every vowel,717830.0,724649.0
44,letter can become a schwa sound because in this origin it could be used for either one,724650.0,728889.0
44,of these two sounds. L: Nifty. Even though it's pronounced /ʃva/,728890.0,732959.0
44,"in modern Hebrew, the spelling of 'schwa' itself is actually from the German spelling",732960.0,740139.0
44,for it. I think this was one of the reasons I like the name 'schwa' is that it encapsulates,740140.0,745299.0
44,"its history being borrowed from Hebrew orthography. Then, in the 19th Century, a lot of German",745300.0,751778.0
44,linguists used it for that sound. That S-C-H spelling is the German spelling rather than,751779.0,760409.0
44,"any other language. Most satisfyingly, it was first used by a guy called Schmeller who",760410.0,766659.0
44,"has his name spelt S-C-H as well. G: Johann Andreas Schmeller, who also used",766660.0,772739.0
44,the schwa. Maybe that's why he liked it. L: It became big in the 19th Century and definitely,772740.0,777699.0
44,by the end of the 19th Century/Early 20th Century it was being used in texts to represent,777700.0,783829.0
44,that sound. G: Schwa is also very common in German. A,783830.0,787689.0
44,lot of words that end in E in German have that E pronounced as a schwa. The name what,787690.0,792829.0
44,in English would be Gabe -- the German name /gaːbə/ -- that /ə/ at the end is also,792830.0,796329.0
44,a schwa. L: It definitely pops up in a lot of languages,796330.0,800159.0
44,because it's quite efficient. G: You also get this optional schwa sound,800160.0,803809.0
44,"with Es at the end of the word in French. You can have /lɔ̃ːg/ but also /lɔ̃ːgə/,",803810.0,808379.0

44,"When it is pronounced, it's pronounced kind of like schwa. This gets to something interesting",812490.0,817159.0

44,L: I'm really jealous that I never learnt that very efficient way of thinking about,867020.0,871359.0
44,what E was doing. G: But it's a rule that's kind of unsatisfying,871360.0,875909.0
44,to me as a linguist now because why should adding an extra vowel to the end of the word,875910.0,883208.0
44,change how the vowel in the middle of the word is being pronounced? That's something,883209.0,887489.0
44,that I found unsatisfying as a budding linguist. What sort of process is that?,887490.0,891759.0
44,"L: I am going -- I mean, I know the answer. But if I had not known the answer, I would've",891760.0,897318.0

44,"G: I mean, that's not not what's going on.",907110.0,911449.0
44,L: The reason why they had to retrospectively come up with this rule is because the E used,911450.0,919409.0
44,to be pronounced. It used to be pronounced as our friend schwa. They weren't just one,919410.0,925528.0
44,syllable words. The were two syllable words. It was /banə/ -- 'bane' -- and /famə/,925529.0,932349.0
44,"and /hamə/. G: Oh, so the schwa actually used to be pronounced",932350.0,937458.0

44,"Instead of 'home,' /hoʊmə/ or something like that.",944310.0,947409.0
44,"L: Yes. You had two syllables instead of one syllable that we have now for 'fine,'",947410.0,953549.0
44,"'fame,' 'home.' Those syllables started with a consonant, ended with a vowel. Then,",953550.0,960018.0
44,"over time, that schwa comes off at the end. It's not as easy to always pronounce it",960019.0,967559.0
44,"-- a bit like with the French example. In French at the moment, you can pronounce it,",967560.0,972069.0
44,or you don't have to. It's starting to erode away at the end of a word. That was,972070.0,976519.0
44,the process that happened in English. G: Right. This is really interesting because,976520.0,981069.0
44,in English and in other Germanic languages as well there's a difference between the,981070.0,985588.0
44,kinds of vowels that you can have in a syllable where there's a consonant at the end and,985589.0,991009.0
44,"in a syllable where there isn't. We have English words 'hid' and 'hide,' which",991010.0,996289.0
44,"have /ɪ/ and /ɑɪ/ in them both between H and D. But there's a word like 'hi,'",996290.0,1003599.0

44,of these can be perfectly good as long as there's another consonant in them.,1010630.0,1014209.0
44,L: This is where the rules of English syllables interact with the rules of what sounds can,1014210.0,1019518.0
44,"go into them. We used to have two syllables in words like 'fine' and 'fame,' and",1019519.0,1026539.0
44,now we have one. That little E sits there to remind us as a written fossil even though,1026540.0,1032558.0
44,we don't pronounce it anymore. G: It reminds us that the vowel that's in,1032559.0,1037198.0
44,"this first syllable, which is now the only syllable, is the kind that can exist without",1037199.0,1042779.0

44,"us -- and by 'us' I mean people who know this history, which is not most modern contemporary",1055240.0,1059829.0

44,"in open syllables. L: For the rest of us, it's just a handy",1065160.0,1067939.0
44,way to spell properly. G: There was a special reason why it was schwa,1067940.0,1072589.0
44,that was so easily lost at the end of all of these words like 'fine' and 'home',1072590.0,1078529.0
44,and 'hide.' That's because schwa is what's known as a 'reduced vowel.' It's,1078530.0,1083859.0
44,physically produced for a shorter amount of time than a full vowel like /ɑɪ/ or /i/,1083860.0,1089559.0
44,or even /ɪ/. L: It's what allows us to just sneak it,1089560.0,1092619.0
44,in really quickly in syllables that we're not really focusing on.,1092620.0,1096699.0
44,"G: If we produce some syllables faster or quieter than other ones, those faster or quieter",1096700.0,1103199.0
44,symbols tend to also have schwas. L: This is why schwa crops up in all of these,1103200.0,1110889.0
44,words regardless of what vowel they're spelt with. I'm pretty sure Lauren who really,1110890.0,1116429.0
44,struggled to spell words because she couldn't distinguish the vowel because it was being,1116430.0,1120969.0
44,"pronounced with schwa when she was learning to spell would've said, 'Why don't we",1120970.0,1126489.0
44,just spell all the words with schwa and be done with it?' That wouldn't be the most,1126490.0,1131379.0
44,"practical solution. G: The problem is, if we respell English to",1131380.0,1135269.0
44,"be consistent and every time we say schwa we write schwa, it works in the short term",1135270.0,1139629.0
44,"because we have this transparent relationship between the sound and spelling, which is nice.",1139630.0,1143969.0
44,But the annoying thing -- this fact that you can write any English vowel letter for,1143970.0,1149808.0
44,the sound schwa -- is also a fact about the structure of English. There are all these,1149809.0,1155079.0
44,words that are related to each other where we can see that relationship more clearly,1155080.0,1159459.0
44,based on the spelling than we can sometimes with the pronunciation. The spelling can help,1159460.0,1164099.0
44,us notice when words are related to each other. If we take up a word pair like 'acid',1164100.0,1168949.0
44,"and 'acidity' -- L: 'Acid' and 'acidity.' Well, that",1168950.0,1173500.0
44,-ity bit on the end of 'acid' that turns it into 'acidity' also changes the vowel,1173501.0,1179729.0
44,to a schwa. G: Yeah. /æsɪd/ and /əsɪdəti/ -- in,1179730.0,1187009.0
44,"the first one we have /æ/ as the first vowel and in the second one we have /ə/. Yet, it",1187010.0,1192469.0
44,still seems pretty intuitive that these words are related to each other. It's just that,1192470.0,1196569.0
44,"when we do have this -ity on the end, we pronounce the main word -- instead of /æsɪd/, we",1196570.0,1202190.0

44,"turn to lose the relationship between, say, 'courage' and 'courageous' just because",1206070.0,1211049.0
44,we have that -ous on the end of 'courageous.' G: It's the same thing there. /kʌɹəd͡ʒ/,1211050.0,1218408.0
44,"-- the second syllable -age, there's a schwa. But /kʌɹɛɪd͡ʒəs/ -- now there's",1218409.0,1222959.0
44,"a different vowel there. It's just because we've added the -ous on the end. Yet, it's",1222960.0,1228269.0
44,nice that these two words that are very clearly related to each other still look the same.,1228270.0,1232279.0
44,L: I guess it's particularly true as well of those word pairs in English that only differ,1232280.0,1237629.0
44,because of stress. Like /ˈɹɛˌkəɹd/ and /ˌɹəˈkoɹd/ -- only different because,1237630.0,1243489.0
44,"of stress. Then, we'd be spelling them differently because each one has a schwa in the opposite",1243490.0,1249109.0

44,say. Swap the schwas. You wouldn't know what vowel to recover from the syllable once,1263549.0,1272678.0
44,you started stressing it. It's the same thing with -ity and -ous. When you make 'acid',1272679.0,1277529.0

44,of which word is stressed -- that's also a very English thing. I find the most interesting,1451870.0,1457009.0
44,place to notice how important stress is in English is when it comes to poetry.,1457010.0,1461639.0

45,Latin and 'father' in English and 'pitar' in Sanskrit and 'Vater' in German. You,416810.0,423399.0

45,"T. You have 'padre' in Spanish. You're like, 'Uh, D, that's not that different",432150.0,436969.0
45,from a T.' Maybe there was an ancestor language that had a word like this for 'father',436970.0,442179.0
45,"that also had a T in the middle. Or if you have 'pater' from Latin with a P, and",442180.0,448039.0
45,"Sanskrit both have a P, and German has a V, and English has an F, you can be like, okay,",448040.0,453289.0
45,"well, we have two Ps -- well, several Ps -- and a couple Fs and Vs. Maybe there was",453290.0,459869.0
45,"one of these, especially the P because Latin and Sanskrit are spoken pretty far apart -- German",459870.0,465589.0
45,"and English are spoken pretty close together, just geographically -- so maybe the ancestor",465590.0,469449.0
45,"language had a P there as well. You can do that comparison at this very, very nitty gritty",469450.0,475059.0
45,"level for a whole bunch of individual words and figure out which sounds change. Again,",475060.0,481168.0
45,"if you see P changing to F from Latin to English in 'father,' you should also see P changing",481169.0,486918.0
45,"to F in other words. The Latin word 'pes, pedes,' meaning 'foot,' it's cognate",486919.0,493289.0
45,"with foot because, again, there's that P to F change. Well, German is 'Fuß,' which",493290.0,498739.0
45,"isn't a V, so, again, you have to account for this. You can go through and make these",498740.0,504239.0
45,"very elaborate tables with cross comparisons. L: My favourite historical sound change comparison,",504240.0,511759.0

45,"-- which is, again, there's your H -- my favourite example of the specific /k/ to /h/",561279.0,566239.0

45,"L: It's right there. G: That 'cornu-' at the beginning of 'cornucopia,'",569689.0,572759.0
45,"that's a horn! And the '-orn' part, 'corn' and 'horn,' you really see",572760.0,578489.0
45,a lot of similarities because the rest of the sounds in those words haven't changed,578490.0,581229.0
45,as much. L: The nice thing about 'cornucopia' is,581230.0,584028.0
45,that we borrowed 'copious' from Latin to mean 'a lot.' Because it wasn't just,584029.0,589438.0
45,"a word that stayed in English and had the systematic sound change, we didn't borrow",589439.0,593249.0
45,it as 'hopious.' We just borrowed it with the Latin sound. That's the difference between,593250.0,598948.0
45,words that are borrowed and words that are related.,598949.0,601558.0
45,G: The neat thing about doing this comparative reconstruction is that you need to figure,601559.0,606448.0
45,"out, okay, first of all, what do we know about the history of this word? Because the word",606449.0,610659.0
45,'copious' in English isn't gonna give us evidence for what was going on in the ancestor,610660.0,615928.0
45,language of the Germanic languages because we know that it was borrowed from Latin much,615929.0,618979.0

45,the comparison only with that bit of core vocabulary that did have all of the sound,623730.0,629489.0
45,"changes happen to it. The fun thing is that, as an English speaker, because we've borrowed",629490.0,632998.0
45,"so many words from other European languages at various times, is that we can often see",632999.0,637919.0
45,"these sound changes happen even within English. Even if you don't speak Latin, you can be",637920.0,642128.0
45,"like, 'Oh, I know the word 'cornucopia.'' You can see this happen within English as",642129.0,646469.0
45,well because we've borrowed words at different time depths.,646470.0,649688.0
45,"L: One thing I'm always blown away with, with historical linguistics doing this comparison",649689.0,655859.0

45,to the language. For every sound rule there's always these sub-rule exceptions because in,666259.0,673799.0
45,front of some verb something doesn't happen. It's this meticulous work. As computers,673800.0,680549.0
45,"have become more advanced, the scale of the work has expanded so much because you can",680550.0,685738.0
45,crunch more data. There's very large spreadsheets and tables that happen to build these reconstructions.,685739.0,693558.0

45,G: Writing is so new. It's so interesting to look back at this part before written records,710589.0,718099.0
45,exist. This is why people call them proto-languages. Any language that's preceded by a 'proto',718100.0,722838.0
45,"is something that's been reconstructed. Sometimes, you get Old English. We have records",722839.0,727018.0

45,that because we don't have any sort of written records and it's been figured out in that,730829.0,734939.0
45,sort of way. I think what I really love about historical linguistics is the way that it,734940.0,739849.0
45,pays attention -- the people who do it -- pay such close attention to what's attested,739850.0,744878.0
45,and what's reconstructed and the sources of information. There's this convention,744879.0,749609.0
45,in historical linguistics to write an asterisk before proto-words. This confused me coming,749610.0,757258.0
45,"from the rest of linguistics because in the rest of linguistics, you put an asterisk before",757259.0,762458.0
45,a word or sentence that's not grammatical. L: Or like in my instant message chat where,762459.0,767558.0
45,I frequently have to use an asterisk because I misspelt a word and need to correct it.,767559.0,772488.0
45,"G: Well, okay, there's that too. I think that is a bit later of a usage than the linguistic",772489.0,778328.0

45,"This is like 'horn plenty of' or something like that, which you wouldn't say those",784009.0,787989.0
45,words in that order. Historical linguists use that asterisk as a reminder to themselves,787990.0,793789.0

45,"it to any other proto-language that's been reconstructed, you're now making guesses",849359.0,854318.0
45,out of two guesses which becomes very slippery. G: It's like if you have one number that's,854319.0,862258.0
45,"fairly uncertain that's got a margin of error -- you know, plus or minus 5% -- and",862259.0,865679.0

47,like to think of them as 'adje-verbs' and 'adje-nouns.' You have your adjectives,1440549.0,1444308.0
47,that work like verbs do and your adjectives that work like nouns do. This is true of Algonquian,1444309.0,1449939.0

47,"Instead of saying, 'This house is big,' you say, essentially, 'The house bigs'",1455710.0,1460148.0

47,the Manange which are kind of verb-y. G: Yeah. They conjugate like verbs. The verbs,1468279.0,1472739.0
47,"get different types of endings and so on. They really act like verbs. Whereas, the nouns",1472740.0,1476558.0

47,the idea that adjectives exist. You can find evidence in English that they're distinct,1481970.0,1487099.0

47,"which of course is biased towards which languages have been previously described, but it does",1518730.0,1523369.0
47,give you a bit of a picture of what some languages do at least. They actually break down five,1523370.0,1529638.0
47,"different types of ways you could treat adjectives. L: Okay. Here are five common ways, if we",1529639.0,1536148.0
47,"look across the world's languages, adjectives tend to exist.",1536149.0,1540599.0
47,G: Right. They call them 'property concepts' because it's not clear that all of them,1540600.0,1544979.0
47,are actually adjectives. L: Okay.,1544980.0,1546959.0
47,G: We've talked about three of them already. One is property concepts could be verbs. The,1546960.0,1551579.0
47,second is property concepts could be nouns. The fifth is there's a distinct class of,1551580.0,1556069.0
47,adjectives for property concepts. L: I love that's the fifth. The thing that,1556070.0,1559668.0
47,"we think of as the most obvious is like, 'Oh, and also this thing.'",1559669.0,1563678.0
47,G: The other two are -- sometimes property concepts are treated as nouns and sometimes,1563679.0,1569849.0
47,they're treated as verbs depending on the demands of discourse. The example that this,1569850.0,1574668.0
47,"book has is in Dutch, but I'm more familiar with the German case which works in the same",1574669.0,1577829.0
47,"way, I think. This was one of those weird facts you have to learn about German adjectives",1577830.0,1582009.0
47,if you learn German adjectives in school. Thy way that they articulate it in this book,1582010.0,1586248.0
47,"was not the way that I had learned this. It was just like, 'Here's this class of adjectives",1586249.0,1590209.0
47,and it does several different weird things.' It's very cool when you think about it in,1590210.0,1594229.0
47,"this way, which is that when the adjective goes before the noun -- if you have something",1594230.0,1600069.0
47,"like 'a red cat,' 'a red car,' which is 'eine rote Katze,' 'ein rotes Auto.'",1600070.0,1606038.0
47,"'A red balloon' -- 'ein roter Ballon.' In that case, the adjective, 'red,' has",1606039.0,1610839.0
47,a different form depending on which noun it goes with. It acts like a noun because it,1610840.0,1614859.0
47,"gets all these noun endings depending on the gender. But if you say, 'The cat is red,'",1614860.0,1619908.0
47,"'The car is red,' 'The balloon is red' -- 'Das Auto ist rote.' You don't put",1619909.0,1624469.0
47,"the ending there. You just have the bare form of the adjective. In that sense, it's acting",1624470.0,1630449.0
47,more verb-like because it doesn't do the same gender agreement that it does when it's,1630450.0,1635158.0
47,"before the noun. This was taught to me as like, 'Here's this thing you have to memorise,'",1635159.0,1640128.0
47,but to think about it in terms of a typological perspective of maybe adjectives are fake and,1640129.0,1645829.0
47,these words are sometimes acting as nouns and sometimes acting as verbs depending on,1645830.0,1649508.0
47,"other things in the discourse, it's just a really interesting proposal. German speakers",1649509.0,1653689.0
47,"probably think that they have adjectives, but it's an interesting formal proposal.",1653690.0,1657648.0
47,L: I like it as a way to re-think something you take for granted.,1657649.0,1662439.0
47,G: Because it is true that sometimes they really seem to be very noun-y and they get,1662440.0,1665939.0
47,"these endings that the nouns get. Sometimes, they don't get these endings. There's",1665940.0,1670168.0
47,also an extent to which they don't really act like verbs because verbs get endings depending,1670169.0,1673889.0
47,"on what -- if they were being really verb-y, you should have like, 'You 'red,''",1673890.0,1678628.0
47,"'Du 'rotest,'' which that doesn't -- 'Du 'rotst'' -- that doesn't",1678629.0,1682368.0
47,"exist. They don't act fully like verbs, but they could act in the same way that you",1682369.0,1686579.0
47,"can say, 'This is open,' 'This is closed,' 'This is opened,' 'It is closed.'",1686580.0,1690469.0
47,It could be some sort of verbal participle thingy. I dunno. It's an interesting way,1690470.0,1694489.0
47,"of pointing out that even the diagnostics that say, 'It takes on morphosyntactic properties",1694490.0,1699868.0
47,"of one type of part of speech, therefore it must belong to the same category as that part",1699869.0,1704008.0
47,"of speech.' If you have a case where sometimes it has the same endings and sometimes it doesn't,",1704009.0,1708439.0
47,then there are two things going on. L: Hmm. You've talked about four out of,1708440.0,1712349.0
47,five possibilities for how things we think of as adjectives occur across the world's,1712350.0,1717969.0
47,languages. What is the fifth? G: The fifth one is also a part-time thing,1717970.0,1722729.0
47,which is that some property concepts get treated as nouns and other ones get treated as verbs.,1722730.0,1727508.0
47,"L: Right. So, kind of the opposite. G: Right.",1727509.0,1730538.0
47,L: Okay. This is our Manange example where you have that very small set that act as adjectives,1730539.0,1737138.0
47,in a particular way and you have a set that act as more verb-y adjectives.,1737139.0,1741918.0
47,G: Yeah. For example -- and I don't know if this is true of a particular language -- you,1741919.0,1745759.0
47,"could say, maybe, colours and numbers in this language get treated as verbs but sizes and",1745760.0,1752219.0
47,qualities get treated as nouns or vice versa or some sort of distinction like that. The,1752220.0,1758558.0
47,"example in this book is with Yoruba, and I don't know enough Yoruba to have a concrete",1758559.0,1762278.0
47,example of how that works. L: It does exist in real languages. That's,1762279.0,1766579.0
47,"good enough evidence for me. G: It kind of takes us to this question which,",1766580.0,1772329.0
47,"you know, is also a question, if we look back at the Latin based or Greek based -- because",1772330.0,1776808.0
47,"Greek did the same thing as Latin where it lumped nouns and adjectives together for,",1776809.0,1780168.0
47,"again, really good language internal reasons that they had the same sets of endings -- of,",1780169.0,1785668.0
47,is the class of adjectives even valid? Is it even really a thing when you start looking,1785669.0,1790629.0
47,"at the different types of evidence for a distinct class of words, in this case, across different",1790630.0,1796798.0
47,languages? L: This brings us back to that question of,1796799.0,1799758.0
47,those diagnostic criteria and the ways of testing if something is an adjective or maybe,1799759.0,1805469.0
47,a noun or a verb that we talked about in more detail for English and a little bit of detail,1805470.0,1810499.0
47,for other languages which is that you need to figure out the criteria that you're using,1810500.0,1815788.0
47,for diagnosis in each language. You can't just come in with the English criteria and,1815789.0,1821579.0
47,try and apply them to Yoruba or Manange or French because it won't work.,1821580.0,1826768.0

47,"'Here are the diagnostic criteria for adjectives' and if you're gonna work in English, it's",1831049.0,1835248.0

47,words are in each of these categories yet.' L: Yes. I remember doing this for Yolmo. There's,1862400.0,1868168.0
47,a bit of flexibility about whether an adjective can go before a noun or after a noun. They,1868169.0,1873859.0
47,"seem to mostly go before, I think, but I never actually -- with the data that I had -- managed",1873860.0,1881148.0

48,Linguistics is out this month -- the beginning of the 16-part introduction to linguistics,30910.0,37759.0
48,through the Crash Course YouTube Channel. We'll have a link to their channel in the,37760.0,42768.0

48,"[Music] L: Today, I'm joined by Shivonne Gates who",59640.0,71329.0
48,is a Senior Researcher at NatCen Social Research. Shivonne has a background in linguistics as,71330.0,77889.0
48,well as sociology and applied social research. Her linguistics research interests include,77890.0,84189.0
48,"language and ethnicity, sociolinguistics, and critical race theory. Welcome, Shivonne.",84190.0,88809.0
48,"S: Hi, Lauren! Thanks for having me. L: It is absolutely a delight to have you",88810.0,94469.0
48,here today. Can you tell us a bit about how you got into linguistics?,94470.0,99169.0
48,"S: Sure. I actually got into linguistics when I was in sixth form, which is the last two",99170.0,105849.0
48,"years of high school in the UK. I did A level English language. As part of that, I did a",105850.0,114009.0
48,mini research project. L: Cool!,114010.0,115819.0
48,"S: Yeah, it was really cool. I did some narrative analysis of a couple of recordings of my cousin",115820.0,123139.0
48,"at different developmental stages. He was, I think, something like 5 and 9. I compared",123140.0,130219.0
48,"how his narrative structures had developed over time, essentially.",130220.0,134269.0
48,"L: Cool. Had you happened to just record him as a 5-year-old because he was cute, or were",134270.0,142159.0
48,you thinking that you had plans to analyse his language?,142160.0,146329.0
48,"S: Neither. His family just did lots of home videos, and something he liked to do for himself",146330.0,152229.0
48,was just stand in front of the camera and record himself telling stories.,152230.0,155649.0
48,"L: Oh, how wonderful. S: I got him to do another one at the time",155650.0,159399.0
48,that was kind of so many years later. That was the one I asked him to do. It was just,159400.0,164208.0
48,"a stroke of luck that that data existed, essentially. I was really interested in child language",164209.0,168939.0
48,"acquisition. But also, as I think a lot of people are, I was also just interested in",168940.0,173439.0
48,accents and the different ways that people spoke and understanding why that was and what,173440.0,177930.0
48,"kind of social things drove that. Then, I studied linguistics as an undergrad and then",177931.0,183219.0
48,went on to master's and PhD after that. L: Did you know from studying English language,183220.0,188399.0
48,that linguistics was a thing that existed? Was it on your radar and you sought it out?,188400.0,193958.0
48,"Or did you get to university and go, 'Ah, here's the thing I wanted to do'?",193959.0,198449.0
48,"S: So, something in the middle. I knew I really enjoying doing that research project, for",198450.0,202959.0
48,"example, in school. I didn't know what I wanted to study at university, so I spoke",202960.0,208208.0
48,"to my English teacher. She asked me what I enjoyed, and I told her the specific bits",208209.0,213738.0
48,"of our English course I liked. And she said, 'Oh, well, you should look for a university",213739.0,217769.0
48,course that includes linguistics.' I had that steer from her to look for English language,217770.0,222749.0
48,"and linguistics undergrads. I ended up at the University of Sheffield and really, really",222750.0,227949.0
48,loved it because there was a lot of flexibility in what we were able to study. I was able,227950.0,232019.0
48,"to really tailor in terms of what I studied, which I really enjoyed.",232020.0,235729.0
48,"L: You managed to do a little bit of research in your high school subject, which is really",235730.0,241149.0
48,"cool. Is there, for you, a coherent narrative line between that and then going on to your",241150.0,248659.0
48,PhD research? S: Not particularly beyond that that was linguistics.,248660.0,255419.0
48,I honestly didn't see that as research at the time. I did think I really fully understood,255420.0,259578.0
48,what that was. I only started to understand that university lecturers do research -- I,259579.0,266559.0
48,only got that insight because I got a job as an RA for one summer in my penultimate,266560.0,272329.0
48,summer. I think all of that only really came through towards the end of my undergrad and,272330.0,277579.0
48,then through my master's. L: What did you do for your summer research,277580.0,281848.0
48,"position? S: I worked on Emma's Isle of Scilly project,",281849.0,285739.0
48,which the Isles of Scilly are a group of islands off the southwest coast of England. They're,285740.0,292068.0
48,about 30 miles off the very bottom corner off the coast of Cornwall. They're quite,292069.0,298199.0
48,isolated because of that. Emma has gone on holiday there for years. She discovered an,298200.0,304359.0
48,"archive of video interviews and, as a linguist, had some thoughts about the local dialect",304360.0,311028.0
48,"and wanted to explore a bit more. When she found this archive, it was like, 'Jackpot",311029.0,315579.0
48,"-- I've got all this data!' My role was to help do all the data management for that,",315580.0,322218.0
48,"essentially -- transcribing and archiving the data. Then, because I'd had that involvement",322219.0,326748.0
48,"with the data, at that point, I was then able to write my undergrad dissertation on some",326749.0,330579.0
48,of the data. That was really cool. L: Amazing! I love the theme with your high,330580.0,336549.0
48,school work of finding existing recordings and using them strategically. I think that's,336550.0,343339.0
48,a really nice thing that a lot of us can learn from using data that's already out there,343340.0,349918.0
48,"in the world. S: Yeah, definitely. I hadn't even picked",349919.0,353118.0
48,"up on that until you just pointed it out, actually. But, yeah, I mean, especially as",353119.0,356779.0
48,"an undergrad, it took a lot of stress out of the dissertation because I didn't have",356780.0,360330.0
48,to do the data collection. I already had it. It absolutely makes sense to do things like,360331.0,364089.0
48,that when we can. L: And what makes this dialect so distinct?,364090.0,368549.0
48,S: I think the reason it's interesting is because there's not been a lot of research,368550.0,372829.0
48,"about it but the stuff that has been written, essentially, just kind of lumped it together",372830.0,376709.0
48,"with Cornwall. But as we see quite often with island communities, it's a lot more insular",376710.0,383138.0
48,than Cornwall. You get the thing that you see quite often -- I think Martha's Vineyard,383139.0,387429.0
48,is a classic example -- of somewhere touristy that young people then leave and don't want,387430.0,391759.0
48,to go back to. You get a traditional older people living -- who work in the tourist,391760.0,397758.0
48,"industry. Then, on the Isles of Scilly, you also get a lot of more wealthy people going",397759.0,401128.0
48,there to retire and having holiday homes there and stuff like that. The thing that I looked,401129.0,406468.0
48,at for my undergrad dissertation was the stylistic variation because their video archive had,406469.0,410508.0
48,"two different interviewers. There was a local person who'd done some interviews, but then",410509.0,414388.0
48,also somebody who had moved there later in life did some interviews as well. I looked,414389.0,418119.0
48,at the differences with a couple of speakers in how they interacted with those two different,418120.0,423209.0
48,interviewers. There are definitely differences from Cornish English for sure. The vowel space,423210.0,429618.0
48,"looks slightly different. I can't -- honestly, it's so long ago since I looked at that",429619.0,435218.0
48,"I can't remember the details. But, yeah, there were definitely differences in terms",435219.0,437918.0
48,of pronunciation as well as grammatical stuff. Emma's done a lot of work on it since then.,437919.0,442848.0
48,"L: I assume that when people were chatting to the more local interviewer, they tended",442849.0,448398.0
48,to be even more strongly local in their pronunciation and their word choices. Did that come through?,448399.0,455709.0
48,"S: Yeah, exactly. I remember one of them, it was almost like he was a different person",455710.0,460359.0
48,"with the local interviewer. He was a lot more talkative and, for me, a lot more difficult",460360.0,465978.0
48,to understand because his accent was pretty broad. They're also rhotic in that part,465979.0,470959.0
48,"of the country, which isn't that typical of the rest England. That threw me for a loop",470960.0,477498.0
48,"to get my ears into listening to that dialect. L: It is something that, in terms of the methodology",477499.0,485348.0
48,"for how people collect data, deciding who was going to be the person that goes into",485349.0,490019.0
48,that space and does that data collection is going to really influence how people speak,490020.0,495098.0
48,"and the type of data you collect. You've had to, I know, kind of think about this really",495099.0,499999.0
48,critically and come up with some innovative ways in your own later research when you started,500000.0,505068.0
48,to collect data as well -- how to navigate that.,505069.0,508418.0
48,"S: Yeah. I think it's something that, as linguists, quite often we know that that's",508419.0,512139.0
48,"there and that's an important thing to consider. But sometimes it's almost like, well, if",512140.0,517800.0
48,"we acknowledge, it then that's enough. I don't think we are always as critical of",517801.0,521489.0
48,that as we could be -- or critical in acknowledging how that shapes the findings that we get.,521490.0,529499.0
48,L: All of this experience led you to then -- did you go into a master's or did you,529500.0,535099.0
48,go into a PhD programme? S: I went into a master's program. I did,535100.0,539219.0
48,a master's degree at North Carolina State University. That experience was really affirming,539220.0,546019.0
48,in terms of that I want to be a linguist and also really eye-opening in terms of different,546020.0,552069.0
48,"ways of being a linguist, like doing more impact-related stuff -- I hate the way that",552070.0,557349.0
48,"'impact,' I think, is a really kind of UK higher education buzzword.",557350.0,560199.0
48,L: Definitely. S: But basically doing more public-facing,560200.0,564159.0
48,linguistics and doing linguistics that is for and serves the communities that you're,564160.0,569069.0
48,collecting data from. I really enjoyed that experience. It was a two-year master's as,569070.0,573299.0
48,"well, which I think if you're gonna do a master's -- a one-year master's is typical",573300.0,576849.0
48,of a UK master's. L: It's a 'Blink and it's over' situation.,576850.0,580869.0
48,"S: It's just not enough. And, yeah, because it was two years, I was able to spend the",580870.0,585159.0
48,first year properly getting more closely into sociolinguistics specifically. And then in,585160.0,592559.0
48,my second year I had the time to actually develop a research project in a way that I,592560.0,597259.0
48,think you don't necessarily have the time to do if you do a one-year master's. It's,597260.0,600979.0
48,"all like a big rush in the summer. And, you know, I got into conferencing and doing all",600980.0,605169.0
48,that other I find fun academic related stuff as well because we had the time to do that.,605170.0,610699.0
48,"Yeah, I really enjoyed my time there. Then, I went straight from the master's to the",610700.0,615719.0
48,"PhD. At that point, when I did my master's, I was like, 'I know I want to do a PhD.'",615720.0,619909.0
48,I ended up at Queen Mary University for that. L: Did you have an idea when you went into,619910.0,624879.0
48,the PhD program what you wanted to work on? How did you come to decide on your area of,624880.0,631869.0
48,focus? S: Throughout all of my undergrad research,631870.0,635259.0
48,project and my master's research project what I was really interested in stylistic,635260.0,638509.0
48,"variation. We all, I think, are aware that -- even if we're not linguists -- we're",638510.0,644909.0
48,"aware that we'll talk differently to different people, or we have a job interview voice,",644910.0,648639.0
48,"or a telephone voice, and all those types of things. I found that stuff really interesting.",648640.0,654109.0
48,I think when I was doing master's Sarah Benor's paper on ethnolinguistic repertoires,654110.0,659559.0
48,came out. Devyani Sharma had also published some stuff recently about stylistic variation,659560.0,666709.0
48,"in a British Asian community in London. It was just, for me, a really hot topic and something",666710.0,673699.0
48,that I was really interested in -- how people moved it forward using different methodologies,673700.0,678879.0
48,"and trying to really unpick stylistic variation as it happens on an everyday basis, rather",678880.0,685859.0
48,"than the traditional Labovian approach is to look at, you know, 'Oh, let's have",685860.0,690580.0
48,"a reading list, and we'll compare that to spontaneous interview speech.' But, of course,",690581.0,695469.0
48,those are quite artificial speech contexts. It's not the same as how we're interacting,695470.0,700429.0
48,on a daily basis. I was really interested in the fact that things were moving towards,700430.0,705099.0
48,getting into more detail about that. That's what I did my master's project on. I got,705100.0,709369.0
48,"some self-recorded data and looked at stylistic variation in that. My PhD project, I initially",709370.0,715709.0
48,proposed to do the same in London with adolescents. I was also really interested in some recent,715710.0,721419.0
48,"work that had come out about Multicultural London English, which is this variety of English",721420.0,726069.0
48,in London that has emerged over the last 20 years. Jenny Cheshire and Paul Kerswell and,726070.0,731339.0
48,team had been publishing on that. I think at that point there'd only been two or three,731340.0,735819.0
48,publications. It was all quite new still. I was interested in bringing those two things,735820.0,740840.0
48,together -- finding out more about Multicultural London English but looking at stylistic variation,740841.0,745879.0
48,using more novel methods for doing that in London.,745880.0,749379.0
48,L: I think it's worth flagging for people who aren't familiar with the UK context,749380.0,753919.0
48,just how different London is but also is perceived to be from the rest of the country. This is,753920.0,764909.0
48,"mostly my outsider-who-came-and-lived-there-for-a-couple-of-years view, but it seems -- I mean, London does",764910.0,772539.0
48,just have a lot more linguistic and ethnic diversity than many other places in the UK.,772540.0,778229.0
48,There's also this idea for many people mentally that if you're a Londoner you may not visit,778230.0,785429.0
48,other parts of the country very much. It has a mental state a bit like people talk about,785430.0,790529.0
48,"New York or something. So, the linguistic context of what's happening in London is",790530.0,795929.0
48,very specific to the ethic and social and economic dynamics of that particular part,795930.0,801719.0
48,"of the country. S: Absolutely. It's a real economic hub,",801720.0,806319.0
48,"isn't it, London, in the UK. Post-PhD, that's why I stayed in London because that's where",806320.0,811279.0
48,"the jobs are. Things like, I think -- these figures are not precise but just as a rough",811280.0,818149.0
48,"idea -- I think something like the percentage of black Britons in the UK is 2% or 3%, but",818150.0,824699.0
48,"then in London it's like 13%. It's really, really quite different. Comparing even with",824700.0,829778.0
48,"other cities, it's just a really unique social context in London compared to the rest",829779.0,835739.0
48,of England and the UK. L: That's the London part of London Multicultural,835740.0,841589.0
48,English. I don't think I've ever really interrogated what the 'multicultural',841590.0,847759.0
48,is doing in that name. Is there an assumption that it's a particular set of cultural groups,847760.0,856129.0
48,who have come together to form this variety? S: This is my interpretation. I think to really,856130.0,863569.0
48,get a proper answer about why it was given that name you'd have to go to Jenny and,863570.0,868379.0
48,Paul who decided that's the label they wanted to give. I also think it's important to,868380.0,874869.0
48,say I think they recognise that it's an imperfect label. But I think the idea behind,874870.0,879069.0
48,"it was essentially, when they were first observing language change in London and doing their",879070.0,884549.0
48,"data collection, I think there was an expectation that there might be some differences between",884550.0,891349.0
48,speakers depending on their ethnic or cultural background because London has so much -- it's,891350.0,898529.0
48,"ethnically diverse, but there's a lot of people moving into London as well as people",898530.0,903429.0
48,whose parents or grandparents were immigrants. There's also a lot of ongoing in-migration,903430.0,909249.0
48,into London of people from all over the place. Other cities in the UK will have a lot of,909250.0,916539.0
48,"immigrants from Poland or that -- but London, people are coming from everywhere. So, I think,",916540.0,923019.0
48,"essentially, what they found was that language had shifted amongst working class young people",923020.0,929379.0
48,"in London, but there weren't significant differences between the young people because",929380.0,934849.0
48,"of their background, it was because of who they were friends with -- so peer social",934850.0,939099.0
48,"networks. The young people with the more ethnically diverse social groups, they were the ones",939100.0,945919.0
48,who used the linguistic features of Multicultural London English. That included white British,945920.0,950659.0
48,young people in London -- or adolescents. I think the intention of that label is to,950660.0,956319.0
48,essentially say you can't predict who is going to speak this way based off of the more,956320.0,962489.0
48,traditional social categories that we use in linguistics. The young people were predominantly,962490.0,968849.0
48,"working class, and they predominantly lived in inner-city London. But in terms of ethnicity",968850.0,973929.0
48,"or culture or other languages spoken or anything like that, none of that stuff predicted. It",973930.0,979559.0
48,"was the diversity of their peer group networks. L: Right. It is worth flagging as well, one",979560.0,985829.0
48,thing that that I really noticed in the UK is obviously race and ethnicity and cultural,985830.0,992209.0
48,"background are something that people are very aware of and talk about a lot, but this idea",992210.0,996679.0
48,of class and working class is very engrained in the British mentality as well in a way,996680.0,1002349.0
48,that -- Australians are very desperate to believe that we are some kind of egalitarian,1002350.0,1007089.0
48,"society. If you speak to any Australian, they'll say they're middle class. Whereas, in Britain,",1007090.0,1013459.0
48,everyone seemed quite okay with pointing out who was working class and who was middle class,1013460.0,1018849.0
48,and who was posh. You had all these social markers about where you went on holiday and,1018850.0,1025869.0
48,what supermarket you shopped at were meant to give insights into this structure of class.,1025870.0,1031288.0
48,"I found that really different to how Australians perceive themselves, and I think it also feeds",1031289.0,1037818.0
48,into people's language choices. S: I think the key thing that's really different,1037819.0,1042029.0
48,about the UK context compared to Australia and also America is that people who identify,1042030.0,1046798.0
48,as working class are proud of that. There's no shame about being working class. That's,1046799.0,1052118.0
48,"not to say some people don't feel ashamed. Some people want to be socially upwardly mobile,",1052119.0,1056709.0

48,"working class and identify as working class, all the cultural things that come with that,",1059840.0,1065168.0
48,"they're important, and they're valuable, and they're proud of those things. I don't",1065169.0,1069399.0
48,see those same dynamics coming out in other western English-speaking countries. I think,1069400.0,1075668.0
48,you might have that -- using America as an example -- you might have it in a specific,1075669.0,1078689.0
48,"city or specific town or within a state, for example, but there's not this more unified",1078690.0,1084118.0
48,across the country sense of being working class is something you can be proud of. I,1084119.0,1088529.0
48,think you do have that in the UK. It's definitely different.,1088530.0,1092808.0
48,L: You have to pay attention in this complex social environment to all of these factors,1092809.0,1099498.0

48,"social network. Of course, you looked at an environment where social networks are -- maybe",1105119.0,1109898.0
48,the most important place in the world for social networks. You went and looked at people,1109899.0,1115648.0
48,and their language and their social dynamics in high school.,1115649.0,1119899.0
48,S: Yeah. I love teenagers. I think teenagers are fascinating. I think they're great and,1119900.0,1126359.0
48,"interesting people. I think that quite often because it's such a quick transitional time,",1126360.0,1131849.0

48,lot of their identity forming and figuring out who they are. I thought it would be a,1143440.0,1148739.0
48,really interesting way to get a bit more insight about how all of that works for these young,1148740.0,1154849.0
48,"people. As I said before, I was interested in looking at stylistic variation. I went",1154850.0,1160569.0
48,"into it with the assumption that these young people, because they lived in an inner-city",1160570.0,1164528.0

48,"unethical. You're not persuading people, pressuring people, into doing research. But",1180940.0,1185538.0
48,essentially presenting to them the value of engaging with the research was definitely,1185539.0,1192689.0
48,challenging. My intended approach to collect data on stylistic variation was not feasible.,1192690.0,1198459.0
48,"I wanted to do self-recording. I was doing interviews with them, but I wanted them to",1198460.0,1202768.0

48,really difficult. L: But your genius data collection plans were,1225970.0,1229109.0
48,thwarted by teenagers. S: Essentially. But that's the nature of,1229110.0,1233329.0
48,"doing research, isn't it? You've just gotta roll with it when things come up that",1233330.0,1236939.0
48,"you don't expect. I did traditional sociolinguistic interviews, and I was also doing ethnographic",1236940.0,1243488.0

48,ethnic identity as being something that would be overly salient for these young people.,1258409.0,1264418.0

48,Everything was super gendered. The girls hung out with the girls. The boys hung out with,1299010.0,1302498.0
48,the boys. They had their different areas in the yard outside where they would go at their,1302499.0,1306768.0
48,breaktimes or recess or whatever you call it. They had very typical gendered social,1306769.0,1312178.0

48,"and gossip and do their ma -- you know, all of that stuff was all just like when I was",1315530.0,1319439.0
48,"in school. It's not changed. However, there were all of these little nuances to how they",1319440.0,1326619.0
48,"presented themselves which, for me, a lot of it was grounded in asserting their ethnic",1326620.0,1332118.0
48,identity. Part of why I'm able to say that so confidently is because that's what they,1332119.0,1337908.0
48,"called themselves -- their peer groups, the girl peer groups. There was the black squad.",1337909.0,1342038.0
48,There was the Asian squad. There was the white squad. And then there was the Skittle squad,1342039.0,1347969.0
48,because they were all different colours. They rebranded themselves after I'd been there,1347970.0,1352048.0
48,for about a term -- the main squad -- because they wanted to assert themselves as the popular,1352049.0,1357319.0
48,"ones. But, yeah, I mean, just the fact that those were the labels -- and they weren't",1357320.0,1361079.0
48,throwaway labels. That's how they referred to each other across peer groups as well.,1361080.0,1367008.0

48,"what they're actually calling themselves? Then, you know, there's the hair styles.",1370279.0,1374138.0
48,There were differences between the groups in terms of what they did with their hair,1374139.0,1378178.0
48,"and how they wore their -- they wore school uniforms, but there were differences in how",1378179.0,1381648.0
48,they wore their uniforms. All that type of stuff was going on. Yeah. I was not expecting,1381649.0,1388189.0
48,that. L: Yeah. After being told you were expecting,1388190.0,1390868.0
48,"everyone to just be one big happy melting pot, those group creation strategies were",1390869.0,1398158.0
48,still there. S: There's this term 'homophily' -- I,1398159.0,1404219.0
48,"think 'homophily.' It's basically, when there are people like you, you will gravitate",1404220.0,1409678.0
48,"towards those people. I think, for me, an explanation for why we don't always see",1409679.0,1414628.0
48,that in ethnically diverse communities is because sometimes there just aren't enough,1414629.0,1419638.0
48,other people like you. You're not gonna not have any friends as a teenager. From my,1419639.0,1424820.0
48,"own experience, for example, I'm a mixed-race black woman. I grew up in the countryside",1424821.0,1429518.0

48,"remotely like me, I definitely gravitated towards them. I can personally relate to that",1438090.0,1443569.0
48,feeling. I think my experience at this school was a really nice example of where this can,1443570.0,1447709.0
48,happen -- it does happen -- because that stuff is important.,1447710.0,1451168.0
48,"L: I think it's one of those things where, especially when there is a feeling that there",1451169.0,1457369.0
48,"is so much divide around race or ethnicity, we can forget that being aware of race is",1457370.0,1464518.0
48,not in itself a racist action. Students in this school are probably doing a better job,1464519.0,1472388.0
48,of navigating a complex cultural environment than a lot of adults seem to manage to do.,1472389.0,1479279.0
48,S: I think then the interesting thing for me was how that then related to their language,1479280.0,1484998.0
48,"and their linguistic practices. Going back to what I was interested in in the beginning,",1484999.0,1490459.0
48,"Multicultural London English, that definitely was present, but there were differences, particularly",1490460.0,1495219.0
48,"for the girls. The white squad girls sounded, without doing any recordings or analysis,",1495220.0,1500768.0
48,they just sounded very different to their peers. Their pronunciation was different.,1500769.0,1506319.0
48,They did not have the same vowels that were documented in the MLE literature. What I heard,1506320.0,1513548.0
48,"then played out in my analysis. Unfortunately, I didn't get a huge amount of data from",1513549.0,1518089.0
48,"the boys, so it's difficult to say for sure, but there was definitely descriptive evidence",1518090.0,1522928.0
48,that there were differences for -- the black boys were the more advanced in terms of MLE,1522929.0,1528329.0
48,"pronunciation, as in they sounded the most MLE, shall we say, than the other boys. There",1528330.0,1534028.0
48,were definitely ethnic differences going on there. That's not to say it was just about,1534029.0,1537868.0
48,ethnicity. There's all this other stuff going on. It's definitely gendered. There's,1537869.0,1541579.0
48,definitely stuff going on also in terms of their school identity -- how they orientated,1541580.0,1546689.0
48,"towards the school. The main squad, for example, they were a mixed ethnicity group, and those",1546690.0,1552509.0
48,"girls didn't tend to sound as MLE as, say, the black squad. But they were also very pro-school.",1552510.0,1560378.0
48,They wanted to do well in school. There were differences in terms of that type of stuff.,1560379.0,1565379.0
48,It's just super complex. L: That reminds me a little bit of Mary Bucholtz's,1565380.0,1569278.0
48,work in the US looking at nerd girls and how people who are pro-school and very comfortable,1569279.0,1576798.0
48,"with school tend to have more standardised language, and they're moving more towards",1576799.0,1583689.0
48,using the teachers as their peers almost more than their actual peer groups because they,1583690.0,1588378.0
48,want to set themselves apart. It's interesting that those dynamics play out in this context,1588379.0,1593738.0
48,"as well. S: Absolutely. Even with the boys, there were",1593739.0,1597278.0
48,"two boys. They were both really bright, just characters, really stood out in their year",1597279.0,1604969.0

48,"London, but not this shift in vowels and grammar that we see in MLE. Then John, on the other",1621110.0,1627719.0
48,"hand, he was smart. He did do well at school, but he very intentionally -- it's almost",1627720.0,1633189.0
48,like he kept that hidden. It wasn't part of his identity to be good at school. It was,1633190.0,1638258.0
48,"part of his identity to be, like, a cool guy. He was really into music. He sounded very",1638259.0,1644618.0
48,"MLE. So, there's definitely all of that interesting stuff going on here as well. It",1644619.0,1648418.0
48,just would've been really nice to have got some more data from a greater range of kids,1648419.0,1652069.0
48,"in this school because I think, yeah, to be able to unpick all of that a little bit more",1652070.0,1656839.0
48,I think would've been really nice. L: Was that part of what your ethnographic,1656840.0,1660668.0
48,methods were trying to get at -- understanding all of these social dynamics?,1660669.0,1665178.0
48,"S: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, all of that stuff I just told you about -- the different characteristics",1665179.0,1669729.0

48,"I went to school three to five days a week, not necessarily for the entire school day",1674530.0,1678558.0

48,through their -- they had their recess break mid-morning and then they had their lunch,1684340.0,1688069.0
48,break. I would always be there for those periods so that I could go and hang out with them,1688070.0,1691618.0
48,outside when they weren't in the classroom. L: They got used to you being around.,1691619.0,1696268.0
48,"S: Yeah. Because of the way that the national curriculum is designed, when they're in",1696269.0,1700888.0
48,"lessons, it's just like, they're on a schedule. They have stuff to get through.",1700889.0,1704058.0
48,There's a lot of content that is being delivered and that they're supposed to be kind of,1704059.0,1707479.0
48,-- so actually the amount of interaction they're doing in the classroom really varied.,1707480.0,1712158.0
48,"One of my favourite lessons to observe, actually, was they had a citizenship lesson. That was",1712159.0,1716358.0
48,"a lot more -- there was a lot more dialogue because that was that was part of the, you",1716359.0,1719058.0
48,"know. But something like English or maths was just like, content, content, content,",1719059.0,1723449.0
48,learn this stuff. Being outside was really key to be able to have that. Then it was interesting,1723450.0,1728798.0
48,to be able to reflect and see how much of what was going on outside was brought into,1728799.0,1732638.0
48,the classroom in terms of their social dynamics and things. I even went and observed after,1732639.0,1738090.0
48,"school things, netball games, theatre stuff. I really tried to see them in as many contexts",1738091.0,1744089.0
48,as possible to be able to understand their social practices and linguistic practices,1744090.0,1748748.0
48,"as fully as possible. L: Amazing. Because language is, as you have",1748749.0,1753128.0
48,"discovered, incredibly complex and messy and tied up in our identity and our aspirations",1753129.0,1760069.0
48,and our peer groups. It's really great to have been able to go really deep into one,1760070.0,1766398.0
48,little community and see what was happening there.,1766399.0,1768748.0
48,S: Definitely. I think that's part of what drew me to working with teenagers specifically,1768749.0,1774279.0
48,"because I think that's when we're most creative, I think, because we're figuring",1774280.0,1778219.0
48,all of that stuff out. It was really fascinating to see that in action and be with these kids,1778220.0,1783038.0
48,for a year and see how they changed over that time. It was a real privilege to be able to,1783039.0,1788929.0
48,have done that. L: And you finished your PhD around 12 months,1788930.0,1793319.0
48,ago? S: A bit longer. It's two years since I,1793320.0,1796388.0
48,submitted my thesis. We just have a really delayed graduation in the UK.,1796389.0,1800128.0

48,"by the time I finished it, they would've left school But what I did do was, after I",1811059.0,1816788.0

48,"that all of this stuff has a function, and this stuff is part of your identity, and it's",1837989.0,1842668.0
48,legitimate? It's not wrong or incorrect.' That was really important to me to be able,1842669.0,1847618.0
48,to do that for them because I think that's definitely a message that gets given to adolescents,1847619.0,1852548.0
48,repeatedly through schools in the UK is that there's a right and wrong way to speak.,1852549.0,1857819.0

48,I tried to carry that on throughout my PhD. I was never really 100% sure that academia,1903960.0,1909778.0

48,tried all that stuff -- is also really fascinating to me. It's been a really good alternative,1980460.0,1985319.0
48,career track to go down for sure. L: When you say it's research that directly,1985320.0,1991058.0
48,"affects policy, you mean government policy around the implementation of different programmes",1991059.0,1996678.0
48,and stuff. There's a really direct line between the research projects that you do,1996679.0,2002108.0
48,and that feeding into things that change government policy or direct government policy.,2002109.0,2008378.0
48,S: Yeah. Sometimes it's about evaluating programmes and assessing whether those programmes,2008379.0,2014648.0
48,"have any impact, that they're doing what they're intended to do. Are they making",2014649.0,2018148.0
48,"any change? Sometimes it's just actually finding out about, okay, the government has",2018149.0,2023558.0

48,-- how do they actually feel about it? How is it actually affecting their lives? One,2028059.0,2032269.0
48,project that I did recently was about shared parental leave. That was a policy. It was,2032270.0,2036158.0
48,implemented in 2014. It was this idea that in the UK you still just have maternity and,2036159.0,2042009.0
48,"paternity leave. Now, you can split it between both parents. So, it not only improves things",2042010.0,2048849.0

48,"L: Sounds great! S: There's a lot more options. Yes, sounds",2060510.0,2063928.0
48,"great! In theory. But there's not been as much take up as they had hoped, so our project",2063929.0,2068979.0
48,"-- we interviewed people who had taken it and who had chosen not to, and their employers,",2068980.0,2073418.0

48,also what kind of workplace barriers might there be to why people have not engaged with,2077050.0,2081990.0
48,this policy as much as might have been hoped. That was really fascinating to be able to,2081991.0,2086799.0
48,do that. It's really topical. It's something that while we were doing the research every,2086800.0,2091979.0
48,month The Guardian was publishing an article about it. It was something that was really,2091980.0,2096169.0

48,okay with to move into working in a non-academic research stream. But did it feel like an easy,2115170.0,2122909.0
48,decision at the time? Or it is something that was more difficult?,2122910.0,2126209.0
48,"S: I mean, I'll be honest, it didn't feel like a decision. It felt like just kind of",2126210.0,2131219.0

48,"I'm definitely very happy where I am now, but it took a while to get there, Lauren.",2137910.0,2143539.0
48,It took a while. [Laughs] I had a lot of feelings about not getting an academic job. I felt,2143540.0,2153929.0
48,like I'd failed because I'd not got a job in academia. I felt resentful because,2153930.0,2158249.0
48,I'd done everything that I was supposed to do. I'd not just done my PhD. I did the,2158250.0,2165469.0
48,teaching on top of it. I worked as an RA. I did all this other stuff. I've got a publication.,2165470.0,2171409.0
48,And then that still wasn't good enough to even get interviews. I just found that so,2171410.0,2175679.0
48,upsetting and so frustrating. But because alongside that I had done all this -- I knew,2175680.0,2181709.0

48,from -- your professors have generally been in academia for a while. That's why they're,2212480.0,2218809.0
48,professors and supervising dissertations. And it means that training people in linguistics,2218810.0,2223889.0

48,She went straight from her PhD at Stanford to a full-time permanent job at Kings and,2253550.0,2259069.0
48,then moved to Queen Mary. While they were supportive and endeavoured to help me to be,2259070.0,2265049.0
48,"realistic, I think the fact is that's not their experience of the academic job market.",2265050.0,2269889.0
48,They're not able to give realistic advice. I should also say that I was very clear in,2269890.0,2278239.0
48,"that I did not want to move around. I was like, 'I've already done that. I've",2278240.0,2282389.0

49,translation and the Heaney translation? L: Yeah. This is super fun.,421370.0,424788.0

49,at that point. Ada Palmer was talking about how this was translated into French where,1206320.0,1211969.0
49,"in modern English the progressive thing that people do is like, 'Oh, we can use singular",1211970.0,1215248.0
49,"they. That's very progressive.' In modern French, the progressive thing that people",1215249.0,1218579.0
49,do is they make feminine versions of all of the professions.,1218580.0,1221729.0
49,L: Right. G: You have feminine versions of 'professor',1221730.0,1225368.0
49,or 'doctor' or these kinds of things to try and make the gender more visible. And,1225369.0,1228589.0
49,so erase the gender in the French version wouldn't have the same effect -- where,1228590.0,1234028.0
49,you'd end up using the default masculine or something in the French version -- it,1234029.0,1237038.0
49,wouldn't have the same effect as using singular they all the time in the English version.,1237039.0,1243138.0
49,There are modern French pronouns like 'iel' that have been coined to solve this problem,1243139.0,1248388.0
49,"of using a gender neutral third person pronoun, but it wouldn't work to use them in this",1248389.0,1251849.0
49,particular case because the style is supposed to be faux-archaic. What the translator ended,1251850.0,1256859.0
49,"up doing was digging out this French pronoun 'on,' which in the modern form 'on'",1256860.0,1262339.0
49,"is used like 'we' or like 'one does this.' It's related to like, 'One does",1262340.0,1267048.0
49,this.' There's an older usage of 'on' which is like a non-specific third person,1267049.0,1272319.0
49,"pronoun as well that -- I speak French, but I didn't know about this archaic form. And",1272320.0,1277149.0
49,the translator went and looked for what other historic pronoun things could I do and ended,1277150.0,1281769.0

49,"L: The thing I find interesting is if you were -- 50 years ago, you didn't have the",1285809.0,1291378.0
49,grammatical resources in English to use singular they for a specific person. It's something,1291379.0,1296058.0
49,that's really only emerged in the last couple of decades. I think the translator has felt,1296059.0,1303038.0
49,"frustrated to not have -- you know, you sometimes feel like you've got this road block because",1303039.0,1308259.0

49,I did have a colleague in Italian studies tell me that they read a whole novel once,1312090.0,1318498.0

50,"certain things you can do with certain sounds, at least in English, if we start with English,",342720.0,346719.0
50,and then there're things you don't do with them any other way. If we think about,346720.0,350799.0
50,"words in English can begin with groups of consonants like B-R, B-L, K-R, K-L, G-L, G-R,",350800.0,361839.0

50,G: L-G. Because I'm trying to move them in my head as I'm doing them. You have a word in English like,379920.0,386239.0
50,"'trust' or 'trend' which has T-R at the beginning, but you don't have 'rtuts' or 'rtedn.'",386240.0,395999.0

50,Or you have something like 'plant' but not 'lpatn.',403440.0,407039.0
50,L: What is a possible combination and order at the start of a word is different to what's a possible,407040.0,412319.0
50,combination and order at the end of a word. We talked about this in our episode on syllables.,412320.0,418639.0
50,G: What's interesting is that they kind of mirror each other. You have something like R-D at the,418640.0,424319.0
50,"end of a word or at the end of a syllable, or you can have D-R at the beginning, and in both cases,",424320.0,428399.0
50,it's the D that's kind of on either side of the outskirts and the R that's closer towards the,428400.0,433839.0
50,centre -- closer towards the vowel in the middle. L: I guess like 'clean' and 'milk' that /kl/,433840.0,440639.0
50,and then that /lk/ at the beginning and the end. G: Yeah. There's this weird thing that I've always,440640.0,445839.0
50,found particularly peculiar about English where English for some reason doesn't,445840.0,451199.0
50,like having the same cluster at both the beginning and end at of the same syllable.,451200.0,455999.0

50,that is one of your tickets to do that. L: Mirroring sounds at the beginning and,480080.0,484559.0
50,end of the syllable. I'll keep that in mind for the next weird conlang I have to create.,484560.0,490079.0
50,"G: You notice this sort of mirroring thinking, 'Okay, well, L is always happier' -- you can have",490080.0,495359.0
50,"something that just begins with L and has nothing else, right. But this is in cases where you have",495360.0,499199.0
50,complex consonant clusters. The L is always happier nearer the middle of the word -- nearer,499200.0,504399.0
50,with middle of the syllable. We're just dealing with single syllable words because it's more,504400.0,508079.0
50,straightforward to look at them that way because you know all of the sounds have to belong to the,508080.0,511119.0
50,same syllable if the word only has one syllable. Then K is happier on the outskirts. You can think,511120.0,517839.0
50,"of it like there's a mountain, right, you know, you have the vowel is the peak of your mountain,",517840.0,522399.0

50,L: The kinds of letters that hang out at different altitudes on our little mountain walk have similar,542480.0,549039.0
50,properties. Maybe we should go for a little hike. Shall we start maybe at the top of the hill? Or,549040.0,556079.0
50,get helicoptered in? Or maybe take a chair lift? G: Let's pretend we've gotten teleported in,556080.0,561999.0
50,to the top of the mountain. L: Which is where our vowels hang,562000.0,565359.0
50,out -- vowels having the particular property in how they're produced that you don't close off anything,565360.0,572559.0
50,in your squishy meat tube to produce a vowel. You can change the shape of it.,572560.0,578159.0
50,That's why we have different vowels. But it's just a continuous airflow situation.,578160.0,582959.0
50,G: 'Squishy meat tube' being the technical term for 'vocal tract.',582960.0,589519.0
50,[Laughter] Vowels are a kind of thing that if you're gonna have something in the middle of,589520.0,592239.0
50,"a syllable, it's most likely to be a vowel. L: If you only have one thing in a syllable,",592240.0,596719.0
50,it tends to be a vowel. G: It tends to be a vowel. It's,596720.0,599119.0

50,"those don't have to have vowels in them. But there aren't a lot of words that do this. So, you",612640.0,616639.0
50,"can have a word like 'Hm' in English, but I you have 'Ahh' and 'Mmm' together in a single word,",616640.0,622959.0
50,the 'Ahh' is gonna grab the syllable spot first. L: And then descending downhill from vowels.,622960.0,629839.0
50,G: Some of the stuff involved in making diphthongs -- if you wanna make something like /oɪ/ -- /oːi/ --,629840.0,635839.0

50,a lot of air still going though. It's easy to sing. And now you've got your L and your,653200.0,657279.0

50,L: Still fun sing-y sounds if you hum along to some music.,712880.0,717119.0
50,G: Still extremely hum-able. Then you've got your sounds that you can still say by themselves like,717120.0,722479.0
50,/ʃ/ and /s/ and /f/ and /z/ and stuff like this. You can still say them by themselves without,722480.0,728719.0
50,"another vowel to come along helping them. And you can think about this -- if you have 'freeze,'",728720.0,733679.0
50,"you have F and then R, and you're heading up the mountain towards the middle vowel and then heading",733680.0,739519.0
50,"back down with the /z/. You can go through and think about, okay, what's a bunch of monosyllabic",739520.0,744959.0
50,English words with multiple consonants at the beginning or end? How can I re-constructure myself,744960.0,750239.0
50,which bits should be on which parts of the scale? L: Another example from when were talking before,750240.0,756319.0
50,"about meat tubes would be 'flesh.' [Laughter] G: Then finally you've got your Ps and Bs and /k/,",756320.0,765439.0
50,"/g/, /t/, /d/ really hanging out at the bottom where you can't make these without fully closing",765440.0,770879.0
50,"off the mouth for at least a split second. L: In fact, the only way we can really tell",770880.0,775679.0
50,which sound you're making very easily is because you stick a vowel there to help us,775680.0,780239.0
50,hear the difference between a /p/ and a /t/. G: This is a thing that really blew my mind when,780240.0,785359.0
50,I was learning about sounds like this where you fully close off the air is that what's actually,785360.0,789759.0
50,"going on here is your just hearing silence. Your brain is like, 'Oh, no, you're hearing a P'",789760.0,793919.0
50,because it makes the following vowel P-like. But actually what's there when you feel like,793920.0,799519.0
50,you're making it is just this brief split second of silence. You can see it show up on,799520.0,803519.0
50,"a wave form, but there's nothing coming out. L: It's a very exciting, very dynamic little",803520.0,809519.0
50,valley that we're in -- all these stop-y sounds G: These nice little staccatos popping off,809520.0,815199.0
50,like firecrackers or something. You think you could put your firecrackers on the top of the,815200.0,818799.0
50,"mountains so people could see them better, but that's not what our metaphor's doing.",818800.0,822353.0
50,"L: That's not how this metaphor's going at all. G: Well, you could think, well, what if we put",822354.0,826159.0
50,those firecracker-y explosive sounds at a top of a different metaphorical mountain?,826160.0,830959.0
50,But one thing that's also relevant is that this is also a degree of loudness. You can make,830960.0,835919.0
50,the sounds at the top of the mountain louder than you can make the sounds at the bottom.,835920.0,839439.0
50,"L: So, it's partly about the openness and how easy they are to sing, but there's also",839440.0,844239.0
50,"something to do with loudness happening here. G: Well, and I think when your mouth is more open,",844240.0,847999.0
50,"you can be more loud with it. If you think about if you need to scream,",848000.0,851839.0
50,you're not gonna scream like /sss/. [Laughter] Or if you're trying to really do some vocal warm,851840.0,858612.0
50,"up exercises, you're gonna be like /aaa/ or something. You're not gonna be like --",858613.0,862639.0
50,"L: /pə pə pə pə pə pə pə/. G: I mean, I guess you",862640.0,864959.0
50,could do that. That is true. L: But that's really the vowel,864960.0,867759.0
50,happening there not the /p/. G: It's not /p p p p p p p/.,867760.0,871119.0
50,"If you're trying to be really loud or really project, you're doing that with the vowels and the",871120.0,875599.0
50,ones that are closer up on the vowel mountain. If you think about the mountain as a loudness,875600.0,880079.0
50,"amplitude mountain, the louder stuff is on top. L: All these different points along our walk down",880080.0,886079.0
50,the mountain have been visiting different ways that we use the mechanics of the mouth to make,886080.0,893199.0
50,"sounds, which is something that linguists refer to as 'manner of articulation.' It's",893200.0,898159.0
50,one of those features that's represented in the International Phonetic Alphabet.,898160.0,901999.0
50,G: And the International Phonetic Alphabet kind of does the inverse metaphor where they put the,902000.0,906159.0
50,most closed ones at the top and then they go gradually down until the most open ones.,906160.0,910239.0
50,"You have to kind of flip it upside down to get the mountain, but they're still doing this",910240.0,914079.0
50,sounds exist on a continuum from how open or how closed or how singable or how unsingable,914080.0,920319.0
50,"they are. That's relevant not just in terms of, okay, how can we describe them, but in terms of",920320.0,925119.0
50,how can we put a word together? What happens when you're trying to put a syllable together?,925120.0,928799.0
50,Languages tend to have this preference which shows up across a lot of different languages for making,928800.0,933519.0
50,"a syllable that has one mountain top and its peak, even if it doesn't contain absolutely every single",933520.0,938399.0
50,point along that path because that would probably be too heavy of a syllable for most purposes.,938400.0,942319.0

50,double check these things. L: You do wanna check.,980880.0,984210.0

52,writing systems often reflect some of that history.,845519.0,848379.0

52,And I say 'approximate' because English spelling is a wonderful historical record,861470.0,868849.0
52,of how some of those sound changes have changed over time. I'm just gonna keep this upbeat.,868850.0,877099.0
52,"You can fall down a giant well of English writing system problems, but to get to a point",877100.0,884299.0

52,"as phones in the language, and that allows us to write out the words of English.",890860.0,898299.0
52,G: One of the things that's true about a lot of the Indo-European languages is that,898300.0,904018.0
52,"they have a particular ratio between consonants and vowels in the words, where they have a",904019.0,910708.0
52,fair bit of consonants in relationship to their vowels but not a ton. You can see this,910709.0,915739.0
52,in the writing system because the writing system represents consonants and vowels separately.,915740.0,920869.0
52,"And yet, when the Greeks were borrowing the alphabet from the Phoenicians -- Phoenician",920870.0,924659.0

52,in it -- letters for consonants -- because the vowels were not that important. This is,930889.0,935539.0
52,still true of modern-day Semitic languages is they're often written in writing systems,935540.0,939958.0
52,"that don't represent the vowels or kind of optionally represent the short vowels,",939959.0,944648.0
52,"or sometimes they represent the long vowels, but they're often written in writing systems",944649.0,947439.0

52,"languages where the vowels are even more important and, in fact, every consonant comes with a",968600.0,973208.0
52,"vowel or virtually every consonant comes with a vowel. In those, you often get what are",973209.0,977979.0
52,"called 'syllabaries,' where they represent one syllable at a time, because why bother",977980.0,983489.0
52,with representing each of these things separately when in every context where you have a consonant,983490.0,989569.0
52,there's gonna be a nearby vowel -- or in virtually every context there's gonna be,989570.0,991969.0
52,a nearby vowel -- and so you can have a symbol that just represents the whole syllable there.,991970.0,996458.0
52,That's also a structure that doesn't work very well for Indo-European languages because,996459.0,1001549.0
52,they don't have that many vowels. There's this spot of like they have important enough,1001550.0,1005659.0

52,"it just comes with a bonus vowel. It's like, 'Buy this consonant, get this free letter",1034410.0,1038249.0
52,A sound.' G: Right. That's partly a feature of the,1038250.0,1041198.0
52,"writing system, but it can only be a feature of the writing system because it's already",1041199.0,1044578.0
52,"a feature of the language. A similar thing goes for a language like Chinese, where a",1044579.0,1049548.0
52,lot of things are based around a syllable. L: Then you can go a level of abstraction,1049549.0,1053819.0
52,further where your character in the writing system represents a word-level thing and doesn't,1053820.0,1060658.0
52,"have a direct relationship to the sound correspondence, which is what happens with the Chinese script.",1060659.0,1066288.0
52,G: I think it's important to recognise that there is a phonetic component to Chinese characters.,1066289.0,1072768.0
52,They often make use of -- especially for words that are more abstract -- it's not,1072769.0,1077070.0
52,"just like, 'Oh, here's a bunch of little pictures that we've drawn,' because that's",1077071.0,1079918.0
52,not capable of conveying abstract concepts like grammatical particles and words for things,1079919.0,1085599.0
52,"that don't come with easy pictures. And so, making use of, 'Okay, a lot of our words",1085600.0,1090579.0
52,"are one or two syllables long, so here's a word that's relatively easy to visualise",1090580.0,1097309.0
52,that sounds very similar to a word that is not as easy to visualise.' We can just add,1097310.0,1101928.0
52,"a thing to be like, 'It sounds like this, but it's got a meaning more related to this,'",1101929.0,1105728.0
52,"and you can be like, 'Oh, it must be this more abstract word.' The classic example,",1105729.0,1110308.0
52,"which I'm definitely gonna do the tones wrong on, is that the word for 'horse'",1110309.0,1113808.0
52,"is /ma/, and the word for mother is also /ma/ with a different tone, and you can add the",1113809.0,1119398.0
52,"little horse semantic component with the woman semantic component and be like, 'Oh, it's",1119399.0,1123599.0
52,"the word that sounds like 'horse' but has to do with something with a woman,'",1123600.0,1127058.0
52,and then you end up with 'mother.' L: This works for languages in China because,1127059.0,1132819.0
52,they tend to be not as long as words in English. We like to add all these extra bits of morphology,1132820.0,1139308.0
52,"within our grammar, whereas, again, you get -- not a direct rule force -- but you get",1139309.0,1145928.0
52,this general tendency where the writing system kind of fits with the vibe of the grammar,1145929.0,1151238.0
52,of the language. G: One example of that is in Japanese where,1151239.0,1155868.0
52,"they were heavily influenced by the Chinese script, but Japanese actually does have suffixes",1155869.0,1160168.0
52,and other little grammatical words and things you need to change about words. They made,1160169.0,1164898.0
52,"some of the Chinese characters that had formerly only had semantic things into just like, 'Oh,",1164899.0,1169649.0
52,"this makes this sound, and this makes this sound,' because they needed to be able to",1169650.0,1173872.0
52,represent that morphological information that's not super important in Chinese but is very,1173873.0,1177728.0
52,important in Japanese. You end up adapting a script into something else when it gets,1177729.0,1182969.0
52,borrowed in a different context. Another interesting example here is Farsi or Persian which is,1182970.0,1189349.0
52,an Indo-European language that's conventionally written with the same script as Arabic except,1189350.0,1194638.0
52,it's also had a couple of additional letters added because Persian has a P and Arabic doesn't.,1194639.0,1200518.0
52,"They had to create a symbol for the sound P, which is why you get 'Farsi' instead",1200519.0,1205008.0
52,"of 'Parsi' because Arabic doesn't pronounce that P. So, it makes the P into an F. Sometimes",1205009.0,1210669.0
52,you get people adding additional letters like adding a letter for P. Sometimes you get adapting,1210670.0,1215599.0
52,whole sets of a script. L: Sometimes you lose letters. English had,1215600.0,1219908.0
52,distinct characters for /θ/ and /ð/ until it was technologically easier to just use,1219909.0,1227008.0
52,the characters in the printing press that English had borrowed. It's makes me a little,1227009.0,1232288.0
52,"bit sad. But also, it makes international people -- maybe it's a little bit easier.",1232289.0,1237118.0
52,"G: We used to have a thorn for the /ð/ sound, but those early printing presses from continental",1237119.0,1243469.0
52,"Europe didn't have thorns on them. I mean, Icelandic still has thorns. One of the things",1243470.0,1248288.0
52,that I think is more interesting in the closer to modern era -- not strictly modern era,1248289.0,1252808.0
52,-- is cultures and peoples that are familiar with the idea of writing yet take the idea,1252809.0,1258349.0
52,"of writing and say, 'We're gonna make our own homegrown script that actually works",1258350.0,1261459.0
52,"really well for our particular language.' One of my favourites is the Cherokee syllabary,",1261460.0,1266459.0
52,"which was invented by Sequoyah, who was a Cherokee man who didn't know how to read",1266460.0,1270398.0
52,"in English, but he'd encountered the Latin-based writing system in English. He thought it was",1270399.0,1275778.0
52,"cool that the English speakers had this, and so he locked himself in shed for several years",1275779.0,1284079.0
52,and came up with a syllabary for Cherokee. Some of the symbols on the Cherokee syllabary,1284080.0,1290579.0
52,"look something like Latin letters, but they stand for completely different things because",1290580.0,1295518.0
52,he wasn't just learning to read from English. Some of them are completely different. This,1295519.0,1299839.0
52,became hugely popular among the Cherokee in the area. There were newspapers in this in,1299840.0,1305248.0
52,the 1800s. There was very high literacy in Cherokee country. It was really popular. It's,1305249.0,1310849.0
52,even still found on modern-day computer keyboards and stuff like this. You can get Windows and,1310850.0,1316569.0
52,stuff in Cherokee. It's this interesting example of that's one where we can say a,1316570.0,1321158.0
52,particular person was inspired by writing systems but also created his own thing that,1321159.0,1327579.0
52,became very popular. L: The thing that makes Cherokee so compelling,1327580.0,1330848.0
52,"to me is not only did he come up with an incredibly elegant, well thought out, suits the language",1330849.0,1337699.0
52,"system, but that he actually got uptake as well -- that the community decided to use",1337700.0,1342388.0
52,"this as the writing system that they would learn to read and write in, and that it had",1342389.0,1347398.0

52,"as I think you're fond of saying, language is very much an open-source project. You can",1353830.0,1357758.0
52,"come up with really elegant solutions, but if no one else is gonna take them up, that's",1357759.0,1362979.0
52,"not gonna be very helpful. So, Sequoyah's work is doubly amazing for that reason.",1362980.0,1368378.0
52,G: People actually made printing presses with the Cherokee symbols and were using those.,1368379.0,1374089.0
52,Another interesting case of this disconnect between a person or people coming up with,1374090.0,1379148.0
52,"a system and actual uptake of it is Korean, which has what I think linguists generally",1379149.0,1384478.0

52,is amazing. All writing systems are equally valid. But Korean is particularly great.',1388649.0,1393738.0
52,G: 'But Korean's really cool.' The thing that's cool about it from a completely biased,1393739.0,1399399.0
52,"linguist perspective is that the writing system of Korean, Hangul, the script, is not just",1399400.0,1405459.0
52,"based on individual sounds or phonemes, it's actually at a more precise level based on",1405460.0,1414048.0
52,the shape of the mouth and how you configure the mouth in order to make those particular,1414049.0,1418579.0
52,"sounds. There's a lot of, okay, here are these closely related sounds -- let's say",1418580.0,1422868.0
52,you make them all with the lips -- and you just add an additional stroke to make it this,1422869.0,1427579.0
52,"other related sound that you make with the lips. Between P and B and M, which are all",1427580.0,1433089.0
52,"made with the lips, those symbols have a similar shape. It's not an accident. It's very",1433090.0,1437928.0
52,systematic between that and the same thing with T and D and N. Those have a similar shape,1437929.0,1443138.0
52,because they have this relationship. It's very technically beautiful from an analysis,1443139.0,1449189.0
52,of language perspective. L: I love this so much that when we were prototyping,1449190.0,1453738.0
52,"a potential script for the Aramteskan language for the Shadowscent books, when I was constructing",1453739.0,1459319.0
52,"that language, I also started constructing a script that we never used anywhere, but",1459320.0,1464398.0
52,it was helpful to think about how the characters would write and what writing implements they,1464399.0,1469298.0
52,"would use. If you look at the script, you'll notice that the letter P and B are very similar,",1469299.0,1475189.0

52,"reasons that I decided to go with a feature-based system, and that is that it was easier for",1503299.0,1507479.0
52,me to remember if I used the features of the language and made sure that the voiced sound,1507480.0,1513959.0

53,they'll sometimes use 'mode' and talk about 'modality' If you see something,1959040.0,1962408.0
53,"that's talking about 'modality' in linguistics, it's generally talking about, well, is it",1962409.0,1966279.0
53,just a declarative sentence explaining how the world works or is it in one of these other,1966280.0,1971349.0
53,modes like the imperative. There are a whole bunch of others in this category.,1971350.0,1975908.0
53,"G: Well, and sometimes 'modality' is also used for modals, like 'can' and 'must'",1975909.0,1979909.0

53,"L: With evidentiality, which is something we've done a whole episode on, there is",1988190.0,1993099.0
53,a lot of discussion about -- G: Which is your favourite thing.,1993100.0,1994699.0
53,L: Which is one of my favourite things. There's a whole discussion about whether evidentiality,1994700.0,1998308.0
53,"is its own category separate from mode, or if it sits within a more lumper definition",1998309.0,2004668.0
53,"of 'mode,' or whether we split it off as its own, or if it sits in a subcategory.",2004669.0,2009339.0

53,just talk about a general class of objects or a particular class of students. It has,2072110.0,2078499.0
53,all these different meanings. I think 'mode' is one of those similar words that has lots,2078500.0,2085209.0
53,of different meanings but in linguistics tends to have this specific meaning.,2085210.0,2088339.0
53,"G: Yeah. And this is a thing that academic disciplines, especially, in the natural philosophy",2088340.0,2093409.0

53,"a reptile is now,' or like, 'Technically, this is what a mood is now. This is what a",2111580.0,2114969.0
53,mode is.' You end up with this situation where the technical definitions and the vernacular,2114970.0,2122109.0
53,"definitions co-exist. That can sometimes lead to almost more confusion where you're like,",2122110.0,2127229.0

53,this new word and it refers to this specific thing and it always refers to that.' There,2140730.0,2144339.0
53,isn't this competing vernacular definition that also exists. The way that this often,2144340.0,2148369.0
53,"gets taught in classrooms is like, 'Well, the vernacular version you learned is wrong.",2148370.0,2153439.0
53,This is the real definition.' But I think we're interested in describing language,2153440.0,2158329.0
53,"and saying, descriptively, people use 'mode' in all sorts of different ways -- people",2158330.0,2161839.0
53,use 'mood' in all sorts of different ways. It's just that in certain contexts there's,2161840.0,2165299.0
53,"this one very particular definition that it's used with in this one case. Oh, 'case,'",2165300.0,2171359.0
53,"that's another one. Look, you can use 'case' to mean a whole lot of things! There's one",2171360.0,2176949.0

53,Sometimes the metaphor goes in the other direction. Sometimes a word gets borrowed from grammatical,2181530.0,2184889.0
53,terminology into the more generic life circumstances as well. 'Gender' initially referred to,2184890.0,2191679.0

53,"Latin has a reputation of like, 'Oh, I didn't understand grammar until I studied Latin.'",2260190.0,2265179.0
53,That's not because other languages don't have grammar. It's because a lot of our,2265180.0,2271069.0
53,grammatical terminology was invented specifically for Latin and to work really well with Latin.,2271070.0,2276269.0
53,Then you end up learning about how English grammar works because you learn Latin in a,2276270.0,2281749.0
53,"very translate-y sort of way, and you learn what the reflexes are of particular English-y",2281750.0,2287349.0
53,things in Latin or of things in another language in Latin. It feels like Latin grammar is easier,2287350.0,2294059.0

53,"perspective. G: I think, having studied both Latin and",2312670.0,2315749.0
53,"linguistics, there's a sense in which the grammar of Latin is very catalogued in many",2315750.0,2320449.0
53,"cases, it's very pinned down, because it's not a language that's actively being spoken",2320450.0,2324069.0
53,by people. It has been finitely described. The thing that excites me about linguistics,2324070.0,2329879.0
53,"is you can approach grammar in this more experimental way where you can say things like, 'Is the",2329880.0,2336039.0

53,it's so interactively complicated and fascinating. I think that's what keeps bringing me back,2377190.0,2384489.0
53,to this category. G: Which makes it a good introduction to the,2384490.0,2388729.0
53,"idea of, okay, how could we do these categories? What does it mean for a verb to have a 'mood'",2388730.0,2393789.0
53,"or a 'mode'? Whereas something like with the subjunctive, which is another mood, is",2393790.0,2399129.0

54,L: Awesome! Pick out the anecdotes for us. G: One of the first observations that it,788080.0,792879.0
54,"makes -- and, when you think about this, it's totally true -- is that -- so the European",792880.0,797759.0

54,"you do a lot of changing the endings on words -- sometimes the prefixes, but often the",804240.0,809759.0
54,endings -- on words to make them do grammatical things. The European grammatical tradition,809760.0,817519.0

54,it makes it a little bit confusing sometimes when you apply it to a language like English that,832560.0,836719.0

54,of English is very much in that Latin tradition. G: It's inherited from the Latin tradition.,842240.0,846959.0

54,"you need to learn them, and you need to learn what they correspond to and what their function is.'",869360.0,873439.0
54,L: Right. G: What's interesting is that the,873440.0,876479.0
54,grammar of Chinese is different from that. They don't do endings. What they do instead is you,876480.0,881759.0
54,"have things that have a grammatical function, but they're considered to have the same status as full",881760.0,886879.0
54,"words. And so, the Chinese grammatical tradition is concerned with looking at those particles that",886880.0,894399.0
54,have grammatical functions but are hard to write definitions of and cataloguing them and figuring,894400.0,901759.0

54,They don't have endings like the verbs and the nouns do. The Latin tradition grammarians didn't,918480.0,923839.0
54,"care about those words, and they were really into the endings. The Chinese grammarians were really",923840.0,929919.0
54,"interested in, first of all, this fundamental duality between words that had a meaning to them,",929920.0,935519.0

54,what the patterns are' with a template verb that you can show all the patterns with and going,1298720.0,1305759.0
54,through and exhaustively cataloguing the patterns. This is the exciting thing to do if you're an,1305760.0,1310559.0
54,ancient Arabic grammarian. I'm excited by just thinking about it. But that's very much influenced,1310560.0,1314559.0
54,by the structure of the language. I don't know as much about what Paṇini was doing except for,1314560.0,1318479.0
54,the fact that he gets cited in a lot of Intro Linguistics classes as the first grammarian.,1318480.0,1321919.0
54,L: Part of why he gets cited a lot is because he's excellent. I'll talk about,1321920.0,1327039.0
54,that. I think part of why as well is that Paṇini synthesized and brought together,1327040.0,1334239.0
54,everything that had been happening in the Sanskrit grammar tradition. Sanskrit is kind of like,1334240.0,1340879.0
54,"the Indian linguistic area equivalent of Latin, which is that it was the language of sacred texts",1340880.0,1348079.0
54,and religion. It's a language that is still handed down. People still learn Sanskrit in the way they,1348080.0,1353999.0
54,"learn Latin. But in that area, languages like Hindi and Nepali, the Indo-Aryan languages,",1354000.0,1360319.0
54,are all later siblings and children of Sanskrit. It's a very convenient analogy to Latin to draw,1360320.0,1369359.0
54,"with Sanskrit. I think, also, the motivation for thinking a lot about the language came from",1369360.0,1376559.0
54,a theological attempt within Hinduism to understand truth through language and,1376560.0,1382879.0
54,understand how language works. It was one of the core areas of study within,1382880.0,1387759.0
54,"the larger religious tradition. So, that was the motivation. But Paṇini -- we know his name. We know",1387760.0,1395519.0
54,not too much else about him except that he wrote at least two-and-a-half thousand years ago.,1395520.0,1400399.0
54,"He synthesized this work, and he name drops ten other people whose work he draws on. We've lost",1400400.0,1406079.0
54,the record of all of their work. I think he's excellent. That's not in dispute. But it's also,1406080.0,1412159.0
54,just a convenient prominence he receives through being the kind of earliest record we have when the,1412160.0,1419359.0
54,work was going on for thousands of years behand. G: The person whose manuscript,1419360.0,1422959.0
54,survives with his name attached to it. L: Absolutely. A very convenient way to appear,1422960.0,1428559.0
54,to be very excellent is just to have none of the foundational work you draw on exist still.,1428560.0,1433039.0
54,G: No. This is like the Library of Alexandria all over again.,1433040.0,1439679.0
54,L: What made Paṇini's approach really distinct -- and distinct from what was happening with,1439680.0,1446159.0
54,those learner-driven motivations for analysing Latin -- is that there was a logical,1446160.0,1452799.0
54,progress to how he set out his description of Sanskrit. Similar to what we talked about with,1452800.0,1458159.0
54,modern grammars where you start with the base elements of the sound system and then build up,1458160.0,1464479.0
54,"to words and parts of words. If something goes on a word after another bit, so you'll describe",1464480.0,1472959.0
54,the earlier bits first and build outwards. It's this logical order and progression.,1472960.0,1478239.0
54,"G: In a very real sense, the order that Paṇini devised over",1478240.0,1483359.0
54,"2,500 years ago is reflected in the order of the grammar that you wrote a few years ago?",1483360.0,1487679.0
54,"L: It's absolutely not an accident. The early 20th Century linguists like Saussure, Franz Bopp,",1487680.0,1495519.0
54,"where directly reading Paṇini and going, 'This guy was doing this stuff thousands of years before",1495520.0,1502799.0
54,we started thinking about it' and were directly influenced by Paṇini's approach to thinking about,1502800.0,1510719.0
54,how the language worked and thinking about it very descriptively. This is why he's known as the first,1510720.0,1515279.0
54,"grammarian within even the Western tradition because he was like, 'Look, there's these",1515280.0,1521599.0
54,"words and they have these histories, but actually, the important thing is that we think about how the",1521600.0,1525439.0
54,words are being used by people now.' The funny thing is he wrote that about what we now think of,1525440.0,1530639.0
54,"as Classic Sanskrit. People have not moved on from thinking about Classical Sanskrit in that way,",1530640.0,1536479.0
54,"and it's become a learning tool, but -- G: We should all just be",1536480.0,1539839.0
54,speaking Classical Sanskrit. L: The motivation is exactly the same,1539840.0,1544879.0
54,motivation we use in a descriptive grammar now. It's not about setting out the rules of a language,1544880.0,1549039.0
54,"and how it has to work, it reflects how a linguist has analysed that people are using that system.",1549040.0,1554799.0
54,G: I think that's one of the things that comes up when we talk about a grammar,1554800.0,1557919.0
54,"is, particularly because grammar in the Western tradition is associated with Latin, and, okay,",1557920.0,1564399.0
54,you're learning about the grammar of English only so that you can translation Latin into English,1564400.0,1568559.0
54,better rather than learning about the grammar of English as an object of its own study. This,1568560.0,1573279.0
54,"translates into, 'Okay, well, what if we made the grammar of English more like Latin because that",1573280.0,1577599.0
54,"would obviously be better.' That's where this secondary meaning of 'grammar' as, you know,",1577600.0,1583759.0
54,"'Thou shalt not split an infinitive,' does -- because in Latin an infinitive is all just one",1583760.0,1589119.0
54,word. You can't split it. It's just one word. L: You can't split it.,1589120.0,1592959.0
54,"G: This idea that grammar is a tool to beat people over the head with comes from this, 'Well, you've",1592960.0,1599279.0

54,"and it's not evolving, and so you're just learning to do this very particular thing,' that's where",1607920.0,1612959.0
54,this additional connotation of grammar as a stick to beat people over the head with comes in.,1612960.0,1617439.0
54,L: That's that very Latin tradition that we still have.,1617440.0,1620639.0
54,G: And it's not only English that had a grammar as a tool to stay in touch with a lost golden age.,1620640.0,1628719.0
54,"This is also what they were doing in ancient Chinese of like, here's this older thing.",1628720.0,1633359.0
54,"One of the other interesting things that I learned about the Chinese grammatical tradition,",1633360.0,1637039.0
54,in particular with the writing system -- because the writing system in Chinese can obscure,1637040.0,1641999.0
54,different pronunciations -- you could have a poem that you could still read,1642000.0,1646159.0
54,"in the written sense that's very old but, for a modern reader, it doesn't necessarily rhyme.",1646160.0,1651919.0
54,"At a certain point, when they were doing more historical linguistics, they realised, 'Oh,",1651920.0,1655359.0
54,this poem actually rhymed back in the day.' The pronunciation has changed so much that we weren't,1655360.0,1660879.0
54,"really thinking about it because the characters look the same, but it actually used to rhyme,",1660880.0,1663919.0
54,"which sometimes shows up when you're reading Shakespeare or something, and it's got",1663920.0,1667439.0
54,"'thrown' and 'drown' or something. Like, 'Wait, those probably were supposed to rhyme based on",1667440.0,1672399.0
54,where they are in this poem.' You can use that to reconstruct what was going on.,1672400.0,1679039.0
54,L: It can feel a bit anxiety-provoking about committing and analysis to paper because you are,1679040.0,1688399.0
54,"pinning a butterfly for a moment in time. People are still speaking the language,",1688400.0,1693519.0
54,and it moves on. As long as you don't think of the descriptive grammar as anything more canonical and,1693520.0,1700879.0
54,"authoritative than people's actual intuitions, that's an important thing to remember. Especially",1700880.0,1705519.0
54,"if you're working with a grammar that's more than a few generations old, it may be that the person",1705520.0,1710639.0
54,didn't quite capture what people were doing. It may be that the language has changed again.,1710640.0,1715279.0
54,G: Another thing that I found really interesting about 'What are the ideas that people were,1715280.0,1720479.0
54,thinking about at the time' -- so this is from Grammar West to East again. The author points out,1720480.0,1726479.0
54,"that when Chinese characters first became known in Europe, it was late 16th Century and, in Europe,",1726480.0,1732719.0
54,"for unrelated reasons, the idea of a universal language was the hot philosophical topic. You had",1732720.0,1742239.0
54,"people like John Wilkins, who ultimately created Roget's Thesaurus, but he was really just trying",1742240.0,1747279.0
54,"to make a universal taxonomy for understanding the world, he ended up making quite a nice thesaurus",1747280.0,1752559.0
54,but not with making a universal way of understanding the world. What was actually going,1752560.0,1757679.0
54,on in China at the time was that Classical Chinese was a scholarly and diplomatic lingua franca,1757680.0,1764559.0
54,of the East Asian region. It was acquired as a learned language in the different parts of,1764560.0,1769519.0
54,"those regions. The Chinese words were given a local pronunciation. So, children in different",1769520.0,1773919.0
54,"parts of China would learn to read using a literary register of the local dialect,",1773920.0,1777679.0
54,and there wasn't the idea of a standard spoken language for the whole country. That's a modern,1777680.0,1781279.0
54,innovation. This is a situation that was a lot like Latin in Europe at the time.,1781280.0,1786399.0
54,"But Europe, you know, 'Oh, you learn Latin in school so that you can do the literary thing.'",1786400.0,1790799.0
54,But European scholars misunderstood the situation and thought that this meant that Chinese,1790800.0,1795199.0
54,"characters were interpretable by speakers of any language without them being based on one language,",1795200.0,1800479.0
54,even though they were very much based on an ancestral language of the region.,1800480.0,1805199.0
54,L: Oh dear. And their obsession with universality that they came to this very functional but still,1805200.0,1811839.0
54,based on a language thing. Oh dear. I see exactly where this is going. That's not good.,1811840.0,1817199.0
54,"G: Also, they did the same thing with the Egyptian hieroglyphs, which had not yet been",1817200.0,1820959.0
54,"deciphered yet. They were like, 'Guys, we found it! We found the universal language of ideas,",1820960.0,1827279.0
54,and it's not tied to a particular language!' L: Not translated adds an extra air of mystery.,1827280.0,1832159.0
54,G: Euro7pean scholars thought this was great. Francis Bacon thought this was amazing.,1832160.0,1843199.0
54,"It's interesting to see not just, okay, here's this thing that was going on in China at the time,",1843200.0,1847599.0
54,"which is interesting, but also, here's how these things get reflected and refracted,",1847600.0,1852959.0
54,whether that's the Europeans approaching Chinese grammar as maybe this is a thing that's universal,1852960.0,1857759.0
54,"or this Chinese grammarian, Mr Ma, looking at it and saying, 'Okay, how can I merge these two",1857760.0,1864079.0
54,"grammatical traditions of the full words versus the empty words?', and then also 'What if I have",1864080.0,1869279.0
54,"nouns and adjectives and stuff?', and 'How could I group them in ways that make sense for the",1869280.0,1874719.0
54,grammar of the language?' Everyone's bringing their own preconceived notions to this space.,1874720.0,1879519.0
54,L: I think the descriptive grammar has really figured itself out as a genre in the 20th Century.,1879520.0,1889359.0
54,A lot of the discussion around how to make sure people aren't just bringing,1889360.0,1893599.0
54,themselves to it has been to widen the scope of what gets included. One,1893600.0,1899599.0
54,"really big influence has been the idea that you need to have the grammar, but it has to",1899600.0,1905759.0
54,be presented alongside the wordlists because the grammar just tells you the rules not which words,1905760.0,1911439.0
54,go in which places and also a collection of texts that are broken down and translated so,1911440.0,1917999.0
54,that people can access what's happening in narratives. That solves a little bit,1918000.0,1921919.0
54,of that what gets included problem. G: Because somebody could always go,1921920.0,1926239.0
54,"back and look at the text again and say, 'Well, what if I interpreted them differently or wrote",1926240.0,1930719.0
54,this grammar differently based on what I can see here in this longer thing?',1930720.0,1934399.0
54,"L: Yeah. 'The author didn't get around to a section on the use of particles in narratives,",1934400.0,1940079.0
54,but there's enough texts here I can see what's happening.' This little trio of,1940080.0,1944639.0
54,"publications is sometimes known as the 'Boasian trinity,' which sounds a little bit more pompous",1944640.0,1950559.0
54,"and religious than it actually is, but it's part of this expanding what gets included.",1950560.0,1955039.0
54,"G: This is after Boas, whose first name I have forgotten.",1955040.0,1957919.0
54,L: Franz Boas. G: Franz? Franz Boas. He was,1957920.0,1961679.0
54,"one of the early grammarians in this descriptive and comparative tradition where it's not just,",1961680.0,1967039.0
54,"okay, every intellectual in this one country or this one society is devoting themselves to this",1967040.0,1973439.0
54,"one language but, 'Oh, what if we looked at lots of languages? What if we compared them?' This",1973440.0,1979519.0

54,"L: Yes, there's a lot of scientific rationalism happening here.",1984160.0,1988239.0
54,G: This is not entirely unproblematic either. It is interesting how the forms of the grammars,1988240.0,1995839.0
54,"start shifting when it stops being this sort of seeking this one language of like, 'Oh, everything",1995840.0,2002559.0

54,is the possibility space for what are different things that languages do?',2019920.0,2023679.0
54,"L: I mean, I think it's also worth pointing out a lot of 20th Century",2023680.0,2027439.0
54,language description has happened to try and translate religious texts and political,2027440.0,2034479.0
54,documents and that is a subset of problematic colonisation within the grammatical tradition.,2034480.0,2041439.0
54,"G: The longest text that's been written down in a lot of languages is the Bible, which has",2041440.0,2046799.0
54,all sorts of really weird consequences when you start using those parallel texts as the input for,2046800.0,2052399.0

54,"that Bible input, which is pretty weird. L: Such a weird consequence of a",2061040.0,2066399.0
54,weird set of earlier decisions. G: Exactly. Here was this earlier,2066400.0,2071519.0
54,"decision that maybe this was even a religious text that was created 100 years ago by some missionary,",2071520.0,2076719.0
54,"but it's the longest text that's available in this language, and the grammar is more or",2076720.0,2080799.0

54,"to introduce this foreign religion to them. L: Again, it's one of those things that is hard",2094080.0,2100079.0
54,to avoid and so it's just important to be aware of when you're looking at some grammars. They,2100080.0,2105439.0
54,may have a lot of Christian religious texts. It doesn't necessarily reflect the religion,2105440.0,2109999.0
54,of the speakers so much as the religion of the person doing the documentation.,2110000.0,2114319.0
54,G: Going back to that theme of grammars that are made by people and sometimes people's agendas,2114320.0,2120319.0
54,for making a grammar is -- L: A different endpoint.,2120320.0,2124639.0
54,"G: It's less about like, 'Oh, I want to help this language be taught in schools and",2124640.0,2129279.0
54,support its speakers in their own goals' and more,2129280.0,2131519.0
54,'I wanna impose my goals on the speakers.' L: I think another important change that has,2131520.0,2136559.0
54,happened across the 20th Century in terms of grammars is the increasing availability,2136560.0,2143439.0
54,"of recording equipment and, therefore, the ability to make recordings of the language",2143440.0,2149679.0

54,"these old, cracked wax cylinders, I think it was in the Smithsonian, and they couldn't put them on",2180080.0,2184159.0

54,"L: With recording technology, early on, and even for some linguists,",2212960.0,2217519.0
54,it's mostly about doing recordings so you can go back and listen yourself and really,2217520.0,2221759.0
54,identify that you're correctly analysing structures. But I think the more exciting thing,2221760.0,2226959.0
54,is that it lets you really observe more people using language in more natural ways. The 'Can,2226960.0,2233999.0
54,"you say this?', 'Can you say that?', 'Does that sound grammatical?' way of eliciting stuff",2234000.0,2239279.0

55,learning about English accents is how is it that in Canada we have this R and down in Australia,196320.0,203199.0
55,you don't have it. Where does that come from? L: It's a really nice example of how migration,203200.0,209279.0

55,L: It's made it a really attractive topic of study for linguists who are interested in the social,559520.0,565679.0
55,values that we apply to different accents. One thing I find particularly interesting in the,565680.0,571279.0
55,American context where this has been studied quite a lot is that it's not just a matter of,571280.0,577119.0
55,whether you have a rhotic accent or not. There are lots of people who can produce the rhotic accent,577120.0,583119.0
55,and do include that R at the end of words or might not depending on the social context and how,583120.0,588399.0
55,fancy they want to sound. Which means that we get to talk about probably one of the most,588400.0,592559.0
55,famous studies in English sociolinguistics. G: Yes. There is this very classic study,592560.0,597919.0
55,by Bill Labov who is an American sociolinguist. He went to three different levels of department,597920.0,604239.0
55,"stores -- one that was very fancy, one that was mid-level, and one that was",604240.0,608079.0
55,like a bargain basement store. You really get a feeling for the vintage department store vibe.,608080.0,613279.0
55,He found the location of something -- I think the women's shoe section is what he says in the paper,613280.0,618879.0
55,"-- that was already on the fourth floor. He would find it on the map, and then he would go up to",618880.0,623759.0
55,"sales keepers and say, 'Hey, can you tell me where to find the women's shoes?', and they would say,",623760.0,627599.0
55,"'fourth floor.' And he would say, 'Pardon me?' L: Or they would say, /fɑ:ð flɑː/.",627600.0,631839.0
55,"G: Yes, /fæːð flæ:/, in my bad imitation of a New York accent. He would say, 'Pardon me?', and then",631840.0,639839.0
55,"they would say it again, more distinctly. Then he would go around the corner, whip out his notebook,",639840.0,644319.0
55,and write down whether or not they said the R in both the first one -- the natural one -- and then,644320.0,648799.0
55,"the careful-er, more enunciated one afterwards. L: You could more or less map the fancier",648800.0,655279.0
55,"the department store, the more likely the salesperson was to use the rhotic R. If you asked",655280.0,663439.0
55,"someone to repeat something, it then becomes careful speech, where they're trying to be",663440.0,667359.0
55,"as articulate as possible, for whatever that means, and they're more likely to include an R",667360.0,673919.0
55,in that context as well. You see all these factors really elegantly. I think this study is attractive,673920.0,681199.0
55,because it's so elegant in how it was set up that people are more likely to use an R to sound fancy,681200.0,687439.0
55,"in New York in this context. It's been replicated over decades. People have moved more towards R,",687440.0,693919.0
55,and it's become the concrete standard of pronunciation.,693920.0,699279.0
55,"G: Also, I think it's just such a fun mental image of some guy with a notebook wandering around from",699280.0,704239.0
55,"department store to department store. When we were doing Crash Course Linguistics, one of the thought",704240.0,709839.0
55,"bubbles, which are little animated bits, we actually suggested, and they took our suggestion,",709840.0,714799.0
55,that they do a little animated Labov wandering from department store to department store. That's,714800.0,718399.0
55,a really cute animation that you can now watch. L: It also means that the concept of the fourth,718400.0,723119.0
55,floor has become a bit of a linguist in-joke. I am so pleased to say that my office at work,723120.0,730399.0

55,"delight in saying to each other, 'Which way to the conference?', 'Go to the FOURTH FLOOR.'",740880.0,744639.0
55,L: You could not have planned that better. G: It's also a bit of a meme in linguistics,744640.0,750879.0
55,that stuff happens on the fourth floor. It's a fairly salient thing about English,750880.0,754959.0
55,accents that they do different things with Rs. There's also downstream effects of what happens,754960.0,760639.0

55,"G: This gets us into this broader class of R-like sounds. Linguists talk about 'rhotics,' but if you",1427120.0,1434719.0

55,"And yet, when you're trying to actually put your finger on, 'Well, what makes them R-like?',",1455040.0,1458639.0
55,it becomes a way more complicated question. L: I guess one of the ones that is most,1458640.0,1463679.0
55,immediately noticeable because it's quite a fancy R is the /r/ in -- I learnt to pronounce trilled,1463680.0,1472079.0

55,I can kind of make it now because there was a really helpful YouTube video that I watched a,1514640.0,1519839.0
55,couple years ago after way too many years of trying and failing to produce this trilled,1519840.0,1525279.0
55,R with the tip of your tongue. It turned out the thing about the trilled R is that you have,1525280.0,1529599.0
55,to get a part of your mouth vibrating at such a fast speed that you don't have conscious control,1529600.0,1534159.0
55,over it. The way that you do that is you direct air in your mouth towards a place that's just a,1534160.0,1540559.0
55,little bit in front of where you actually want the vibration to happen. It's like blowing into,1540560.0,1544559.0
55,an instrument with a reed in it or blowing into a blade of grass between your fingers.,1544560.0,1548399.0

55,"R sound that the trill contrasts with is just a single tap. Instead of a repeated tapping motion,",1582720.0,1589519.0
55,it's just that single /pɛɾo/. One thing that is difficult about these R-like sounds that we're,1589520.0,1596479.0

55,"T in a word like /bʌɾə/ if we're just saying it very rapidly. It is an R-thing in Spanish,",1602800.0,1611279.0

57,For me it was a matter of bridging not only just a communication divide but also a cultural divide,115840.0,121919.0

58,G: This is my favourite type of linguistic terminology. Not all linguistics terminology,315360.0,319439.0

58,G: Yep. [Laughs] L:,425520.0,428159.0
58,"So, English has a /f/ in a word like 'fine,' and /v/ in a word like 'vine,'",428160.0,434399.0
58,but English hasn't always had a V of its own. G: You get these pairs in English of words like,434400.0,441439.0
58,"'knife/knives,' 'wolf/wolves,' 'leaf/leaves,' where you make it plural and then the F",441440.0,450959.0
58,"changes to V. This was this spelling thing that I had to learn as a kid in school,",450960.0,456639.0
58,but there're historical reasons for that. L: When a sound that doesn't have vibrations,456640.0,460639.0
58,"sits between two vowels, which are made with those vibrations, the efficient thing to do is",460640.0,466559.0
58,just keep the vibrations happening throughout that little string of sounds -- instead of 'leafs.',466560.0,473759.0
58,"G: The complicated thing here, right, is that when you write 'wolf/wolves' or 'leaf/leaves,'",473760.0,481279.0
58,"you change the F to a V and add E-S, which is the thing I learned in school. But you do",481280.0,486639.0
58,"that because at one point, first of all, the E was pronounced. It was like /lifəz/ or something like",486640.0,494239.0
58,that. Then that E that was pronounced changed the F to a V. Then we stopped pronouncing the,494240.0,500879.0
58,E -- the silent E -- but we kept the relic of it in the different pronunciation of the F as V.,500880.0,509759.0
58,L: This is not unique to English. This kind of sound change happens across languages quite often.,509760.0,517279.0
58,"That happened in the middle of words, but then the other thing that happened to English was French",517280.0,523199.0
58,"turned up, and French does have that V sound at the start of words as well. So, if an English",523200.0,528559.0
58,"word has a /v/ at the beginning, there's a very high chance that that was borrowed from French.",528560.0,533279.0
58,"G: Now, English has words like 'vine' and 'very' and things like that that got borrowed from",533280.0,537519.0
58,"languages like French and Latin that did have a V sound. So now, V feels like it has this full",537520.0,542719.0
58,"status in English as a sound you can use in a lot of different contexts, but it wasn't always",542720.0,547439.0
58,"like that. We have a few relics of that left in the writing system. Also, with pairs like",547440.0,551199.0
58,"'give' and 'gift,' where F and V sometimes make a pair. /f/ and /v/ are made with the lip and",551200.0,558639.0
58,"one part of the teeth, but you can actually make a fricative with both of the lips like /ɸ/ and /β/",558640.0,565199.0
58,"if you sort of try to make /p/ but just give them a little more space, you can make /ɸ/",565200.0,571119.0
58,"and /β/. This isn't found in English really, but it is found in other languages. They're found in",571120.0,575359.0
58,Spanish to some degree. These sounds sound quite a lot like either /b/ or /v/ or either /p/ or /f/.,575360.0,585599.0
58,"Sometimes, the languages just use them as variants of sounds they already have, and they don't make",585600.0,589279.0
58,"them stars of like, 'We're gonna make this sound carry a lot of meaning in this language.' They're",589280.0,596879.0
58,"found, but they're often found as sort of, I dunno, I wanna say like werewolves. They only show",596880.0,600879.0
58,"up in certain contexts when there's a full moon. L: A little bit like our Old English V, which only",600880.0,606559.0
58,popped up in the middle of words towards the end of the -- and it wasn't everywhere all the time.,606560.0,612239.0
58,"G: Exactly. Sometimes, you have sounds that can show up in a language but not be particularly",612240.0,616719.0
58,important for making entirely new words. L: If we move our attention further back,616720.0,621679.0
58,"in the mouth rather than further forward, we end up at the sounds -- because there are",621680.0,627119.0
58,more than one in English -- /θ/ and /ð/. G: These are the sounds like in 'bath' and,627120.0,632319.0
58,"'bathe,' or in 'either' and 'ether.' L: Oh, that's a good pair.",632320.0,637279.0
58,G: Yeah. Or in 'wreath' and 'wreathe.' L: We don't often pay attention to them,637280.0,642879.0
58,"because they get written in English with the same T-H combination, but they're actually two",642880.0,647839.0
58,"different sounds -- one involves vibration of the vocal cords, and one doesn't.",647840.0,652079.0
58,G: This vocal cord vibration theme just keeps coming up because especially in English with the,652080.0,658079.0
58,"history of fricatives /bæθ/ and /bɛɪð/, /ɹiθ/ and /ɹið/, /bɹɛθ/ and /bɹið/ -- they were also sort of",658080.0,665279.0
58,pairs where one of them had a vowel after them. That version of the T-H -- which there are two,665280.0,672399.0
58,T-H sounds -- was between two vowels just like the F was between two vowels and became V and the /θ/,672400.0,678799.0
58,"in between two vowels became /ð/, which is also getting that here's your vocal cords vibrating",678800.0,684799.0
58,again because you're between two vowels. This is a thing that happens specifically,684800.0,688959.0
58,"in English fricatives, although it's not uncommon across other languages as well.",688960.0,692639.0
58,L: I sometimes wonder if we would pay more attention to the difference between /θ/ and /ð/,692640.0,698399.0
58,if we had different symbols for them. English used to before the printing press ruined everything.,698400.0,707999.0
58,"G: I mean, Icelandic still has a symbol for the /ð/ sound, which is this circle with a",708000.0,715359.0
58,"line in a cross above it, which is called 'eth.' This is available in other languages.",715360.0,721519.0
58,It's just not a thing that printing presses from continental Europe had. Because French,721520.0,727279.0
58,doesn't have this sound. Dutch doesn't have this sound. That's where they were importing printing,727280.0,731519.0
58,"presses from. They didn't have a symbol for this sound, so they were like, 'Oh, I guess we could",731520.0,735999.0
58,just do something else with it instead.' L: Whereas the English Runic system used,736000.0,739759.0
58,"to have 'thorn,' which looked like a little thorn on a branch and, I mean,",739760.0,745999.0
58,meant 'thorn' as well but was used for this sound. It was an attempt to use Y to represent that,746000.0,753119.0
58,really lazily in old printing which is why 'the olde tea shop' looks like 'ye olde tea shop.',753120.0,760479.0
58,G: It was actually them just trying to pronounce 'the olde tea shop' and use a different letter for,760480.0,766079.0
58,"it. So, if you ever see that on a ren faire sign, you know what it is from now. The one",766080.0,771199.0
58,that they ended up sticking with was using a T-H for both of them. There really would've been an,771200.0,775199.0
58,"argument to use T-H and D-H for them, it's just that the /ð/ sound is not super common in English",775200.0,782159.0
58,even still because we didn't have a source like French bringing us a whole bunch of /ð/ words the,782160.0,786959.0
58,"way French brought us a bunch of V words. It's found in some words, but a lot of them you can",786960.0,793279.0
58,tell which one it's gonna be based on context. L: These two sounds are not particularly common,793280.0,798159.0
58,"across the world's languages. But the most prevalent fricative -- in fact,",798160.0,802239.0
58,one of the most prevalent sounds that you'll find across different languages of,802240.0,805599.0
58,"the world is -- once again, moving a little bit further back in our mouths -- the sound /s/.",805600.0,810799.0
58,G: Yes. The glorious S. L: Satisfyingly common.,810800.0,816719.0
58,G: 'Satisfyingly sneaky' I was hoping you were going to say.,816720.0,820159.0
58,L: There is a high saturation of S. It's found in around 70% of the world's languages.,820160.0,827839.0
58,G: I have a fun story about the letter S versus the sound S.,827840.0,832959.0
58,"L: Oh, yeah, that's always good to separate out the writing system",832960.0,837919.0
58,and the sounds that are actually used. G: It's really messed up. The way that I,837920.0,843039.0
58,know this is because when I was an undergraduate linguistics student with time on my hands and,843040.0,848159.0
58,"other linguistic student friends with times on their hands, we made a Scrabble set",848160.0,854479.0
58,"with International Phonetic Alphabet tiles. L: Ooo! So, you make words, but instead of",854480.0,861199.0
58,"spelling them out, you pronounce them out using the International Phonetic Alphabet.",861200.0,865439.0
58,G: Exactly. It's kind of complicated because you can't just take all the English alphabet letters,865440.0,872239.0
58,and write their International Phonetic Alphabet version because the distribution of tiles in a,872240.0,876399.0
58,"Scrabble set is like you have a lot of Es, and you only have one Z, and you only have one Q,",876400.0,881119.0
58,and stuff like this. You need to figure out what's really common and what's really rare,881120.0,885679.0
58,and decide both how many of them to put in the game and also what point value to give them.,885680.0,891119.0
58,"This changes a lot of things. By the way, I do actually have -- one of the very first blog posts",891120.0,895919.0
58,that I made on my blog was from a couple years earlier this list of IPA Scrabble frequencies.,895920.0,902639.0
58,There's a tiny spreadsheet you can download that has the frequencies and how you can make your own,902640.0,907279.0

58,"You can totally do this. Some people have and sent me photos, which is amazing. I have a link to how",912720.0,918239.0
58,to do this for yourself if this is a thing you need in your life now. But playing IPA Scrabble,918240.0,924879.0
58,is also a super interesting experience because almost the thing that was weird about it was,924880.0,931119.0
58,not just what letters are surprisingly hard and they're rare -- that's how I learned that,931120.0,935599.0
58,it's really hard to play 'the' in IPA Scrabble because it's a really high-value letter that,935600.0,940959.0
58,"isn't found in a ton of words -- but also, letters that you would expect would be easy are sometimes",940960.0,947199.0
58,actually surprisingly hard. One of those is S. L: Okay. Because our letter S doesn't always,947200.0,953999.0
58,represent us saying the sound /s/. G: Exactly. The letter S in the,954000.0,960239.0
58,"English orthography, sometimes it's combined with an H, but that makes a /ʃ/",960240.0,965359.0
58,sound. That's a different tile in IPA Scrabble. You have a /ʃ/ tile and you have a /s/ tile.,965360.0,972639.0
58,"This is in words like 'sea' -- okay, there's your S making an S sound -- but then in 'she,' you'd spell",972640.0,979119.0
58,this in IPA Scrabble as a /ʃ/ plus an /i/. L: Because in English we use S-H to,979120.0,984799.0
58,represent that /ʃ/ sound. G: Right. There's a source of,984800.0,989039.0
58,"Ss that you can no longer play. L: Oh, there's so many /ʃ/ words.",989040.0,993119.0
58,"G: Right! Sometimes, an S makes a /ʃ/ sound, and you don't even have",993120.0,998159.0
58,"an H there. A word like 'sure,' again, 'sir' -- well, that's a word in English,",998160.0,1002799.0

58,L: That's what I always find really interesting about the values that we attach to these sounds,1635440.0,1640319.0
58,that are produced similarly. It's just the context that they're produced in,1640320.0,1645599.0

58,as applied to a language. It doesn't have a linguistically defined meaning. It generally,1665093.0,1668239.0
58,just means 'I'm going to be kind of racist now.' L: I should say that I specifically find the way,1668240.0,1673759.0

58,is a really good way to start trying to step back from those knee-jerk reactions you have.,1686960.0,1693199.0
58,G: Exactly. The other fun fact about the fricative that's in this sort of C/K/G position is that,1693200.0,1702719.0
58,it's sort of a ghost sound in English. L: Okay. Because of the 'loch' situation,1702720.0,1710559.0
58,"in Scottish English? G: Not only that,",1710560.0,1713119.0
58,but this is actually the sound that in English used to be represented with the sequence G-H.,1713120.0,1719199.0
58,This is in words like 'knight' or 'laugh' or 'enough' or also,1719200.0,1724479.0
58,"a certain person's surname who you may have met. L: Oh, yeah, your surname, Gretchen McCullough.",1724480.0,1730799.0
58,G: Thank you. Sometimes it gets represented as G-H. There are other people who have the,1730800.0,1735279.0
58,O-U-G-H spelling of my surname. Mine is spelled O-C-H. Because in modern English it often gets,1735280.0,1740799.0
58,approximated with C-H or maybe K-H. But historically in English it was written,1740800.0,1744719.0
58,with G-H. This is why you get G-H making all of these different sounds in English,1744720.0,1752399.0
58,because in words like 'laugh' and 'cough' it got made into a different fricative.,1752400.0,1760079.0

58,through other paths as well. G: And sometimes it just went,1772160.0,1775359.0
58,"to zero. You have like 'through' and 'though' and 'knight' and 'light,' and that just became",1775360.0,1781439.0
58,silent and maybe affected the sound of the vowel next to it. Then in some cases it became like a K,1781440.0,1786079.0
58,like in the way I say my name /məkələk/ or in modern-day Anglicisations of /lak/ or /bak/ which,1786080.0,1792479.0
58,is how you get a lot of English speakers saying those words if they're not super comfortable,1792480.0,1795199.0

58,while English you speak. I honestly think /hɛɪt͡ʃ/ is more logical -- I just didn't grow up with,1849440.0,1854639.0
58,it -- because it actually has the name of the sound in it. This one is interesting in English because,1854640.0,1860559.0
58,it's also super hard to play in IPA Scrabble. L: Because words that we think have H in,1860560.0,1867519.0

58,exactly the reason that we have names like 'Sarah' and 'Hannah' that are often spelt with a H. They,1942640.0,1948639.0
58,don't have to be because those sounds aren't pronounced in English -- those Hs at the end,1948640.0,1953999.0

63,L: Okay. G: The first,76560.0,78799.0
63,"set of words is 'pasta,' 'paste,' 'pesto.' Are any of these words related? If so, which ones?",78800.0,85839.0
63,"L: I'm very observant, so I notice they all start with a P, and they have a similar",85840.0,91039.0
63,shape to them. I like pasta and pesto in combination. I don't think that has anything,91040.0,97519.0

63,"your personal aesthetic judgements interfere with your search for etymological truth, yes.",102560.0,106399.0

63,things that you mash stuff up in. I'm gonna say 'paste' and 'pesto' are related. Then,115120.0,122799.0
63,'pasta' has me completely stumped in this one because I feel like I could make up some reason,122800.0,129839.0
63,"there's a relationship to do with how pasta is like a goopy dough that you cook, but I feel like",129840.0,138319.0
63,I'm definitely just inventing connections between these words at this point. I'll say 'paste' and,138320.0,144319.0

63,"L: Oh, no! That's okay. G: Interestingly,",150800.0,155039.0
63,'pasta' and 'paste' are actually related. 'Pasta' comes via Italian after World War II,155040.0,161919.0
63,"because a lot of English speakers were in Italy at the time from Late Latin 'pasta' meaning 'dough,",161920.0,166799.0
63,"pastry cake' or 'paste,' from Greek 'pasta' meaning ''barley porridge,' probably originally",166800.0,172319.0
63,"'a salted mess of food,'' from the neutral plural of 'pastos,' meaning 'sprinkled or salted,'",172320.0,177919.0
63,"from the Proto-Indo-European root '*kwet-,' 'to shake,' which is also a root for 'quash.'",177920.0,184159.0
63,"'Paste' was originally 'dough for the making of bread or pastry,' also coming from Old French",184160.0,189679.0
63,"'paste' meaning 'dough' or 'pastry,' which became Modern French 'pâte' and also related to 'pâté.'",189680.0,195999.0
63,"L: I was right to guess the smooshy relationship between those two, but that means",196000.0,201359.0
63,that there's no relationship with 'pesto.' G: There's no relationship with 'pesto.',201360.0,205519.0
63,"The thing they have in common is this pureed nature. I was thinking, oh, man,",205520.0,209119.0
63,this seems like 'pesto' should be part of this family as well because there's a bunch,209120.0,212079.0
63,"of stuff in there. But 'pesto' is also from Italian 'pesto,' contracted form of 'pestato,'",212080.0,218479.0

63,"as it's gone through history in its meaning, compared to 'pasta' which goes all the way",250560.0,254959.0
63,back to something that meant 'sprinkle.' G: Exactly. This 'crush' meaning -- I guess,254960.0,259679.0
63,people have been crushing things for a long time in history and has,259680.0,262799.0
63,"had less of a shift when it goes along there. I mean, you can remember this because 'pasta' and",262800.0,267519.0
63,'paste' both have an A in the first vowel. But changing an A to an E is not necessarily a big,267520.0,273119.0

63,"there're all these interesting connections. L: I have another food-related one for you,",285360.0,289919.0

63,"other people have as 'macaroon.' L: Yeah, it's like a coconut-y,",304000.0,307199.0
63,dough-y biscuit thing. G: And then a 'macaron' is,307200.0,310079.0
63,the fancy one that has the two layers with the meringue sides. Then 'macaroni' is the pasta.,310080.0,317999.0
63,Okay. I want 'macaroon' and 'macaron' is be related because they're both sweet,318000.0,322639.0

63,"and crushing it to create this food. G: Oh, is that like to 'macerate'?",370080.0,373119.0
63,L: I guess so. I don't actually know. I'm gonna look that up now.,373120.0,376079.0
63,"G: I feel like there's a lot of like, 'Oh, I wonder if that's related to this' when it",376080.0,380239.0
63,comes to etymology. There's also the sort of pause-and-look-it-up step just to be sure.,380240.0,385359.0
63,L: According to Etymonline -- and I feel like that's a thing we're gonna say a lot this episode,385360.0,389759.0
63,"-- no, Latin is where we get 'maceration' from, and that is 'steeping or soaking something to",389760.0,396479.0
63,make it soft or tender.' G: Which is not quite,396480.0,398559.0
63,the same thing as 'crushing.' L: They sound similar but different histories.,398560.0,401919.0
63,G: Different histories. Etymonline is great. Shout out to Etymonline. It's a free website,401920.0,406399.0
63,where you can look up etymologies. They compile a bunch of different sources that,406400.0,410479.0
63,"are potentially locked behind pay walls -- but they're very legit sources, they're just harder",410480.0,413999.0
63,"to access -- and make them very convenient to find. L: Also, those examples help make clear what it",414000.0,419199.0
63,is that makes words related. Those etymologies are the histories of words and where they've come from,419200.0,424399.0
63,"if we trace them back through time. Some words trace back to the same point, like 'pasta' and",424400.0,430799.0
63,"'paste,' and others trace back to other histories, like 'pestle' or 'macerate' and 'macaroni.'",430800.0,437119.0
63,G: I think it's really worth pointing out that just because two words resemble each other doesn't,437120.0,441039.0
63,"mean they have this common ancestry. Sometimes I meet somebody who's got the same hair as me,",441040.0,447359.0
63,"and I'm like, 'Oh my god, you have dark, curly hair just like me!' But that doesn't mean that",447360.0,451199.0
63,"they're my long-lost cousin, long-time removed. There are multiple avenues to arrive at dark,",451200.0,458719.0
63,curly hair. There're multiple avenues to arrive at something like an M-A-C sequence at the beginning,458720.0,464879.0
63,of a word. You can end up with these convergent points where it seems like words resemble each,464880.0,469599.0
63,"other. Sometimes, you can end up with histories that make a word look quite different in many",469600.0,474399.0
63,"steps along its way. As long as you can actually trace each of those steps, it's the history that",474400.0,479599.0
63,"makes the etymology. It's not just looking at two words in the present day and being like, 'These",479600.0,484479.0
63,look like each other. I bet they're related.' Wondering if they're related is the fun bit where,484480.0,489839.0
63,"etymological investigation begins, but it needs to have that link to history because that's what",489840.0,493999.0
63,makes it more than just free association. L: Like the words 'cook' and 'cookie.',494000.0,498479.0
63,"G: Oh my god. 'Cook' and 'cookie.' I really, really feel like these should be related. But",498480.0,503679.0
63,"you told me they weren't. I went and looked it up in Etymonline, and then I didn't believe",503680.0,507839.0
63,"them either, and I looked it up in the Oxford English Dictionary, and they're not related.",507840.0,511999.0
63,L: I really appreciate that you went and verified my anecdote from two sources before,512000.0,517999.0
63,"you would believe me on that. They're not related. G: 'Cookie' comes from Dutch, from 'koekje,' which",518000.0,525839.0
63,is a diminutive of 'cake.' It is actually related to Modern English 'cake.' I guess a 'cookie' is a,525840.0,530879.0
63,little cake. They're not related to 'cook.' You don't cook a cookie. The Oxford English,530880.0,536159.0
63,"Dictionary actually has a note in it that's like, 'They're not related,' which they don't",536160.0,540079.0
63,do very often. I think it's because it'd be so tempting to think that 'cook' and 'cookie' were.,540080.0,544639.0
63,L: I think the fact that you had to go look this up to believe me is a really great reminder that,544640.0,549839.0
63,"linguists don't actually know etymologies. It's something that we might hear them as stories, or",549840.0,557999.0
63,we might research them. I am always pulling out my phone when people talk about etymologies or ask me,558000.0,563359.0
63,"etymology questions. I'm bringing up Etymonline, and I'm checking. Even if I think I know,",563360.0,568319.0
63,sometimes I forget because you just wanna believe that these two words are related to each other.,568320.0,572799.0
63,"G: I mean, you say this, but also, of the linguists who know some etymologies,",572800.0,577439.0
63,"you wrote an etymology column for By Lingo for, like, five years, ten years.",577440.0,581599.0
63,L: I wrote a story every two weeks about the history of an English word. It was a really,581600.0,587999.0
63,great opportunity to use those sources like the Oxford English Dictionary and Etymonline,588000.0,592799.0
63,to tell these stories like 'cook' and 'cookie' not being related. Another one is 'pest' and 'pester',592800.0,599199.0
63,come from completely different sources. G: This is not related to the 'pesto',599200.0,603039.0
63,"thing. This is 'pest' and 'pester.' L: 'Pest' and 'pester' are not related,",603040.0,606479.0
63,"and they're also not related to 'pesto.' G: Ah, man. I buy the 'pesto' thing,",606480.0,611599.0
63,"but I really want 'pest' and 'pester' to be related. And yet, history says no.",611600.0,616639.0
63,L: You get these convergent mergings or parallels between words like 'cook' and 'cookie.' Even,616640.0,623439.0
63,"though we can trace back the histories of words, sometimes they're influencing each other as well.",623440.0,627999.0
63,G: Like 'cookie' is not spelled the same way that it was in Dutch when it was being borrowed. In,628000.0,631839.0
63,"Dutch, it was spelled with a K, and they do different things with the vowels and so on.",631840.0,635919.0
63,"Possibly the way it was spelled in English may have been influenced by the word 'cook,' but",635920.0,639839.0
63,that's a post hoc thing that doesn't actually relate to where the words came from originally.,639840.0,645999.0
63,L: That's why you need that meticulous working back through history. It's also why for some words,646000.0,651039.0
63,we just don't necessarily know where they come from because we can't follow them back,651040.0,656239.0
63,in the written record or the relationship between languages,656240.0,660399.0
63,to get back to whether it comes from a German language or whether it comes from Latin.,660400.0,665279.0
63,There's these points in historical record where you can't trace them any further.,665280.0,669279.0
63,"G: It's really tempting to be like, oh, 'etymology unknown' and be like, 'I could know something.'",669280.0,674319.0
63,But it's not 'knowing' at that point. It's speculating or making things up or something like,674320.0,679279.0
63,that. Etymologists go to a lot of effort to look at sources and texts and records of stuff that was,679280.0,686319.0
63,"going on in other languages, stuff that was being borrowed in, records from travellers, records from",686320.0,691279.0
63,"immigrants, records from people who had contact with other languages and where words might've come",691280.0,695359.0
63,"from. Sometimes they do encounter, oh, here's this source that actually dates a word back ten years",695360.0,701519.0
63,"earlier than we thought we had, which was very exciting in Etymology-land. It's not the kind of",701520.0,706959.0
63,thing that an average person or even a relatively well-trained linguist like you or I can just sit,706960.0,713039.0
63,down and do for ourselves. We're reporting on stuff that other people have done for us.,713040.0,717279.0
63,"L: I think especially for a language like English and a lot of the other major European languages,",717280.0,722959.0
63,"when it says 'unknown,' a lot of people have put a lot of time in to be able to say that. It's",722960.0,729039.0
63,"relatively conclusive. You can trace etymologies back for all of the world's languages because,",729040.0,734479.0
63,"if you think about it going forward, we're always thinking of new ways of using words,",734480.0,739119.0
63,"or extensions, or using them metaphorically that changes their use. For smaller languages,",739120.0,746239.0
63,all of those stories might not have been put together yet. For a language like English that,746240.0,750959.0
63,"has such an extensive written record and has been so extensively researched, if they say",750960.0,755919.0
63,the etymology is 'unknown' for a word like 'dog' -- 'dog' isn't in related languages.,755920.0,760639.0
63,We don't know where it came from in English. I feel like I can trust the researchers on,760640.0,766479.0
63,this because there has been so much research. G: If somebody had a compelling story for where,766480.0,771199.0
63,"'dog' came from that was actually attested by the record, that would be, again, etymological",771200.0,777519.0
63,news and would've been put somewhere. Whereas if a language has been less well-documented -- and I,777520.0,782079.0
63,think that's something that is interesting about etymology is a lot of the early citations for,782080.0,787199.0
63,etymologies were Shakespeare. That's not always just because Shakespeare came up with a bunch,787200.0,792639.0
63,"of these words. I mean, he probably came up with some, but it was also because when etymologists",792640.0,797999.0
63,"were working from, in the very early stages, whatever written text they had, the written",798000.0,804239.0
63,"text that everybody had was a complete work of Shakespeare and the King James Bible. It's like,",804240.0,808479.0
63,"well, we know it's at least as old as Shakespeare, but maybe there was a more obscure writer who was",808480.0,813439.0
63,also using it in private correspondence a few decades or a few centuries earlier. Some of the,813440.0,819039.0
63,early etymology work put words at least as old as Shakespeare because that's what people had access,819040.0,823999.0
63,to in terms of records. It doesn't necessarily mean that Shakespeare coined every single word,824000.0,828159.0
63,that he's cited to have coined. L: It's just a handy,828160.0,832079.0
63,point in history that we have a record of. G: Early etymology research -- and still older,832080.0,838399.0
63,"etymology research -- is very paper-based, very text-based. You can't just, like, 'Oh,",838400.0,842639.0

65,"G: Exactly. Something that's interesting about the copula forms in, at least, a lot of European",477680.0,482479.0
65,languages is that they are often historically drawing some forms from one verb and some forms,482480.0,488399.0

66,an implausible thing that I can conclude from this set of words.,309760.0,313599.0
66,Some of the things that having grammar lets us do is communicate these types of scenarios where,313600.0,319919.0
66,you genuinely could have either of us in either order -- either of us could be doing the visiting,319920.0,325039.0
66,here -- or communicate surprising things or interesting things. I think the classic example is,325040.0,331359.0
66,"like, 'A dog bites a man' is not a news headline, but 'A man bites a dog' is a news headline.",331360.0,337599.0
66,"I'd like to think about it in terms of killer chocolate, you know. 'The chocolate eats me' -- you",337600.0,342399.0
66,"can actually communicate surprising or fantastical or curious things because grammar exists,",342400.0,348559.0
66,and we're not just reliant on determining what the most sensible or logical meaning,348560.0,352879.0
66,is based on the actual meanings of the words. L: There was actually a study that looked at,352880.0,356719.0
66,"this in 30 different languages and found that for those examples like, 'I eat chocolate,' where it's",356720.0,363759.0
66,"really obvious, people would actually be able to guess even without any of the grammar available.",363760.0,370079.0
66,"But for that 10-15% of sentences where it wasn't clear because it was two equal status things like,",370080.0,377919.0
66,"'Lauren and Gretchen,' who's doing what, or where it was examples like,",377920.0,381839.0
66,"'Man bites dog,' which are surprising to us. Grammar is so important whether",381840.0,387599.0
66,that's putting things in a particular order or tagging things or some combination of that.,387600.0,392399.0
66,G: 10-15% of sentences that are actually confusing if you don't know the grammar and you're only,392400.0,397759.0
66,"paying attention to the meanings of the words -- it might not seem like a lot, but it's enough that",397760.0,401519.0
66,-- I think every language we've been encountered with has some way of distinguishing between these,401520.0,405919.0
66,two types of entities because they're often important things to be able to communicate,405920.0,409679.0
66,such as things that are happening between two people or things that are happening,409680.0,413199.0
66,"that are surprising that you aren't expecting or fantastical or storytelling, things like that.",413200.0,418479.0
66,"This is not the majority of things you do with a sentence, but it's a really important",418480.0,422719.0
66,sub-case of things you do with a sentence. L: A good quantification of just how frequently we,422720.0,428719.0
66,really do need grammar to make things make sense. G: Yeah. Studies like this are interesting because,428720.0,435039.0
66,they tend to look at this very simplified version of what a sentence is. It's got a,435040.0,440559.0
66,subject -- that's 'me.' It's got the verb -- that's 'eat.' It's got the object -- that's 'chocolate.',440560.0,445999.0
66,That's a very simple sentence. Many of the sentences that we say in conversation are,446000.0,451119.0
66,not that simple. They're doing other things. They're in a chain of sentences where you have,451120.0,455919.0
66,the same person who's carrying through the entire story. You have other stuff going on.,455920.0,461039.0
66,We look at this very stylised representation of this 'I eat chocolate'/ 'Gretchen visits Lauren',461040.0,466159.0
66,"type sentence which is very simplified. Sometimes there's extra, additional complexities going on",466160.0,472159.0
66,once you start talking about things that are happening in conversation or in more complicated,472160.0,476799.0
66,sentences or in poetry or writing or other types of contexts where other stuff can happen. The one,476800.0,482639.0
66,"that I think of is -- so English, okay, it goes subject-verb-object. That seems really clear.",482640.0,488079.0
66,"But then you can say something like, 'Chocolate, I like, but chips, I can really take or leave them.'",488080.0,495759.0
66,"Now you have 'Chocolate, I like,' and that's object and then the subject and",495760.0,500239.0
66,"then the verb. As soon as you start looking at things in context, there's",500240.0,504479.0
66,already places where it begins to break down. L: Different languages will have different places,504480.0,509119.0
66,that that breaks down or different things that they tend to do. This is why this concept of word,509120.0,514559.0
66,order is something that gets paid attention to and that we look at across different languages.,514560.0,519999.0
66,"G: While we're talking about word order -- because there are tendencies that languages have, whether",520000.0,524559.0
66,stronger or weaker tendencies -- it's also just as valid to mark who's doing what to who by tagging,524560.0,533039.0
66,each of the words with what its role is in the sentence. This is sometimes traditionally talked,533040.0,537759.0
66,"about as 'case marking,' but I like to think of it as adding a tag or -- do you want a metaphor?",537760.0,542799.0
66,L: Sure. G: You can think about it as sort of like,542800.0,545679.0
66,different ways to organise your desk. L: Okay.,545680.0,549119.0
66,G: If you've got a bunch of different papers that belong to some of the different courses,549120.0,553199.0
66,"that you teach, how would you organise those? L: I'd like to have them in piles. I sometimes",553200.0,561039.0
66,like those little desk sorters that have the little stackers that let me,561040.0,564959.0
66,"put different things in different places. If I'm teaching Intro to Linguistics,",564960.0,568799.0
66,I'll have it one pile here. And then I'll have my pile of papers for Syntax sitting next to it.,568800.0,574159.0
66,"G: Right. Another thing you could do, which I do a lot, is colour-code things. You could say,",574160.0,578719.0
66,"okay, all the red ones are gonna be intro linguistics. I'm gonna use this colour",578720.0,583999.0
66,"Post-it note, or I'm gonna use this colour pen, or this colour highlighter, this colour binder,",584000.0,587839.0

66,"L: I like a bit of colour-coding, but I really need to know where things are.",592320.0,596319.0
66,G: I think of the colour-coding as like adding on this tag that tells each word what its role,596320.0,602959.0
66,is in the sentence and the 'Let's put things in different piles' as 'Let's use word order,602960.0,607999.0
66,to tell what thing's going on here.' L: It's important to say neither is,608000.0,612159.0
66,better or worse. They're just different strategies for figuring out where things are,612160.0,617199.0
66,just the same when it comes to tagging or word order for sentence structure.,617200.0,622559.0
66,"G: Exactly. It's something that's interesting when you start looking at human languages is,",622560.0,626719.0
66,"in principle, any order of subject and verb and object would work just as well for -- as long as",626720.0,634399.0
66,"everybody agrees, you know who's doing what to who. You could put the object at the beginning.",634400.0,638959.0
66,You could put the verb in the middle and the subject at the end.,638960.0,643039.0
66,"Like, 'Chocolate like I' -- you're not really confused about what's going on here. I mean, it",643040.0,647439.0
66,"would mean that 'Gretchen visits Lauren' actually means 'Lauren visits Gretchen,' but that's only",647440.0,651439.0
66,"confusing because we're doing with our English brain on. In principle, as long as we all agree,",651440.0,655199.0
66,"we could do it in that order, too. This is where looking at a whole bunch of languages is really",655200.0,659439.0
66,"interesting because if each of these orders was just a random bit of consensus, you might expect",659440.0,666799.0
66,"that like, okay, there're six possible orders, a group of languages would be about a sixth with",666800.0,671839.0
66,each of these. But that's not what we see. L: It's not a random roll of the dice when,671840.0,674959.0
66,it comes to word order. We find that there are some that are more common than others.,674960.0,679199.0
66,I think the biggest overall tendency is that the subject tends to come before the object.,679200.0,685679.0

66,"of these show up relatively commonly, especially those cases where you have the verb between the",754640.0,759439.0
66,subject and the object or the verb at the end. There's still quite a few languages that do verb,759440.0,764079.0

66,on here. One of them is that German really likes to have the verb in the second position of the,1514240.0,1520399.0
66,sentence no matter what else is around it. L: Okay. 'I love chocolate' -- it looks like,1520400.0,1526959.0
66,"an English word order, but it's actually a I'm-the-verb-and-I'm-second order.",1526960.0,1531759.0

66,"'Yesterday, ate I chocolate' is maybe not a particularly typical English sentence,",1538400.0,1541999.0
66,"but you can say in English something like, 'Often have I wandered the fields of gold.'",1542000.0,1546559.0
66,"L: I mean, if we were keeping in the theme of this episode, it would be,",1546560.0,1551039.0
66,"'Often have I wandered the fields of chocolate,' but your point still stands. It feels like,",1551040.0,1557919.0
66,"as you say, a very poetic way of speaking, but it doesn't feel like it's not grammatical for me.",1557920.0,1563679.0

66,sentence. What's really going on is you need to put one part of the verb in the second position,1580560.0,1585119.0
66,and then everything else in the verb goes at the end. I can see why in a map like WALS you would,1585120.0,1590399.0
66,"just sort of, okay, we're gonna give German a grey dot and say, 'no dominant word order' because",1590400.0,1594559.0
66,there's actually this complicated thing where the verb goes at the end except for all the times,1594560.0,1598239.0
66,when it shows up in second position. You can't represent that in a dot compared to all of the,1598240.0,1603119.0

66,"which is like 14% -- nearly 200 languages -- in this dataset that have no dominant order,",1608080.0,1614319.0
66,"has some sort of story, probably, in terms of what that actually looks like",1614320.0,1618479.0
66,when you're going down and seeing what that is. L: That German story of there being two main,1618480.0,1625199.0
66,ways of doing things is very different to the Latin story where Latin uses that tagging case,1625200.0,1632719.0
66,marking system and therefore is even more flexible in terms of the order that these words can go in.,1632720.0,1639199.0
66,"G: When I was studying Latin, I would sometimes be asked to translate something that was from",1639200.0,1644479.0
66,"poetry or something. The subject would be on one line, and the verb's on another line,",1644480.0,1649119.0
66,and the only way you can tell that they're related to each other is because of the endings that,1649120.0,1653599.0
66,"they have. This can be used for poetic effect, and you can do all sorts of interesting things",1653600.0,1658559.0
66,"with metre and with rhythm and which sounds are next to each other for artistic effect,",1658560.0,1663999.0
66,but because you can recover this information -- that's got one thing going on. Latin has,1664000.0,1671199.0
66,"tendencies in ordinary writing, especially prose where the verb often goes at the end -- but",1671200.0,1677679.0
66,it's very much off and very fudgeable. L: I imagine in spoken Latin at lot of those,1677680.0,1687039.0
66,putting-the-thing-that-I-want-you-to-pay-attention-to-at-the-front,1687040.0,1689839.0
66,tendencies tend to be stronger. It must be a bit of a relief as a student that you're generally,1689840.0,1695039.0
66,"dealing with written Latin poetry, so you have the time to put together those bits that should",1695040.0,1699999.0
66,"be and have been split up for poetic reasons. G: Unfortunately, you're not on the streets of",1700000.0,1705519.0
66,Rome trying to ask Caesar where the library is or something like that.,1705520.0,1708479.0
66,L: It's really interesting that Latin and French contrast in this way where the formal Latin has,1708480.0,1714559.0
66,"the more flexible word order in terms of usage. G: Oh, yeah, that's true. I mean, they're related",1714560.0,1720719.0
66,to each other. I think word order is the kind of thing that sometimes captures people's attention,1720720.0,1726159.0
66,because even languages that are related to each other sometimes end up acquiring different word,1726160.0,1730959.0
66,orders -- even relatively related languages. L: You really have to take a language-specific,1730960.0,1736399.0
66,approach to word order and what's influencing it. We've discussed a variety of ways that word,1736400.0,1743039.0
66,order gets influenced. Another one that I really like is when you have to look at the animacy of,1743040.0,1749119.0
66,the things that are involved in the sentence. This happens in quite a few languages. Sesotho is one,1749120.0,1755919.0
66,"that I have an example for, for you. G: Ooo, yes, please show it to me.",1755920.0,1759519.0
66,"L: If you say, 'I cooked food for the child,' the word order has to be 'I cooked",1759520.0,1766479.0
66,"child food' because the child is animate. But if you have something like,",1766480.0,1772479.0
66,"'I cooked food for the feast,' the feast is not animate. The word order can be more flexible,",1772480.0,1777519.0
66,and 'feast' can come before or after 'food' -- so 'I cooked feast food' or 'I cooked food feast',1777520.0,1784079.0
66,"as a literal translation. Either of them work. But for an animate object, it changes the restrictions",1784080.0,1792079.0
66,that you have in terms of word order. G: That's neat. There's all sorts of factors that,1792080.0,1795839.0
66,you can use whether it's French 'Is this a pronoun or not?' or 'Is this animate or not?' It's also,1795840.0,1802239.0
66,not every factor that you could possibly conceive of. There seem to be some that languages converge,1802240.0,1806959.0
66,"around, which probably has something to do with which things people find interesting or worth",1806960.0,1811039.0
66,"talking about. Because of this additional level of complexity when it comes to word order, there's",1811040.0,1816879.0

66,that has proportion of the order where the subject goes first. That's the 'I chocolate' order.,1846960.0,1854399.0
66,"Way up at the top at virtually 100% is Indonesian, and then French,",1854400.0,1860319.0

67,where official state-sponsored bilingualism is English and French. She's made great pains,666240.0,672159.0
67,to point out that she started learning French since she started holding office,672160.0,675519.0
67,"and that she respects the French and so on and so forth because this is this political football,",675520.0,681199.0

67,"English or French as suits them, but as soon as she steps into this official role, she's",707920.0,712159.0

67,"help out with that career. It depends on the political party, it depends on the particular",733840.0,736719.0

67,"that are interestingly scalar. If you look at somewhere like Japan in the Meiji period, there",818240.0,825359.0

67,acknowledgement of the uniqueness and the importance of Ryukyuan languages,872000.0,877119.0

68,"But when I first encountered this word, I pronounced it /foʊ/ because I didn't know",313520.0,316879.0
68,anything about the pronunciation of Vietnamese. L: I remember when I learnt that the Vietnamese,316880.0,322399.0
68,vowel that's used for 'pho' is slightly different and definitely not what you would read if you were,322400.0,327759.0
68,reading that directly as an English word. I love getting to update my knowledge of,327760.0,333999.0
68,how to pronounce words. I got to learn something about Vietnamese that I didn't know at that time.,334000.0,339039.0
68,G: I expect neither of us are still pronouncing that word exactly how it's said in Vietnamese,339040.0,343519.0
68,because we're still just doing an English approximation of it.,343520.0,345759.0
68,"L: Vietnamese is a language with tones, and I definitely don't know what tone",345760.0,351119.0
68,that would be. It's a mid-point in pronunciation that's closer to the original Vietnamese word.,351120.0,357359.0
68,Part of that is that there is some of the orthography in Vietnamese that's not,357360.0,361199.0
68,normally carried over into English. Part of the glitchy-ness of copy-pasting a word over from one,361200.0,368079.0
68,language to another is that sometimes it needs to be copied into a new orthography as well as a new,368080.0,373359.0
68,writing system. That can change things up as well. G: Right. There're some things that are easier to,373360.0,378239.0
68,copy over. If not pronouncing a T is free -- everyone knows how to not pronounce a T --,378240.0,383599.0
68,"but producing that French R or the nasal vowel in 'croissant,' like producing the tone in",383600.0,389519.0
68,"Vietnamese, is something that is not present in English. Depending on what other languages you've",389520.0,394319.0
68,"been exposed to, certain types of pronunciation things can come with it or not come with it.",394320.0,398399.0
68,"L: Of course, there're always complications and exceptions.",398400.0,402079.0
68,Japanese has a writing system that deals specifically with words of foreign origin -- the,402080.0,408239.0
68,katakana syllabary. There are some words that have been borrowed for so long that they have their own,408240.0,414239.0
68,kanji. They're more fully included in the writing system that Japanese has for its own vocabulary. A,414240.0,420879.0
68,"word like 'tobacco,' which was brought into Japan along with the leafy product in the 16th century,",420880.0,428159.0
68,"has its own kanji, which means that it is much less immediately recognisable as a loanword",428160.0,434559.0
68,"than something that is much more modern. G: Ah, 'tobacco,' that sounds like",434560.0,438479.0
68,"it already fits the sounds of Japanese and the syllable structure of Japanese,",438480.0,441999.0
68,so it wouldn't seem as obviously foreign as a word that was pronounced very differently. I,442000.0,446319.0
68,think one of the classic examples with how writing systems sometimes influence how words get borrowed,446320.0,452799.0
68,is -- so in Chinese there's a whole bunch of Chinese characters that have both a sound,452800.0,456879.0
68,part and a meaning part to their shape. There's a small set of about 200 that are used to convey,456880.0,463999.0
68,spellings of words that are borrowed in from other languages. But their meaning is still transparent,464000.0,470079.0
68,if you're a Chinese speaker. You still recognise what that meaning is. You just also realise from,470080.0,474639.0
68,context that it's being used to represent a foreign word. When Coca-Cola was first becoming,474640.0,481119.0
68,"available in Chinese, Coca-Cola the company hadn't yet made an official transliteration available",481120.0,487279.0
68,"to shopkeepers. So, various shopkeepers came up with their own ad hoc transliterations using these",487280.0,494159.0
68,200 characters that are used for foreign words. L: I'm a little bit alarmed by 'various' and 'ad,494160.0,499519.0
68,hoc' in that sentence there. G: As well you should be,499520.0,504159.0
68,because some of these versions that people came up with -- so the word 'la' -- I'm sure,504160.0,510079.0
68,I'm doing the tone wrong -- corresponds to the character for 'wax.' A lot of them have to do,510080.0,515919.0
68,with wax to make sounds like 'ko-ka-ko-la' such as 'female horse fastened with wax.',515920.0,522959.0
68,L: Delicious. G: 'Wax-flattened mare' or 'Bite the wax tadpole.',522960.0,528959.0
68,L: Right. I can see why you probably don't wanna leave the transcription of your loanword in the,528960.0,535599.0
68,"hands of an ad hoc committee of shopkeepers. G: So, Coca-Cola the company did end up coming",535600.0,541519.0
68,up with their own transliteration actually using 'ko-ka-ko-le' because they couldn't,541520.0,545439.0
68,find a good 'la' word that had a meaning that they wanted to associate with their product.,545440.0,549839.0
68,L: What did that come out as. G: That came out 'ko-ku-ko-le' meaning,549840.0,554879.0
68,"'to allow the mouth to be able to rejoice.' L: Oh, definitely more satisfying from a",554880.0,560239.0
68,"marketing perspective than 'wax-flattened mare.' G: Yeah, exactly. There's ways that you deal with",560240.0,565919.0
68,pronunciation and approximating pronunciation and also giving people the ability to write,565920.0,570239.0
68,or transfer formats from one thing to another. L: I guess we can think of finger spelling in,570240.0,575999.0
68,"signed languages as a kind of loanword technique. Well, the signed languages I'm familiar with,",576000.0,584239.0
68,"including Auslan and ASL, there is a sign that represents each of the 26 letters of the",584240.0,590799.0
68,"English alphabet. If you need to tell someone, say, a person's name, and they don't have a sign",590800.0,597439.0
68,"for their name in the language, you can spell out their name, or you can spell out a technical term,",597440.0,602559.0
68,if you just need to refer quickly to that. The rate at which people finger spell is phenomenal,602560.0,607919.0
68,whether it's the one-handed ASL system or the two-handed BSL/Auslan system. But sometimes the,607920.0,614159.0
68,finger spelling becomes the name of the word. There're a few examples -- I know,614160.0,618399.0
68,"the Auslan for 'ham' is literally just the letters H-A-M, so kind of a loanword there.",618400.0,624879.0
68,"G: I sometimes see this when I'm looking at interpreters at conferences, and the speaker",624880.0,629439.0
68,"will say some sort of technical term, and then I'll see the interpreter a couple of seconds",629440.0,633279.0
68,"later clearly spelling out something. And then sometimes, they'll be in a bit of dialogue with",633280.0,637039.0
68,"the d/Deaf person sitting in the front row, and then the d/Deaf person will tell them,",637040.0,639999.0
68,"'Oh, you mean this term,' and then they'll start using something that's the actual sign",640000.0,644559.0
68,for the technical term if they don't know what that is in ASL or a different sign language.,644560.0,649119.0
68,"L: Yeah, I think it turns up a lot in interpreting because you're often moving between a word in",649120.0,655039.0
68,"English and either agreeing upon a sign or planning some kind of commonality there,",655040.0,660079.0
68,but it's not a strategy that has to be used in the language.,660080.0,663359.0
68,"Most words have their own sign, so it is kind of cute and funny when a word like 'ham' pops up.",663360.0,669119.0
68,G: It's sort of a way of bridging between these two modalities.,669120.0,673439.0
68,One of my favourite examples of something that happens when a word gets brought over from,673440.0,677839.0
68,one language to another is that sometimes the meaning can shift a bit while that's happening.,677840.0,683919.0
68,L: Another little glitch in the copy-paste. G: Exactly. I encounter this a lot in French,683920.0,690959.0
68,"because I encounter French so much. Recently, I encountered the word /seɑ̃s/ which in",690960.0,697199.0
68,"English would be 'séance.' L: 'Séance' as, like,",697200.0,699839.0
68,"a thing where you try and speak to the dead. G: Yeah. But in French, 'séance' can also just",699840.0,704639.0
68,be used as a less formal version of a session. L: Okay. That means it must pop up in a far,704640.0,710719.0
68,broader range of contexts than speaking to the dead.,710720.0,713199.0
68,"G: Right. You can have something like a 'therapy séance' or a 'workout séance,'",713200.0,717039.0
68,and that just means a session. L: And nothing paranormal?,717040.0,720559.0
68,Just to be really clear. G: No paranormal people at the,720560.0,723919.0
68,"gym or not with your paranormal therapist. L: So, we've borrowed it into English with",723920.0,728479.0
68,"a really narrow meaning, but it has this much broader meaning in French.",728480.0,731919.0
68,"G: Exactly. The same thing goes amazingly with the word 'baguette' which, again,",731920.0,736479.0
68,I imagine most people are probably familiar with as the long bread.,736480.0,739519.0
68,L: Long loaf of bread. G: But 'baguette' is,739520.0,742239.0
68,"actually a French word for a long, thin object. L: Oh, so this explains why long-cut gems and",742240.0,749439.0
68,"diamonds and emeralds are called 'baguette cut.' G: Ah, I guess it does.",749440.0,753839.0
68,"L: I always thought that they were named after the loaf of bread,",753840.0,757679.0

68,"G: And also, this explains why -- a friend of mine who was doing a French exam where you had",763120.0,768479.0
68,"a reading passage, reading comprehension, and they had in this passage 'baguette magique,'",768480.0,774639.0

68,and sometimes embarrassingly different meanings. L: Let's go with a couple of our favourites,830080.0,835999.0

68,"is a school. But even though they have different meanings, they do share a history because a Greek",863920.0,869839.0
68,gymnasium was where you'd learn and work out all together in an integrated system. German took one,869840.0,875679.0
68,"part of that meaning, and English took the other part. You wanna be really sure whether you're",875680.0,879999.0
68,walking into a place of learning or working out. G: I think the equipment that you'd bring with,880000.0,884639.0
68,you would be very different depending on which one you're aiming to do.,884640.0,888239.0
68,The one that always gets me -- and this is a very Canadian experience of learning vocabulary from,888240.0,892559.0
68,"packaging -- is that you can get toothpaste that's labelled 'pour les dents sensible,' which is for",892560.0,898159.0
68,what looks like sensible teeth. L: Your sensible toothpaste.,898160.0,901599.0
68,"G: But in fact, it is for sensitive teeth because 'sensible' and /sɑ̃sibl/ have different",901600.0,906159.0
68,meanings even though they look the same. L: All of these examples are really great,906160.0,909759.0
68,reminders that you can't just eyeball a loanword and take it for granted because,909760.0,914879.0
68,"it's not always quite that simple. G: Sometimes, you get a word that",914880.0,918079.0
68,"looks like a loanword, it looks like it comes from another language, but it doesn't actually exist",918080.0,922399.0
68,"in the other language with that meaning or, sometimes, with any meaning at all.",922400.0,926719.0
68,"There's this great French word 'le babyfoot.' L: As in, like, the foot of an infant?",926720.0,931839.0
68,"G: Yes, but it's all one word, 'babyfoot.' L: Okay. What does it mean? Because",931840.0,937039.0
68,it sounds adorable. G: It refers to the game,937040.0,941359.0
68,that's found in pubs sometimes where you have a football game that you can play on a table,941360.0,947119.0
68,"where you twiddle the little knobs, which in English is known as 'foosball,' but that's",947120.0,952399.0
68,"actually borrowed from German 'Fußball,' which refers to just football in general.",952400.0,956639.0
68,"L: Ah, we just call it 'German football.' Wow. That is definitely a borrowing that had a shift.",956640.0,962879.0
68,"G: It's this double shift where the French one is supposed to be English, but the English one",962880.0,967039.0
68,"is trying to be German, and the German word for this game is 'Kicker,' which also looks like it's",967040.0,973199.0
68,trying to be English. L: Amazing.,973200.0,975119.0
68,"G: So, everyone's like, yeah, it's a great game. It has something to do with",975120.0,978239.0
68,"foot, but it's not a word in our language. L: Because the linguist in me always is picking",978240.0,985359.0
68,"up on what people are saying, I found it really interesting that especially when you put the",985360.0,990479.0
68,"'le' in front of it, your pronunciation of 'babyfoot' changed a little bit from how you",990480.0,995599.0
68,say it in English. You had kind of moved it into a slightly more French pronunciation.,995600.0,1001119.0
68,G: I think it's something that I think about a lot when it comes to borrowing,1001120.0,1006319.0
68,a word or using a loanword -- how much are you using the target language's pronunciation? If,1006320.0,1011999.0
68,"I'm borrowing something into English, do I pronounce it in an English way?",1012000.0,1015119.0
68,Or how much are you using the source language's pronunciation?,1015120.0,1019279.0
68,And how this varies depending on your level of knowledge of both of those languages and,1019280.0,1025279.0
68,also who you're talking to and how much of those languages they know and even what you're trying to,1025280.0,1030639.0
68,"prove. Is this something you've experienced? L: Yeah, I think about this a lot when I'm",1030640.0,1036239.0
68,moving between Australia and Nepal and when I choose to use particular words and how I,1036240.0,1041919.0
68,"pronounce them. A word like 'chia,' which is the Nepali word for 'tea' and, particularly,",1041920.0,1047599.0
68,"the very sweet, strong tea that is brewed in Nepal, when I'm speaking to a Nepali in Nepal",1047600.0,1054239.0
68,"in the language, I will say 'chia,' but if I'm speaking to Australians there, I might say,",1054240.0,1061039.0
68,'Do you want chai?' because that's the word they're more familiar with for that drink.,1061040.0,1065199.0
68,"G: And if you go back to Australia, and you're in a coffee shop, and you're like,",1065200.0,1068799.0
68,"'Oh, can I get a chai latte,' or something. L: I would never try and order 'chia' unless",1068800.0,1072559.0
68,I'm with people who are gonna make it properly. G: There's this much parodied tendency for North,1072560.0,1079519.0
68,Americans to go on a trip to Barcelona and come back saying /barθelona/ or something like that,1079520.0,1084319.0
68,"and have learnt zero other words of Spanish or Catalan at the time, but",1084320.0,1088319.0
68,"now they're correcting everyone's pronunciation of the city,",1088320.0,1090399.0
68,"and you're like, 'I don't know.' L: We have an exemplary sketch of",1090400.0,1093919.0
68,"this that we'll link to in the shownotes where one of the characters in the sketch continuously, from",1093920.0,1099999.0
68,"all of the languages that they are borrowing words from, will use a very over-the-top pronunciation.",1100000.0,1106479.0
68,G: It's interesting because there are absolutely contexts in which pronouncing a word,1106480.0,1111519.0
68,"the way people are saying it around you is the polite thing to do, and there're also",1111520.0,1115759.0
68,"contexts in which pronouncing a word the way it's pronounced in the origin language, especially when",1115760.0,1119439.0
68,"it's been something that's borrowed in English for a long time, is over-the-top and seems like",1119440.0,1124159.0
68,you're over-exoticising a word or pretentiously talking down to somebody else because they,1124160.0,1129599.0
68,"are saying 'bruschetta' or something like that. It's this interesting balance, and I",1129600.0,1133199.0
68,don't think there's just one answer. L: I think there are certainly factors,1133200.0,1136719.0
68,that you can take into account when you're making a decision about how to pronounce a word and that,1136720.0,1141279.0
68,"we all do take into account subconsciously -- what language are you speaking in,",1141280.0,1146639.0
68,"and who are you speaking to, and where are you, are all great things to keep in mind when you're",1146640.0,1151279.0
68,"making a choice about the pronunciation of a word like 'croissant.' And for me,",1151280.0,1155119.0
68,"even thought I'm not a very good French speaker, I will try and say it more",1155120.0,1159119.0
68,francophone if I'm in a French-speaking country. G: I think being sensitive to some of the power,1159120.0,1163919.0
68,dynamics around that and there isn't just one answer for all of these circumstances.,1163920.0,1168879.0
68,"Sometimes, these power dynamics, like how you pick which pronunciation to use in which circumstances,",1168880.0,1173519.0
68,also show up in terms of which words get borrowed in the first place.,1173520.0,1177119.0
68,I think the classic example in English is how we have a word for 'cow' which refers to the animal,1177120.0,1183599.0
68,and 'beef' which refers to the meat of that animal. The same thing with 'pig' and 'pork' or,1183600.0,1188639.0
68,"'sheep' and 'mutton,' although not as many people talk about mutton these days, or maybe 'chicken'",1188640.0,1193199.0
68,and 'poultry.' We have certain types of doublets of this in English. 'Cow' and 'pig' and 'sheep',1193200.0,1199439.0
68,all come from Old English where 'beef' and 'pork' and 'mutton' come from Norman French because of,1199440.0,1205359.0
68,this idea that the English-speaking peasants were out in the fields farming with the cows and the,1205360.0,1211119.0
68,"pigs, and the Norman overlords were sitting there with their nicely sliced meat that was already",1211120.0,1217199.0
68,"prepared for them. So, the French word came to be used for the prepared or the dead thing,",1217200.0,1223199.0
68,whereas in French you can have a 'mouton' or 'bœuf' or something that refers to both the animal,1223200.0,1228239.0
68,"and the meat, the same way we do for chicken. L: We also see this play out in terms of which",1228240.0,1232719.0
68,languages we borrow scientific or technical vocabulary from. A lot of the vocabulary,1232720.0,1238799.0
68,"that we have in English for these fields comes from Latin, and it comes from Greek. In fact,",1238800.0,1244479.0
68,"when we were preparing this show, Gretchen, you told me that 'tungsten' is actually a Swedish",1244480.0,1249679.0
68,"word. And I got completely surprised because I just assumed that it, like many of the other",1249680.0,1254959.0
68,"words for elements, had a Latin or a Greek origin. G: Yeah, I came across this tweet saying that",1254960.0,1260159.0
68,"'tungsten' is literally from 'heavy stone' in Swedish, which you can kind of see that",1260160.0,1263919.0
68,"'-sten' meaning 'stone' part, but the element is actually called 'wolfram,'",1263920.0,1267839.0
68,"or probably /volfram/, in Swedish. L: Oh, so we didn't even borrow",1267840.0,1271759.0
68,their name for the element from them; we borrowed the word 'heavy stone.',1271760.0,1275519.0
68,G: It just shifted again. This is something that I came across a lot when I was learning,1275520.0,1279839.0
68,about constellations because a lot of constellation names that we use,1279840.0,1284319.0
68,for groups of stars still come from Greek mythology even though many cultures have had,1284320.0,1288479.0
68,names for groups of stars in their ontologies. But the ones in the scientific community has inherited,1288480.0,1292399.0
68,have been largely from Greek. The names of specific stars largely come from Arabic.,1292400.0,1298799.0
68,I feel like this reflects maybe some differences in priorities about are you,1298800.0,1302079.0
68,gonna name the specific stars or are you gonna name the groups of stars that these,1302080.0,1305199.0
68,"two cultures that came in contact with each other. Now, scientists have this hybrid system",1305200.0,1309759.0
68,"where it's some parts Greek, some parts Arabic. L: One of the things I always find interesting",1309760.0,1313839.0
68,about these loanwords that come to us in batches from particular domains is how,1313840.0,1319519.0
68,"it highlights global history, and usually global histories of trade and different power dynamics",1319520.0,1325759.0
68,that have operated over that history. One of my absolute favourite stories is the story of tea.,1325760.0,1332239.0
68,"We've already talked about 'chai' and 'chia' in Nepali, 'tea' in English. The words for 'tea'",1332240.0,1338639.0
68,in many of the world's languages appear to be related. They'll either have some kind of /te/ or,1338640.0,1343839.0
68,"/ti/ pronunciation or some kind of /t͡ʃ/ -- 'chia,' 'chai' pronunciation. That's because there were",1343840.0,1349439.0
68,two main places in China from which tea travelled to all the different markets in the world.,1349440.0,1355519.0
68,"G: In Mandarin, which is historically more spoken towards the centre of China, the word for tea is",1355520.0,1360959.0
68,"'cha,' but in Min Nan, which is also a variety of Chinese as spoken in the coastal province of",1360960.0,1366719.0
68,"Fujian, it's pronounced /te/. They use the same character, but they're pronounced differently,",1366720.0,1371519.0
68,which is very common for how Chinese gets written. The key thing here is 'coastal' because,1371520.0,1375999.0
68,"people who encountered the plant and the drink tea via the sea, via Fujianese traders,",1376000.0,1383439.0
68,"learned to pronounce it /te/ or variants on /te/. In French and German, it's /te/. In English,",1383440.0,1388239.0
68,it used to be /te/ until the vowel shifted. Whereas people who encountered,1388240.0,1391999.0
68,"tea through Central China, through land routes like the silk road -- so through",1392000.0,1397039.0
68,"Sinitic 'cha' -- you get Mandarin 'cha,' Korean 'cha,' Japanese 'ocha,' but also Hindi 'chai,'",1397040.0,1404639.0
68,"Persian 'chai,' Arabic 'shai,' Turkish 'chai,' Russian 'chai,' and you're down to Swahili 'chai,'",1404640.0,1412319.0
68,"all goes through that land route, and sometimes via Persia, to get from 'cha' to 'chai.'",1412320.0,1417919.0
68,The great maps that people have produced where you can tell if people encountered tea through,1417920.0,1422799.0
68,"the land route where they get 'cha,' which becomes 'chai,' or through the sea route, which",1422800.0,1427679.0
68,becomes 'te' and variants on 'te' like 'tea.' L: Then there are a small number of languages like,1427680.0,1433199.0
68,"Polish where the word for tea is 'herbata,' which is a borrowing from the Latinate word",1433200.0,1438879.0
68,that we have in our language as 'herb.' G: In places where tea leaves were already,1438880.0,1444159.0
68,"indigenous, and they weren't encountering them via trade, like in Burmese, for example,",1444160.0,1448399.0
68,tea leaves are 'lakphak' -- I hope I'm saying that right -- because they didn't need to,1448400.0,1452719.0
68,use a trade word for something they already had. L: One of the other global stories I love,1452720.0,1457039.0
68,is the transfusion of the technology and the terminology for books out from Arabic into,1457040.0,1465199.0
68,"a large sphere of the world. G: 'Kitab' is the Arabic word for book, but words",1465200.0,1471599.0
68,"that are related to 'kitab' show up in a whole bunch of languages around the world -- Persian,",1471600.0,1476559.0
68,"Hindi, I think Nepali, right? L: Mm-hmm.",1476560.0,1478953.0
68,"G: Azerbaijani, Kazakh. So, in that area of Asia. But also, Swahili. In Kinyarwanda, the word",1478954.0,1486639.0
68,"is 'igitabo,' which sounds like 'kitab,' but you've put more vowels in it. Then the plural is",1486640.0,1493359.0
68,"'ibitabo' because the 'gi-' becomes B, basically, to make it plural, which is a systematic thing",1493360.0,1499999.0
68,"that happens in a whole bunch of words. They were like, 'Ah, a singular that begins with 'ki-',",1500000.0,1503519.0
68,"we know what to do with this,' and sort of adapted that to the local way of forming words as well.",1503520.0,1508879.0
68,It's this great example of how you borrow when you need to fill a gap in your vocabulary. A,1508880.0,1513679.0
68,lot of languages have borrowed the English word for 'computer' because 'computer' spread through,1513680.0,1517199.0
68,"English. And then whenever I see 'kitab' show up in another language that I'm encountering, I'm",1517200.0,1521199.0

68,"when a word gets borrowed, often it will be regularised into the language. 'Kitab,'",1525360.0,1532559.0
68,"the plural in Arabic is 'kutub,' but in Kinyarwanda, it's regularised into the",1532560.0,1538639.0
68,"plural system there. In languages like Nepali, it's 'kitab' in the singular and 'kitabharu'",1538640.0,1544879.0
68,"in the plural. They've used their standard plural form there as well. So, part of the borrowing it",1544880.0,1550639.0
68,in and making it part of your own vocabulary is making it part of the grammatical system.,1550640.0,1556479.0
68,"G: Sometimes, this happens through reanalysing part of the word to do something else. Sometimes,",1556480.0,1561279.0
68,you could just add another thing like '-haru' to make it plural. I almost feel like English,1561280.0,1565199.0
68,"is missing out because we didn't get to be part of the 'kitab' party. But if we borrowed it,",1565200.0,1568639.0
68,we'd probably turn it into 'kitabs' because that's how we make plurals.,1568640.0,1571919.0
68,"When English borrowed the word for 'cherry' from French, we borrowed it as /t͡ʃeriz/, which is",1571920.0,1577599.0

68,"L: Okay! Huh, there we go. As an English speaker, my brain just hears that /s/",1594560.0,1599839.0

68,a language's borrowing can happen with the stuff that's already going on in the language,1605760.0,1609439.0
68,"I think the more fun it is. One of my favourite examples of this is the word for 'download,'",1609440.0,1614799.0

68,German verb would in that context. G: Right. But it's separating out the,1634640.0,1638399.0
68,"'down' and the 'load' because German is close enough to English that they're like, 'Oh, yeah,",1638400.0,1642239.0
68,"we can recognise that these are two parts, and we're gonna put the 'ge-' in the middle,'",1642240.0,1645359.0
68,which you wouldn't do if it was something that you were borrowing and you didn't have any,1645360.0,1649199.0
68,context for. It's an interesting reanalysis. L: English has borrowed so many words from,1649200.0,1655679.0
68,"languages like Latin and Greek, usually via French, that we now have just borrowed the affixes",1655680.0,1662559.0
68,"that they use. So, '-ation' in English, like 'motivation' and 'meditation,' they were Latin",1662560.0,1668479.0
68,words with their Latin affixes. But now I can use a suffix like '-ation' or '-ise' is another one,1668480.0,1673759.0
68,"from Greek. I could say, 'I can chai-ise my cake.' G: Putting chai in it, yeah.",1673760.0,1679999.0
68,"L: Not the most elegant example of that, but it's now become something useful in English because",1680000.0,1685519.0
68,"we borrowed so many words with these affixes. G: The other thing that I find really fun when,",1685520.0,1690959.0
68,"again, watching languages intertwine via borrowing is when the concept behind the word gets borrowed",1690960.0,1697039.0
68,but not the actual word itself. They translate it sort of piece by piece.,1697040.0,1700479.0
68,I first encountered this when I was learning German in high school. I learned the German,1700480.0,1705199.0
68,"word 'Fernseher,' which means 'television,' but it literally translates as 'far seer.'",1705200.0,1711599.0
68,'Fernseher' is 'far seer.' L: Hang on. Wait a minute.,1711600.0,1715039.0
68,That's also what 'television' means. G: It sure is. 'Tele-' is Greek for,1715040.0,1722799.0
68,"'distance' and 'vision,' of course, is seeing. So, somebody went and said, 'Oh,",1722800.0,1727119.0

68,What if we use Germanic roots for this concept?' L: And you get the 'far seer.' Another really,1730240.0,1735759.0
68,great example of this is English 'skyscraper' because those two parts 'sky' and 'scraper' get,1735760.0,1741919.0
68,"literally translated across a range of languages. G: Yeah. Because in French it's 'grateciel,'",1741920.0,1746959.0
68,"which is literally, like, 'scrapes sky.' L: Italian is 'grattacielo' and German",1746960.0,1752319.0
68,"is 'Wolkenkratzer.' They all literally mean, 'scraped sky.'",1752320.0,1756479.0

68,of contact that English has had with an incredible variety of other languages.,1786240.0,1790719.0
68,"G: Exactly. 'Uncleftish' -- like, an atom is literally something that's 'not split' in its",1790720.0,1796479.0
68,"Greek roots. So, if you have 'un-cleft,' that is literally translating piece-by-piece this idea",1796480.0,1802799.0

68,"because 'hydro-' just means 'water.' L: Amazing, but I imagine",1810800.0,1814479.0
68,quite a bit of mental gymnastics to read. G: It's definitely an interesting thought,1814480.0,1821359.0
68,"experiment to read, but it hasn't caught on. L: The technical term for this translation,",1821360.0,1828239.0
68,"instead of just borrowing the word but translating it literally into the other language, is called",1828240.0,1833999.0
68,"'calquing,' which I find very satisfying because 'calque' is a loanword from French,",1834000.0,1839759.0
68,but 'loanword' is a calque of the German word that we got the concept from in the first place.,1839760.0,1846239.0
68,G: It's like 'calque' is a loanword but 'loanword' is a calque. You could've really just done,1846240.0,1851599.0
68,"this the other way around, and it would've been pleasantly symmetrical. But also, no.",1851600.0,1855679.0
68,"L: It would've been wonderfully self-defining, but here we are.",1855680.0,1859279.0
68,G: I also find it really interesting when languages borrow other grammatical features,1859280.0,1865279.0
68,from each other. They may be a little bit more abstract than an individual word. There's a really,1865280.0,1870719.0

68,"I spent a couple of weeks being like, now I need to pay attention to all of the sources",1913760.0,1918239.0
68,for all the information that I had while I was speaking English even though we don't have,1918240.0,1921839.0
68,this as a grammatical type of thing. Marianne Mithun's paper points out that if you have a,1921840.0,1927519.0
68,"whole region where a whole bunch of languages have evidentiality, even though historically",1927520.0,1931679.0
68,"evidentiality only comes from one family that's not necessarily related to all of them,",1931680.0,1936319.0
68,it might be because a lot of people have been bilingual and multilingual in this area for a long,1936320.0,1941279.0

68,make you wanna use those optional ways of marking evidence in the other languages you speak as well.,1947200.0,1953839.0
68,L: This definitely fits with what I've noticed in Yolmo. There is an evidential,1953840.0,1959759.0
68,"category for something being a generally known fact. I get a lot of examples like,",1959760.0,1964879.0
68,"'Lemons are sour,' 'Sugar is sweet,' and this doesn't exist in any of the other",1964880.0,1969999.0

68,"There is a long history of women coming from those villages and marrying into the Yolmo area,",1976640.0,1983039.0
68,and so our working theory is that they brought this evidential that they found useful in their,1983040.0,1989039.0
68,"own language, in Tamang, and brought it into Yolmo. They have a calque, so it's",1989040.0,1993919.0

68,"L: For sure. It's all very gradient and, as we've discussed a little bit so far,",2053520.0,2059039.0
68,very context-dependent. But to give a sense of how borrowings can be old enough that we even forget,2059040.0,2065359.0

68,"in 'Mississippi' the same root? G: Yeah. Those are both 'great,",2157840.0,2161839.0

68,G: Yes. We have not only 'Great River River' but also 'Lake Large Lake' because there's a,2168480.0,2173839.0

68,"and Malay word, 'timur,' meaning 'east,' and then there's several different versions of",2227920.0,2231759.0
68,more 'east' from European languages as well. L: I think about this a lot when I'm back,2231760.0,2236079.0

68,pointing out that 'naan bread' is a duplication of the same concept because 'naan' just means,2255280.0,2261679.0

68,of 'bread bread.' L: It goes in both,2281520.0,2283279.0
68,"directions as well. We duplicate 'naan bread,' and they duplicate 'pa roti.'",2283280.0,2288319.0

68,"taking a particular linguistic stance. If you're adding the word that you're familiar with to it,",2294800.0,2299999.0

72,to which you would have to answer yes at,143459.0,145318.0
72,this point right but my question is why,145319.0,148439.0
72,the awkward repetition like why does,148440.0,150958.0
72,English make us specify whether the,150959.0,153119.0
72,thing happened now or in the past like,153120.0,156238.0
72,why can't they just say are you were you,156239.0,159779.0
72,a guest on enthusiasm,159780.0,162059.0
72,I mean there are definitely some,162060.0,163799.0
72,languages that do things like this so in,163800.0,165958.0
72,Chinese for example you don't have to,165959.0,167399.0
72,specify the time in a statement like you,167400.0,169318.0
72,can say the time but you don't have to,169319.0,170999.0
72,say it which is like one of the,171000.0,172919.0
72,parameters on which language varies but,172920.0,175559.0
72,the specific legal question also has,175560.0,178079.0
72,stuff going on in it it's partly because,178080.0,180979.0
72,legalese is a technical variety of,180980.0,184199.0
72,English but it doesn't waste just use,184200.0,186539.0
72,technical vocabulary that makes it seem,186540.0,189119.0
72,opaque it also uses everyday words in a,189120.0,191579.0
72,way that have really Technical and,191580.0,193079.0
72,specific meanings and some of that is,193080.0,195419.0
72,because legalese is about this process,195420.0,198598.0
72,of building laws on top of each other,198599.0,200458.0
72,and historically layering them so a word,200459.0,203999.0
72,that has a really common meaning in,204000.0,206458.0
72,general develops this really specific,206459.0,207899.0
72,meaning in the legal context I also,207900.0,210359.0
72,think it's because lawyers have this,210360.0,213299.0
72,very sort of pedantic approach to,213300.0,214738.0
72,language and like looking at every,214739.0,216299.0
72,single like comma and potential for,216300.0,218279.0
72,ambiguity because in realistic language,218280.0,220679.0
72,like we tolerate a lot of them security,220680.0,222359.0
72,and we sort of figure it out from,222360.0,223619.0
72,Context but the whole thing with laws,223620.0,225598.0
72,and trying to get it exactly on your,225599.0,226798.0
72,side is not really allowing space for,226799.0,228839.0
72,context and trying to pin everything,228840.0,230158.0
72,down really precisely,230159.0,232259.0
72,well I was thinking about it if I wanted,232260.0,234719.0
72,to create that ambiguity like if I,234720.0,237298.0
72,wanted to ask,237299.0,238859.0
72,are you in Nova Scotia now or have you,238860.0,241318.0
72,been there in the past like how would I,241319.0,244499.0
72,do that and I I couldn't figure it out I,244500.0,247859.0
72,think in ordinary English you might just,247860.0,250438.0
72,ask one version of the quiz like have,250439.0,252598.0
72,you ever been to Nova Scotia have you,252599.0,255539.0
72,ever been an enthusiasm and then someone,255540.0,258119.0
72,would just answer that with uh yes in,258120.0,260638.0
72,fact I'm there right now,260639.0,263339.0
72,we're trying to be helpful to each other,263340.0,265439.0
72,in conversation in a way that law,265440.0,268079.0
72,doesn't necessarily start from the same,268080.0,270359.0
72,premise of being helpful at starting,270360.0,271978.0
72,from the premise of being complete and,271979.0,273659.0
72,starting from the premise of being,273660.0,274679.0
72,actually kind of antagonistic,274680.0,276198.0
72,deliberately unhelpful yeah it's sort of,276199.0,278758.0
72,like an adversarial approach to language,278759.0,280198.0
72,rather than the Cooperative approach we,280199.0,281519.0
72,normally have yeah that makes sense,281520.0,283198.0
72,making it clear from Context that you,283199.0,285299.0
72,are asking about both the past and the,285300.0,287039.0
72,present even if you're only specifically,287040.0,288418.0
72,referring to one of them yeah because,288419.0,290579.0
72,like if I say like have you ever been,290580.0,293159.0
72,interested in linguistics yes I still am,293160.0,296099.0
72,like is still sort of true but in this,296100.0,298918.0
72,legal sense you might be like no it's,298919.0,300359.0
72,not that I was before it's that I am now,300360.0,302219.0
72,like it's just sort of like trying to,302220.0,303839.0
72,catch people out and being incredibly,303840.0,305939.0
72,pedantic if you wanted to add a way in,305940.0,309359.0
72,English to make that explicitly,309360.0,310799.0
72,ambiguous like if you wanna if I wanted,310800.0,312779.0
72,a way to say use something something,312780.0,315499.0
72,enthusiasm guest is there a natural,315500.0,318418.0
72,structure that you would add if you were,318419.0,320339.0
72,in charge of revising English well I,320340.0,323038.0
72,mean one option you could do so like,323039.0,325258.0
72,English technically has only two tenses,325259.0,327899.0
72,passed and non-past because you can say,327900.0,330059.0
72,something like tomorrow I go to the,330060.0,331559.0
72,airport and like I fly to this place and,331560.0,333719.0
72,so you can use what's often called the,333720.0,335939.0
72,present to refer to future events so if,335940.0,338779.0
72,non-past is sort of the more versatile,338780.0,341519.0
72,English tense you could just sort of,341520.0,342779.0
72,make a special rule that's like you,342780.0,344099.0
72,don't change it I think probably the,344100.0,346439.0
72,most realistic English way would be to,346440.0,348299.0
72,try to add an auxiliary,348300.0,350038.0
72,so like the future in English is often,350039.0,352258.0
72,formed with will or gonna so you could,352259.0,354299.0
72,have a new one of those like are you,354300.0,357359.0
72,sort of enthusiasm guest or like you,357360.0,360659.0
72,ever a enthusiasm guest yeah yeah you,360660.0,363719.0
72,could use maybe use ever into like,363720.0,366119.0
72,dropping the verb would help entirely or,366120.0,369659.0
72,yeah like making some sort of some new,369660.0,371879.0
72,version of like wood or sorta or,371880.0,373739.0
72,something just a new tenseless version,373740.0,375478.0
72,of English yeah just delete all the,375479.0,377579.0
72,chances in general I feel like that,377580.0,379138.0
72,would keep the lawyers even busier,379139.0,381859.0
72,so I'm curious about the sounds of,381860.0,384779.0
72,English I know there are some sounds,384780.0,386219.0
72,that are merging together like the,386220.0,387839.0
72,distinction between caught and caught in,387840.0,390779.0
72,some dialects are there any sounds or,390780.0,393719.0
72,phonemes that are currently like in the,393720.0,396359.0
72,process of coming into English or,396360.0,398339.0
72,disappearing from it entirely there's,398340.0,400859.0
72,one that is disappearing and becoming a,400860.0,403439.0
72,ghost before our very ears which has,403440.0,407159.0
72,Millennia of History which is what is,407160.0,410219.0
72,known as the wine wine merger the wine,410220.0,413579.0
72,wine merger so that wh what that is,413580.0,417418.0
72,pronounced by some older speakers or,417419.0,419579.0
72,speakers of very fancy registers like RP,419580.0,421978.0
72,is so which having a bit of a Hawaiian,421979.0,425159.0
72,over my wine as you can hear from both,425160.0,427198.0
72,we had learned we both have the merger,427199.0,428818.0
72,we have absolutely merged these they are,428819.0,431159.0
72,indistinct for us which and which is a,431160.0,434339.0
72,very forced distinction I have to make,434340.0,436379.0
72,but for maybe like grandparent great,436380.0,441719.0
72,grandparent Generations at the moment,441720.0,443879.0
72,you do find it for some speakers which,443880.0,447119.0
72,is a form of a sound that goes all the,447120.0,450959.0
72,way back to proto-indo-european,450960.0,452939.0
72,oh wow it made it all this time and now,452940.0,455098.0
72,we are the ones killing it off we're,455099.0,457559.0
72,killing it off right now wow so it's,457560.0,460439.0
72,kind of neat because in proto-european,460440.0,463198.0
72,there was a qua sound because a KW which,463199.0,466198.0
72,in modern romance languages has become,466199.0,468239.0
72,qu but still pronounced so this is like,468240.0,471779.0
72,in like cuando or qua or some of these,471780.0,475079.0
72,words you might know from French or,475080.0,476698.0
72,Spanish or Italian and all these words,476699.0,479399.0
72,that have K in it became H in the,479400.0,481619.0
72,Germanic set of words so you get things,481620.0,484499.0
72,like cornu as in Cornucopia became horn,484500.0,488098.0
72,oh yeah as in Horn of Plenty so there's,488099.0,491579.0
72,all these words that have have a k sound,491580.0,493379.0
72,which is sometimes written with a c,493380.0,494519.0
72,sometimes with a Q and those all became,494520.0,496379.0
72,H so this is why we have all these words,496380.0,499079.0
72,that begin with wh who what where when,499080.0,501179.0
72,why and the exceptional how those are,501180.0,503758.0
72,the same as the qua words in those other,503759.0,505859.0
72,languages because that K became an h and,505860.0,509698.0
72,then the H and the W swapped positions,509699.0,511679.0
72,at some point because people people,511680.0,513179.0
72,decided they liked it better and then,513180.0,514978.0
72,like not quite the H stop getting,514979.0,516478.0
72,pronounced but the age influenced the,516479.0,517859.0
72,pronunciation of the W becoming rather,517860.0,520619.0
72,than,520620.0,521398.0
72,I don't even know how you do it now it's,521399.0,524098.0
72,just sort of merged back with that W,524099.0,525599.0
72,that we have and it's so widespread that,525600.0,529619.0
72,the wh set of question words in English,529620.0,532139.0
72,are all K words even in languages like,532140.0,535559.0
72,Hindi and Nepali which are over in the,535560.0,537359.0
72,indo-aryan side of that language family,537360.0,540059.0
72,so you get,540060.0,541579.0
72,kinako Kaira oh so it's really old yeah,541580.0,546419.0
72,but so that's why that H is there even,546420.0,547979.0
72,though most people don't pronounce it I,547980.0,549599.0
72,think you're more likely to get sounds,549600.0,551338.0
72,enter like one variety of English or,551339.0,554458.0
72,disappear from one variety of English,554459.0,555838.0
72,and then sort of that change spreads for,555839.0,558719.0
72,a long time and it takes a while to like,558720.0,559919.0
72,get there get to all of them so you,559920.0,562379.0
72,still occasionally find wine and wine as,562380.0,565379.0
72,distinct or more often you find it,565380.0,566939.0
72,distinct in Scotland a lot of Ireland,566940.0,570119.0
72,and apparently older speakers in New,570120.0,572458.0
72,Zealand have been slower than,572459.0,574379.0
72,Australians and Canadians and Brits in,574380.0,576898.0
72,dropping this yeah that makes sense I,576899.0,578939.0
72,know a few people who have that,578940.0,580859.0
72,distinction too but like you said it,580860.0,582719.0
72,does tend to be older people although I,582720.0,584759.0
72,always find it funny I I always answer,584760.0,587039.0
72,those dialect quizzes saying that I,587040.0,589199.0
72,pronounced c-o-t and c-a-u-g-h-t the,589200.0,592379.0
72,same and then someone I was describing,592380.0,595499.0
72,this merger to someone and they said no,595500.0,597719.0
72,you don't say in the sentence and I said,597720.0,600958.0
72,it out loud and I realized I had I'm,600959.0,603179.0
72,inside me I didn't hear how it sounded,603180.0,605219.0
72,from the outside okay say the words like,605220.0,607679.0
72,I caught him sleeping on the cot I,607680.0,609599.0
72,caught him sleeping on the cot oh you,609600.0,611278.0
72,absolutely say this differently they are,611279.0,613379.0
72,very different yeah I would say I caught,613380.0,615659.0
72,him sleeping on the cot yeah I I was,615660.0,617759.0
72,born in that pocket of Pennsylvania,617760.0,619018.0
72,where when I looked on those dialect,619019.0,620699.0
72,maps that area is one of the unmerged,620700.0,623219.0
72,areas,623220.0,624599.0
72,yeah and like all these sorts of splits,624600.0,626458.0
72,like you know dropped for whom were,626459.0,628018.0
72,added for whom like Indian English has a,628019.0,630539.0
72,bunch of retroflex sounds like other T's,630540.0,632999.0
72,and D's are produced with the tongues,633000.0,634919.0
72,that have curled back onto the tip of,634920.0,636599.0
72,the mouth so you know that's entered one,636600.0,639539.0
72,variety of English but you know it seems,639540.0,641759.0
72,probably unlikely it'll spread to all of,641760.0,643018.0
72,the other varieties but who knows one,643019.0,644639.0
72,can hope because I would love to be able,644640.0,646799.0
72,to distinguish between a retroflex and a,646800.0,648599.0
72,non-retroflex,648600.0,649919.0
72,too late for plasticity of my phonemic,649920.0,653039.0
72,inventory but for future englishes it,653040.0,655199.0
72,could be exciting they're cool sounds,655200.0,656939.0
72,can you practice the sound just enough,656940.0,659939.0
72,that you can convincingly convey it to,659940.0,662099.0
72,other people who then learn it from you,662100.0,663898.0
72,as if it's like it becomes natural for,663899.0,666239.0
72,them deliberately raise a family of,666240.0,669599.0
72,people who have these distinctions I,669600.0,671819.0
72,mean I've always thought it'd be cool to,671820.0,673259.0
72,come up with some sort of I don't know,673260.0,674578.0
72,like conlang or something you could,674579.0,676078.0
72,teach a kid or some sort of array of,676079.0,677338.0
72,like here's like three languages you,677339.0,679499.0
72,could teach a kid that would give them,679500.0,681778.0
72,the maximal number of phonemic,681779.0,683939.0
72,distinctions based on those languages,683940.0,685619.0
72,because like Germanic languages actually,685620.0,687838.0
72,have tons of vowels cross linguistically,687839.0,690059.0
72,like a lot of languages have like five,690060.0,691559.0
72,vowels or three vowels or maybe seven,691560.0,693179.0
72,and English has like 14 ish depending on,693180.0,695879.0
72,the dialect I'd like German like I think,695880.0,698398.0
72,Norwegian Dutch also all Germanic,698399.0,700859.0
72,languages have tons of vowels so if,700860.0,702359.0
72,you're like okay you want to include one,702360.0,703499.0
72,Germanic language for the vowels and,703500.0,705239.0
72,then you want like a language that has,705240.0,707278.0
72,tons of consonants like maybe ubic,707279.0,709139.0
72,something around and the caucuses for,709140.0,711179.0
72,sure yeah something around the caucuses,711180.0,712739.0
72,for consonants and then maybe a language,712740.0,714359.0
72,with like lots of tones like Cantonese,714360.0,716159.0
72,has more tones than mandarins so like,716160.0,717479.0
72,maybe give them Cantonese so they get,717480.0,718799.0
72,tone and then you have like this nice,718800.0,720838.0
72,sort of array of you know this will make,720839.0,723419.0
72,it easier for you to learn any other,723420.0,724439.0
72,language because you've got like most of,724440.0,725999.0
72,the major sound distinctions life's very,726000.0,728518.0
72,good because you also have a really good,728519.0,729659.0
72,spread of a language that's isolating,729660.0,731518.0
72,and doesn't have a lot of morphology,731519.0,732719.0
72,three to one with middling English is,732720.0,734879.0
72,very underwhelmingly average and then,734880.0,737099.0
72,those Caucasian languages do tend to,737100.0,739439.0
72,have really good morphology so be,739440.0,741778.0
72,typologically satisfying on multiple,741779.0,743398.0
72,fronts yeah so raise your kid to be,743399.0,746039.0
72,Cantonese yubik English trilingual and,746040.0,748439.0
72,they'll be all set for their future,748440.0,749458.0
72,language learning I think we've said,749459.0,752338.0
72,everything unuseful to say about that,752339.0,755099.0
72,question,755100.0,757199.0
72,so say we're playing a game I'm gonna,757200.0,759539.0
72,pick a random North American English,759540.0,761879.0
72,speaker and ask them a spoken or written,761880.0,764398.0
72,usage question like how would you say,764399.0,766319.0
72,this how do you pronounce this how do,766320.0,767879.0
72,you write this now you get to pick,767880.0,770099.0
72,someone else to ask the same question to,770100.0,772199.0
72,without knowing what it's going to be,772200.0,773458.0
72,and if your person gives the same answer,773459.0,775679.0
72,as my person then you win now who would,775680.0,779219.0
72,you pick if you wanted the best chance,779220.0,781799.0
72,of matching a random person would you,781800.0,785398.0
72,pick like a a news anchor a kid or like,785399.0,788939.0
72,a nondescript middle-aged person or like,788940.0,792239.0
72,a writer or something I think I have an,792240.0,794458.0
72,answer Gretchen who would you pick so I,794459.0,797099.0
72,think this is really complicated because,797100.0,798659.0
72,I want to know like what's the spoken or,798660.0,800578.0
72,written usage question that you're,800579.0,802259.0
72,asking them because I think it would,802260.0,804059.0
72,depend what are the parameters that this,804060.0,805919.0
72,varies on because if it's an age-based,805920.0,807539.0
72,usage question that I'm asking then I,807540.0,810059.0
72,want to pick based on age but if maybe,810060.0,811739.0
72,it's like geography that's more relevant,811740.0,813659.0
72,or like Urban status I think you'd,813660.0,816239.0
72,probably want somebody instead of like a,816240.0,817859.0
72,mid-sized City because language change,817860.0,820138.0
72,tends to happen faster in urban centers,820139.0,821759.0
72,and slower and rural areas you want to,821760.0,823259.0
72,sort of split the difference but not one,823260.0,825119.0
72,of the mid-sized cities that has like,825120.0,826859.0
72,distinctive stuff going on like,826860.0,828239.0
72,Pittsburgh has got a whole bunch of,828240.0,829499.0
72,stuff that's been documented for it so,829500.0,831059.0
72,yeah I'm like what are you going to do,831060.0,832739.0
72,for a gender I guess you sort of want,832740.0,834419.0
72,somebody who's around the middle for a,834420.0,835979.0
72,lot of Statistics you know sort of,835980.0,838138.0
72,middling in age not too old not too,838139.0,840299.0
72,young middling in types ofCity I don't,840300.0,843059.0
72,know what do you learn do you have a,843060.0,844319.0
72,more specific answer oh yeah I'd pick,844320.0,846119.0
72,Alexa cover Phil,846120.0,849259.0
72,and you tell them what the game is what,849260.0,852838.0
72,well all of the people who have,852839.0,855599.0
72,tounderstand language uses I always,855600.0,857699.0
72,find lexicographers have a really solid,857700.0,860458.0
72,appreciation for what is in the mind of,860459.0,863578.0
72,the average language user and so they'd,863579.0,866518.0
72,be the first group of people that come,866519.0,867958.0
72,to mind for me so I guess we want,867959.0,869039.0
72,someone who's at the intersection of,869040.0,870119.0
72,being a lexicographer and all of those,870120.0,871739.0
72,demographic details that Gretchen was,871740.0,873539.0
72,suggesting I mean I think that's,873540.0,875099.0
72,probably Corey Stamper right because,875100.0,876599.0
72,she's sort of there we go one of the,876600.0,878819.0
72,youngest lexicographers but young for,878820.0,880559.0
72,lexicographer is like I don't know,880560.0,882479.0
72,probably 40s and I think she lives in a,882480.0,884518.0
72,mid-sized American city okay our answer,884519.0,886559.0
72,is Corey Stamper done there we go nice,886560.0,890039.0
72,you know Gretchen I realized as you're,890040.0,892499.0
72,answering that there was a project in,892500.0,894559.0
72,midwestern newspaper ran a contest to,894560.0,897659.0
72,try to find the most average person in,897660.0,899398.0
72,the country huh and they did exactly the,899399.0,902039.0
72,procedure you're describing where they,902040.0,903599.0
72,picked a city that was like the most,903600.0,905398.0
72,mid-sized that was like in the middle on,905399.0,908039.0
72,a whole bunch of variables and then they,908040.0,909299.0
72,had the town like vote on who the most,909300.0,911398.0
72,representative average person in the,911399.0,913259.0
72,town was and they picked this one guy,913260.0,915419.0
72,and he owned a hat store think and then,915420.0,918838.0
72,they were like we found America's,918839.0,920578.0
72,average man and then they took him,920579.0,922138.0
72,around to show him a bunch of stuff and,922139.0,923458.0
72,get his get the average man's opinion on,923459.0,925439.0
72,this and that sort of Proto Joe the,925440.0,927599.0
72,plumber experience,927600.0,929338.0
72,it must be really good to track down the,929339.0,931018.0
72,most average person because they must be,931019.0,933419.0
72,a wealth of marketing insights well I,933420.0,936599.0
72,was also trying to answer the question,936600.0,937799.0
72,for gender because like you can sort of,937800.0,939239.0
72,pick an average age you can pick an,939240.0,940559.0
72,average location but for gender I I do,940560.0,943198.0
72,actually think that there might be,943199.0,944219.0
72,benefits in choosing a non-binary person,944220.0,945778.0
72,not necessarily because non-binary is,945779.0,948599.0
72,like the average of men and women but,948600.0,949859.0
72,there was a really interesting study by,949860.0,951419.0
72,Chantal Gratton on how non-binding,951420.0,953698.0
72,people talk in different types of,953699.0,954898.0
72,circumstances and how they can like,954899.0,958259.0
72,adopt features that are associated with,958260.0,960179.0
72,multiple genders from that sort of axis,960180.0,962819.0
72,so I think again if we're looking for,962820.0,964198.0
72,versatility which is sort of reason for,964199.0,965939.0
72,picking a lexicographer if you're a,965940.0,967679.0
72,non-binary person working in,967680.0,968879.0
72,lexicography we want to hear from you,968880.0,970499.0
72,we've got a great game to play,970500.0,974278.0
72,so if I say it's 3 P.M and hot out what,974279.0,978898.0
72,is it in that sentence because the more,978899.0,982018.0
72,I think about it the more it hurts my,982019.0,983338.0
72,head so that's a fun question because,983339.0,986059.0
72,this it is doing something that's as you,986060.0,989338.0
72,may have noticed sort of semantically,989339.0,991138.0
72,meaningless like that's not the same,991139.0,992698.0
72,thing as I ate it which where it refers,992699.0,996059.0
72,to you know maybe some cake maybe an,996060.0,998159.0
72,apple a physical object that you can,998160.0,999599.0
72,point to the it in it's 3 P.M it's hot,999600.0,1002958.0
72,it's raining is just there because,1002959.0,1006379.0
72,English really hates it when sentences,1006380.0,1008719.0
72,don't have a subject like a real,1008720.0,1010819.0
72,physical subject that's there that,1010820.0,1012859.0
72,you've said even if it doesn't mean,1012860.0,1015138.0
72,anything English is not okay with that,1015139.0,1017659.0
72,there's lots of languages that will,1017660.0,1020239.0
72,happily say something that would,1020240.0,1021739.0
72,translate into English literally as is 3,1021740.0,1024739.0
72,P.M is hot or is 3 P.M and hot and,1024740.0,1028219.0
72,therefore there's no it there and,1028220.0,1031279.0
72,because it's not there for its meaning,1031280.0,1032719.0
72,it's just there to fill this spot in a,1032720.0,1034698.0
72,sentence it doesn't matter that it is,1034699.0,1037159.0
72,filling the role for being 3pm and hot,1037160.0,1039499.0
72,it is just there to tick a box and in,1039500.0,1042499.0
72,fact this is so odd in English and such,1042500.0,1045078.0
72,a quirk of English that it has a name,1045079.0,1047298.0
72,which is dummy yet,1047299.0,1049279.0
72,so wait you could attach that it both to,1049280.0,1052159.0
72,the 3pm and end to another verb so I,1052160.0,1055279.0
72,could say it's 3 P.M and was eaten I,1055280.0,1058459.0
72,don't think you can would you think,1058460.0,1061159.0
72,that's grammatical what just got eaten,1061160.0,1064519.0
72,it's 3 P.M and Eaton is like a Lewis,1064520.0,1067639.0
72,Carroll story or something,1067640.0,1070038.0
72,the it being eaten is suddenly,1070039.0,1071418.0
72,meaningful and so it can't coordinate as,1071419.0,1074239.0
72,an empty dummy yet and a meaningful,1074240.0,1076999.0
72,subject in it yeah I think that's,1077000.0,1078739.0
72,actually a nice test because you can say,1078740.0,1079999.0
72,it's 3 P.M and hot and raining and all,1080000.0,1082399.0
72,of those are doing the same it but when,1082400.0,1084619.0
72,you start combining them I mean I guess,1084620.0,1087019.0
72,if you say like it's hot and eaten now,1087020.0,1088639.0
72,you're just referring to a specific item,1088640.0,1090079.0
72,and not the General State of Affairs,1090080.0,1092239.0
72,some people think the it it's hot or,1092240.0,1094759.0
72,it's raining or first like the weather,1094760.0,1096319.0
72,or the sky but we don't generally go,1096320.0,1099499.0
72,around saying like the sky is raining,1099500.0,1101359.0
72,well now I'm gonna start I mean you can,1101360.0,1105499.0
72,change things it's raining is an,1105500.0,1108079.0
72,interesting construction across,1108080.0,1109159.0
72,languages because a lot of languages,1109160.0,1110418.0
72,require you to say something like rain,1110419.0,1112819.0
72,is raining or water's raining they don't,1112820.0,1115819.0
72,have that dummy construction they've,1115820.0,1117859.0
72,solved it in a different way I should,1117860.0,1119719.0
72,say this is the dummy as in like a like,1119720.0,1121999.0
72,a dressmaker's dummy or like a mannequin,1122000.0,1124279.0
72,in a store window so it's just sort of,1124280.0,1125899.0
72,propping up the clothes and you can,1125900.0,1127999.0
72,think of this it as like propping up the,1128000.0,1129918.0
72,rest of the sentence I also like to,1129919.0,1131659.0
72,think of it as because English is so,1131660.0,1133519.0
72,stressed about not having a subject like,1133520.0,1135499.0
72,a distressed baby it needs a pacifier,1135500.0,1137779.0
72,and that's why you give it a dummy then,1137780.0,1140418.0
72,I think it's 3 P.M and Eaton is gonna,1140419.0,1143719.0
72,stress out English just a little too,1143720.0,1145519.0
72,much,1145520.0,1146418.0
72,yeah so if you want another piece of,1146419.0,1148519.0
72,technical vocabulary this construction,1148520.0,1150199.0
72,like it's 3 P.M and Eaton is known as,1150200.0,1154159.0
72,zugma so this is something like she put,1154160.0,1156918.0
72,out the light and the cat,1156919.0,1159798.0
72,oh I like that you like it but the,1159799.0,1162558.0
72,lawyers would be having a meltdown,1162559.0,1165678.0
72,let's see if there are any other fun,1165679.0,1167298.0
72,examples you held your breath and the,1167299.0,1169879.0
72,door for me I took the podium in my,1169880.0,1172519.0
72,second trophy of the evening the boy,1172520.0,1174859.0
72,swallowed milk and kisses so you can,1174860.0,1177079.0
72,sort of use it for multiple functions,1177080.0,1178519.0
72,but I think normally when zugma kind of,1178520.0,1181219.0
72,works it's I mean you can do it in the,1181220.0,1183439.0
72,sort of abstract like put out the light,1183440.0,1184819.0
72,on the cat because one's a figurative,1184820.0,1186499.0
72,use and one's like a physical use but I,1186500.0,1188538.0
72,think yeah it's 3 P.M in Eden I have,1188539.0,1191418.0
72,trouble,1191419.0,1192558.0
72,it's definitely deliberately playful I I,1192559.0,1194839.0
72,don't even know if it's ungrammatical,1194840.0,1195918.0
72,it's deliberately playful what's,1195919.0,1197779.0
72,afternoon tea it's 3 P.M and eaten yeah,1197780.0,1201558.0
72,it seems like there's an emitted at like,1201559.0,1203359.0
72,it's at 3 P.M and ready because ready is,1203360.0,1206659.0
72,definitely more of an adjective whereas,1206660.0,1208879.0
72,ayton is a more nominalized but still,1208880.0,1211159.0
72,the verb yeah I think it's at 3 P.M that,1211160.0,1214519.0
72,can refer to like the event is at 3 P.M,1214520.0,1216439.0
72,so that's changing it into a literal it,1216440.0,1219079.0
72,again yeah well and the reason I,1219080.0,1221058.0
72,couldn't say it's 3 P.M and I'm eating,1221059.0,1223339.0
72,it is then you're like it's a different,1223340.0,1224839.0
72,it yeah each of them has its own subject,1224840.0,1227418.0
72,so that's fine yeah and it's like oh you,1227419.0,1229399.0
72,didn't say what he's eating but he's,1229400.0,1230479.0
72,eating it you know yeah,1230480.0,1232579.0
72,so as I understand it you can use the,1232580.0,1234859.0
72,International Phonetic Alphabet to,1234860.0,1236899.0
72,transcribe all the sounds that people,1236900.0,1239479.0
72,use in language,1239480.0,1241659.0
72,how do you write a cough in IPA like I,1241660.0,1246019.0
72,was looking through the chart and I,1246020.0,1247159.0
72,couldn't figure out is there a symbol,1247160.0,1248479.0
72,that would go with that sound,1248480.0,1250339.0
72,a general full-throated cough is not,1250340.0,1253459.0
72,something that is specifically a speech,1253460.0,1255678.0
72,sound in any human language so there's,1255679.0,1258499.0
72,not a that we know of yet that we know,1258500.0,1261499.0
72,of yet or that someone has not created,1261500.0,1264798.0
72,to raise their child to attempt to turn,1264799.0,1267319.0
72,into normal phonology so we don't have a,1267320.0,1269899.0
72,specific symbol for a cough in the,1269900.0,1272659.0
72,standard International Phonetic Alphabet,1272660.0,1274579.0
72,as set forward by the International,1274580.0,1276319.0
72,Phonetic Association however,1276320.0,1279619.0
72,you have now unlocked congratulations,1279620.0,1282139.0
72,the extended IPA,1282140.0,1285259.0
72,I've never heard of the extended IPA I,1285260.0,1287959.0
72,don't think we've ever talked about it,1287960.0,1288979.0
72,on an episode so oh how excellent this,1288980.0,1292339.0
72,is yet more IPA for your fun and,1292340.0,1295158.0
72,enjoyment also for useful technical,1295159.0,1298579.0
72,reasons so useful technical reasons are,1298580.0,1301939.0
72,you allowed to tell everyone about this,1301940.0,1303499.0
72,or is this like suppose is this a secret,1303500.0,1305658.0
72,held among linguists,1305659.0,1308479.0
72,classic IPA is devised for linguists to,1308480.0,1312019.0
72,talk about sounds that are in the,1312020.0,1314058.0
72,regular speech repertoire of spoken,1314059.0,1315979.0
72,languages the extended IPA is generally,1315980.0,1319519.0
72,used by speech pathologists to,1319520.0,1321379.0
72,transcribe other sounds that people,1321380.0,1323178.0
72,sometimes make when they're learning to,1323179.0,1325339.0
72,or producing speech differently from how,1325340.0,1328099.0
72,the typical user of their language does,1328100.0,1329779.0
72,it Speech Pathology covers a really wide,1329780.0,1332959.0
72,range it can be anything from working,1332960.0,1334699.0
72,with children who have lisps and,1334700.0,1336739.0
72,stutters through to helping people post,1336740.0,1339319.0
72,stroke or with Aphasia regain the,1339320.0,1342619.0
72,ability to speak so some sounds the one,1342620.0,1345019.0
72,that's really memorable for me is that,1345020.0,1346339.0
72,they have gnashing of teeth in x-ipa and,1346340.0,1350058.0
72,also smacking lips and other types of,1350059.0,1352519.0
72,like whistled version of acetype I'm not,1352520.0,1354499.0
72,going to demonstrate because a I don't,1354500.0,1356058.0
72,think I can and it might be kind of,1356059.0,1357499.0
72,painful if you're on headphones so,1357500.0,1359418.0
72,there's also some sounds in xipa that,1359419.0,1361759.0
72,are I think very difficult to pronounce,1361760.0,1363499.0
72,unless you have a cleft palate because,1363500.0,1365599.0
72,they're bringing the air through through,1365600.0,1367699.0
72,the palette in your mouth where most,1367700.0,1368839.0
72,people don't have a hole there or,1368840.0,1370579.0
72,through your nose and mouth at the same,1370580.0,1371839.0
72,time if you have a cleft palate so,1371840.0,1373459.0
72,that's where I would look if I was,1373460.0,1375739.0
72,looking for coughing because it seems,1375740.0,1377959.0
72,like the kind of thing they might have,1377960.0,1379279.0
72,done okay do they have a whole new set,1379280.0,1381439.0
72,of symbols or is it mostly the Latin,1381440.0,1383839.0
72,letters turned upside down and stuff,1383840.0,1385479.0
72,there's a lot of Latin letters turned,1385480.0,1388459.0
72,upside down or back to front or,1388460.0,1390439.0
72,sometimes they'll use something from the,1390440.0,1393259.0
72,IPA with some additional diacritics and,1393260.0,1395479.0
72,decoration yeah it's a lot of diacritics,1395480.0,1397819.0
72,like things above and below the original,1397820.0,1399859.0
72,letters unfortunately it's very,1399860.0,1402519.0
72,unglamorous having hyped up the xipa,1402520.0,1405558.0
72,there's a whole section for unidentical,1405559.0,1407479.0
72,or indeterminate sounds which are a,1407480.0,1409519.0
72,bunch of symbols in a circle so if,1409520.0,1411259.0
72,you're not sure what consonant was said,1411260.0,1412819.0
72,you can just write C in a circle which,1412820.0,1414558.0
72,is kind of neat but cough is written as,1414559.0,1417139.0
72,do you want to you know get a pencil and,1417140.0,1419058.0
72,write this down okay Open Bracket Open,1419059.0,1422239.0
72,Bracket cough close,1422240.0,1425678.0
72,all right I guess we've already got it,1425679.0,1427879.0
72,way to write that I wish there was some,1427880.0,1430339.0
72,sort of more interesting symbol but,1430340.0,1431959.0
72,there is kind of this whole thing they,1431960.0,1433158.0
72,use like music notation for loud speech,1433159.0,1436038.0
72,and soft speech they have like Forte and,1436039.0,1438259.0
72,pianissimo and these sorts of things,1438260.0,1439839.0
72,this is outside of the xipa but if you,1439840.0,1443119.0
72,want a linguist approved convention for,1443120.0,1445759.0
72,writing laughter in a conversation,1445760.0,1448219.0
72,analysis they use the at sign well,1448220.0,1451579.0
72,that's true and I do have a handful of,1451580.0,1454519.0
72,friends who will text me with at at,1454520.0,1456439.0
72,instead of whoa amazing so it's handy,1456440.0,1460879.0
72,so that reminds me of a Comics problem,1460880.0,1463099.0
72,which is as far as I know there's no,1463100.0,1466879.0
72,good written onomatopoeia or sound,1466880.0,1469819.0
72,effect for the sound of Applause so like,1469820.0,1472579.0
72,if you want to show Applause off screen,1472580.0,1474379.0
72,you know off panel in a comic if there,1474380.0,1477319.0
72,was an explosion you would write boom,1477320.0,1479178.0
72,you know or bang or something yeah it,1479179.0,1481579.0
72,sounds for like splashes like but,1481580.0,1484038.0
72,there's there's nothing for the sound of,1484039.0,1487339.0
72,applauding and I don't even know how to,1487340.0,1488839.0
72,suggest it usually what cartoonists do,1488840.0,1491359.0
72,is cheat and they'll write,1491360.0,1493538.0
72,you know to imply people cheering as,1493539.0,1497119.0
72,someone who studies language and gesture,1497120.0,1499279.0
72,I don't think that's cheating I think,1499280.0,1500779.0
72,that's co-opting the multi-modality of,1500780.0,1503418.0
72,human expression to Advantage in a,1503419.0,1506779.0
72,graphic novel format the other thing,1506780.0,1508999.0
72,you'll sometimes see is people will just,1509000.0,1510499.0
72,write clap clap clap clap so it's not,1510500.0,1513019.0
72,cheating it's you know it's one of the,1513020.0,1514759.0
72,many ways you can use language but I,1514760.0,1517279.0
72,feel like it would be so helpful if,1517280.0,1518779.0
72,there was some way to write that sound,1518780.0,1520879.0
72,and since you're both linguists can you,1520880.0,1523879.0
72,make one,1523880.0,1530298.0
72,they're representing a,1530299.0,1532879.0
72,a,1532880.0,1533678.0
72,conventionalized spoken form is,1533679.0,1536359.0
72,onomatopoeia and some languages do this,1536360.0,1540499.0
72,kind of thing far more frequently and,1540500.0,1542959.0
72,more conventionally than English does so,1542960.0,1546019.0
72,we might want to take a look at a,1546020.0,1548479.0
72,language that does that I think Japanese,1548480.0,1549798.0
72,is one of those languages that has a lot,1549799.0,1551778.0
72,of idiophones and onomatopoeia Japanese,1551779.0,1554178.0
72,does this a ton so the Japanese,1554179.0,1556719.0
72,idiophone onomatopoeia for clapping is,1556720.0,1559459.0
72,Pachi pachy,1559460.0,1561019.0
72,cheap patchy that seems about right yeah,1561020.0,1563359.0
72,it seems about right but the fun thing,1563360.0,1565339.0
72,is also that Pachi can also refer to,1565340.0,1568699.0
72,eight the number eight in Japanese which,1568700.0,1571459.0
72,is more commonly Hachi but it can also,1571460.0,1573859.0
72,be patchy so if you're texting or you're,1573860.0,1576619.0
72,on social media and you want to indicate,1576620.0,1577999.0
72,Applause or clapping you can also write,1578000.0,1579798.0
72,a bunch of eights nice at at least,1579799.0,1582439.0
72,Japanese speakers will know what you,1582440.0,1584418.0
72,mean by that I mean I guess there's also,1584419.0,1586519.0
72,the Emoji these days like people do that,1586520.0,1588918.0
72,as well the Emoji does have those little,1588919.0,1591199.0
72,action lines but to get those action,1591200.0,1593298.0
72,lines into English you know we just made,1593299.0,1595639.0
72,a big deal about Japanese having this,1595640.0,1598219.0
72,onomatopoic form but I think clap is,1598220.0,1601219.0
72,also a form of onomatopoeia we just,1601220.0,1603918.0
72,don't look at it that way huh clap oh no,1603919.0,1607699.0
72,wait so the etymology of clap,1607700.0,1610278.0
72,I've never been on tenter hooks waiting,1610279.0,1612139.0
72,for an atom online definition,1612140.0,1615339.0
72,yeah so the edamame line entry for clap,1615340.0,1618859.0
72,has a common dramatic echoic verb which,1618860.0,1621739.0
72,is also found in Old Friesian old high,1621740.0,1624199.0
72,German old Saxon clapunga and it yeah,1624200.0,1627678.0
72,Unknown Origin probably,1627679.0,1629619.0
72,so I think the obvious thing to do is to,1629620.0,1632479.0
72,put clap clap clap footnote down the,1632480.0,1634819.0
72,bottom of the comic because good Comics,1634820.0,1636859.0
72,should have footnotes you just link to,1636860.0,1638418.0
72,the Adam online entry everyone's happy,1638419.0,1642519.0
72,yes oh man the answer was inside you all,1642520.0,1646459.0
72,along it's like you just start saying,1646460.0,1648619.0
72,clap so fast that you stumble over the,1648620.0,1651079.0
72,sounds and there you've got it from a,1651080.0,1653418.0
72,physical articulatory perspective you're,1653419.0,1655339.0
72,sort of doing a teeny tiny clap with,1655340.0,1657139.0
72,your tongue inside your mouth against,1657140.0,1658879.0
72,the rest of your mouth yeah I mean,1658880.0,1660979.0
72,because well the K is the Clapping with,1660980.0,1663979.0
72,the back and then the put is the front,1663980.0,1666499.0
72,and the LA is the yeah lateral your,1666500.0,1670519.0
72,whole mouth is clapping,1670520.0,1672558.0
72,for different parts of your tongue,1672559.0,1673939.0
72,you're all doing little Taps that goes,1673940.0,1675379.0
72,through your mouth so your whole mouth,1675380.0,1676819.0
72,is applauding that is so cool okay thank,1676820.0,1679819.0
72,you for that,1679820.0,1683058.0
72,so this might be more of a almost a,1683059.0,1685939.0
72,question for a singer but you mentioned,1685940.0,1687558.0
72,these sounds that are sort of outside,1687559.0,1688759.0
72,the speech register what's up with the,1688760.0,1691519.0
72,sort of piercing sound of a horror movie,1691520.0,1693798.0
72,Scream is that falsetto is that a normal,1693799.0,1696918.0
72,speech sound but louder is that your,1696919.0,1698839.0
72,throat doing something weird,1698840.0,1700879.0
72,great paper about screaming which is,1700880.0,1703099.0
72,brilliantly titled human screens occupy,1703100.0,1706158.0
72,a privileged niche in the communication,1706159.0,1708079.0
72,soundscape which I think begins to,1708080.0,1710778.0
72,answer your question it suggests that,1710779.0,1712519.0
72,screams are Universal and acoustically,1712520.0,1714859.0
72,unique so that they'll alert us to,1714860.0,1717019.0
72,danger and ensure and I quote biological,1717020.0,1720079.0
72,and ultimately social efficiency I guess,1720080.0,1722418.0
72,the Hope being that like if someone's,1722419.0,1724099.0
72,screaming even if you don't speak their,1724100.0,1726739.0
72,language you can still tell like this is,1726740.0,1728239.0
72,a human distress signal we normally,1728240.0,1730399.0
72,write a screen from an onomatopoeia,1730400.0,1732619.0
72,perspective as ah with a lot of A's and,1732620.0,1735319.0
72,maybe H's because ah is like the most,1735320.0,1738259.0
72,open of the vowels like the jaw is just,1738260.0,1740538.0
72,fully dropped okay like it's it's the,1740539.0,1743298.0
72,least restricted if you tried to screen,1743299.0,1744619.0
72,something like,1744620.0,1746019.0
72,you'd have to like have your mouth be a,1746020.0,1748219.0
72,lot more closed yeah you'd never write,1748220.0,1750038.0
72,III but I guess that's why the e in,1750039.0,1754038.0
72,shriek is like trying to because it's,1754039.0,1756139.0
72,closed but it also then tends to,1756140.0,1758058.0
72,correlate with perceptually higher,1758059.0,1760339.0
72,pitched things so that's trying to give,1760340.0,1762798.0
72,you that perception about being really,1762799.0,1764898.0
72,high pitched which are doesn't,1764899.0,1766459.0
72,necessarily do yeah because some Comics,1766460.0,1768859.0
72,will do a i e e e like I.E trying to get,1768860.0,1773298.0
72,the best of both yeah trying to give her,1773299.0,1775038.0
72,the high-pitchedness of it the other,1775039.0,1777199.0
72,thing about this paper is that it says,1777200.0,1778639.0
72,that screams are acoustically well,1778640.0,1780558.0
72,segregated from other communication,1780559.0,1782359.0
72,signals as in they're higher pitch than,1782360.0,1784999.0
72,other communication signals and that,1785000.0,1786619.0
72,this is also partly to avoid false,1786620.0,1788239.0
72,alarms because like imagine if like a,1788240.0,1790819.0
72,third of your words just had like the,1790820.0,1792379.0
72,screen bit in them and then you'd kind,1792380.0,1794418.0
72,of be like the boy who cries wolf or,1794419.0,1795918.0
72,like oh well if you're screaming all the,1795919.0,1797119.0
72,time nothing's ever urgent yeah you know,1797120.0,1799519.0
72,what there are a few animals that make,1799520.0,1801259.0
72,sounds that I think are in that screen,1801260.0,1803778.0
72,register because people get freaked out,1803779.0,1805278.0
72,by them I think foxes and then elk do a,1805279.0,1808999.0
72,weird noise there's some animals that,1809000.0,1811099.0
72,make sounds like crying babies which I,1811100.0,1813019.0
72,don't know if that's also in the same,1813020.0,1814158.0
72,range but the the scream cluster is in,1814159.0,1817639.0
72,30 to 150 Hertz and so if animals,1817640.0,1820519.0
72,probably some of them are in that range,1820520.0,1822439.0
72,and you could measure that and that,1822440.0,1823999.0
72,there's also a perceptual attribute,1824000.0,1826459.0
72,called roughness that screams tend to,1826460.0,1828678.0
72,have so I I really don't want to,1828679.0,1831259.0
72,demonstrate a scream and really freak,1831260.0,1832639.0
72,people out listening to the podcast uh,1832640.0,1834379.0
72,but if you think about your earliest,1834380.0,1835699.0
72,like you know horror movie Scream style,1835700.0,1837678.0
72,it's got that sort of back and forth,1837679.0,1840139.0
72,modulation that's that's sort of,1840140.0,1841519.0
72,roughness,1841520.0,1843259.0
72,I'm curious it was interesting to,1843260.0,1844999.0
72,realize that I learned from you about,1845000.0,1846439.0
72,how emojis a lot of them represent,1846440.0,1848658.0
72,gestures and how some of them are things,1848659.0,1851178.0
72,we have words for but some of them,1851179.0,1853278.0
72,aren't,1853279.0,1854298.0
72,so what are some gestures that people do,1854299.0,1856519.0
72,without realizing this is a type of,1856520.0,1858859.0
72,communication or like without having a,1858860.0,1861019.0
72,word for it,1861020.0,1862339.0
72,I'm going to tell you the answer but,1862340.0,1864619.0
72,once I do you will never unsee this so I,1864620.0,1868158.0
72,just have to repay you for that fact,1868159.0,1869959.0
72,there is something that everyone who,1869960.0,1873079.0
72,Gestures does all the time and it has a,1873080.0,1877398.0
72,specific technical name and that is the,1877399.0,1880759.0
72,repetition in a gesture to indicate,1880760.0,1883158.0
72,duration or emphasis and this kind of,1883159.0,1886158.0
72,repetition is known as a beat gesture,1886159.0,1888499.0
72,you will absolutely see it in the most,1888500.0,1892519.0
72,clearest manifestation if you watch a,1892520.0,1895398.0
72,politician give a speech because they,1895399.0,1897678.0
72,love to use them to give a sense of,1897679.0,1900199.0
72,coherence to what they're saying it's,1900200.0,1901879.0
72,this magic thing if you if you're giving,1901880.0,1903918.0
72,a speech here's a pro tip you can use,1903919.0,1906319.0
72,beat gestures and if you continue to use,1906320.0,1908658.0
72,the same repetition on your stressed,1908659.0,1911239.0
72,syllables I'm doing it now but you can't,1911240.0,1913278.0
72,see it yeah I learned I feel like you're,1913279.0,1915139.0
72,really emphasizing the B gestures in a,1915140.0,1916879.0
72,very auditory way I'm emphasizing the,1916880.0,1919038.0
72,beat dresses auditorily but if you,1919039.0,1921079.0
72,continue to do this just your repetition,1921080.0,1923239.0
72,you can actually give the sense that,1923240.0,1925819.0
72,everything you're saying alongside those,1925820.0,1927558.0
72,gestures is the same topic or it's,1927559.0,1930379.0
72,coherent even though it may not actually,1930380.0,1932538.0
72,be so huh so this is like when you're,1932539.0,1935298.0
72,shaking your hand up and down as you,1935299.0,1937158.0
72,talk in the up and down motion and goes,1937159.0,1939499.0
72,with with the syllables and then,1939500.0,1940879.0
72,suddenly when you do that I have this,1940880.0,1942619.0
72,urge to vote for you vote for Lauren she,1942620.0,1945739.0
72,can't be beat,1945740.0,1948979.0
72,That's My slogan,1948980.0,1951979.0
72,so you could combine it with a thumbs up,1951980.0,1954019.0
72,if you want to be like that was a really,1954020.0,1955219.0
72,great job or a pointing gesture so it,1955220.0,1957558.0
72,combines with other gestures that's part,1957559.0,1959119.0
72,of why you see it everywhere but,1959120.0,1960558.0
72,sometimes a person's hands won't be,1960559.0,1962778.0
72,indicating like a pointing gesture or,1962779.0,1964999.0
72,they won't be giving any information,1965000.0,1966079.0
72,about you know the size or the shape of,1966080.0,1968239.0
72,something they're just doing this,1968240.0,1969918.0
72,repetition and the analogy in emoji is,1969919.0,1973879.0
72,that we use a lot of repetition in our,1973880.0,1976038.0
72,Emoji to do the same kind of emphasis or,1976039.0,1979579.0
72,duration so a string of clapping hands,1979580.0,1982398.0
72,to show Applause in emoji or a string of,1982399.0,1984798.0
72,Hearts to say I really love that idea is,1984799.0,1988699.0
72,it true that if you make someone hold,1988700.0,1990379.0
72,their hands still when they're talking,1990380.0,1991759.0
72,they're less coherent or have a harder,1991760.0,1994339.0
72,time forming sentences I feel like I,1994340.0,1996678.0
72,heard that somewhere the general,1996679.0,1998298.0
72,suggestion is yes and I think we've,1998299.0,2000879.0
72,talked about it before and I've said,2000880.0,2002199.0
72,that's the case I've been returning to,2002200.0,2004298.0
72,this literature and we'll probably,2004299.0,2005439.0
72,revisit it in an episode but it turns,2005440.0,2007719.0
72,out that there is a lot of variation in,2007720.0,2009999.0
72,what people mean when they say that,2010000.0,2011678.0
72,they've stopped people from gesturing,2011679.0,2013798.0
72,and so there's a lot of variation in,2013799.0,2016658.0
72,just how much it really does change how,2016659.0,2019359.0
72,people speak possibly sometimes it's,2019360.0,2021339.0
72,just because they come up with these,2021340.0,2023018.0
72,really fantastically bizarre experiments,2023019.0,2026259.0
72,like there's somewhere they like tied,2026260.0,2027879.0
72,them down so they can't gesture right,2027880.0,2029499.0
72,and maybe being tied down is a bit,2029500.0,2030999.0
72,distracting yeah oh yeah there are some,2031000.0,2034719.0
72,fascinating study designs,2034720.0,2037119.0
72,yeah I mean anytime you have to have,2037120.0,2038619.0
72,anyone do anything in an MRI their,2038620.0,2041018.0
72,circumstances are not going to be,2041019.0,2042579.0
72,natural to you know but what you really,2042580.0,2044918.0
72,need to do is just raise someone in an,2044919.0,2046959.0
72,in like have all the furniture in their,2046960.0,2049598.0
72,house be shaped like an MRI and then,2049599.0,2051219.0
72,they'd be totally comfortable with it so,2051220.0,2052719.0
72,like they go to sleep and it's in an MRI,2052720.0,2054219.0
72,and they're couch the way they watch TV,2054220.0,2055719.0
72,isn't an MRI adding it to my long list,2055720.0,2057819.0
72,of study design ideas that are terrible,2057820.0,2060759.0
72,and a lot in this area are fascinatingly,2060760.0,2063039.0
72,bad,2063040.0,2064658.0
72,so a lot of the time I'll read fiction,2064659.0,2066819.0
72,or you know watch a movie where there's,2066820.0,2069158.0
72,a fictional language so if I come across,2069159.0,2072519.0
72,a sample of a language and I'm trying to,2072520.0,2075158.0
72,figure out is this a real natural human,2075159.0,2079539.0
72,language or is it something that was,2079540.0,2081459.0
72,created by a language Enthusiast to seem,2081460.0,2084158.0
72,real if you were hired as like,2084159.0,2086259.0
72,detectives to try to figure it out what,2086260.0,2088299.0
72,do you look for what would be the,2088300.0,2089378.0
72,Hallmarks of an invented language,2089379.0,2091838.0
72,this sounds like a great linguist job,2091839.0,2093519.0
72,yeah what would be the Hallmarks the the,2093520.0,2096098.0
72,giveaways you know it's someone who's,2096099.0,2097479.0
72,trying to make it seem like a natural,2097480.0,2098979.0
72,language so if you were trying to figure,2098980.0,2100419.0
72,out if you're looking at a real language,2100420.0,2101919.0
72,or one by someone who's trying to fool,2101920.0,2104139.0
72,you what would you look for I would go,2104140.0,2106299.0
72,straight to trying to find the,2106300.0,2108519.0
72,irregularities and if there are no,2108520.0,2110679.0
72,irregularities that's an immediate sign,2110680.0,2113199.0
72,that you have something that is too neat,2113200.0,2115598.0
72,to have been slowly evolved collectively,2115599.0,2118539.0
72,as a communal agreement by a collection,2118540.0,2120759.0
72,of speakers especially if there are like,2120760.0,2122979.0
72,some people who do this and some people,2122980.0,2124539.0
72,that do that because like one of the,2124540.0,2125919.0
72,things with artificial languages they,2125920.0,2127179.0
72,tend to make like one language but like,2127180.0,2129338.0
72,as we were talking about with like wine,2129339.0,2131259.0
72,and wine or trying to find the averagist,2131260.0,2134139.0
72,English speaker like everyone slightly,2134140.0,2135699.0
72,different with a language so if you,2135700.0,2137019.0
72,don't have any of that representation of,2137020.0,2138699.0
72,different people are doing this slightly,2138700.0,2140139.0
72,differently and we don't fully know,2140140.0,2142179.0
72,exactly how all of this stuff works but,2142180.0,2143799.0
72,like here's a bunch of ways that it,2143800.0,2145059.0
72,could be yeah I think I would go,2145060.0,2147338.0
72,probably straight to the pronoun system,2147339.0,2149979.0
72,or how they do copulas so in English is,2149980.0,2153759.0
72,r b m are all copular verbs but they're,2153760.0,2157719.0
72,all a bit of a hot mess because over,2157720.0,2159699.0
72,time we've created this really,2159700.0,2161879.0
72,unbalanced Paradigm or we've taken two,2161880.0,2164439.0
72,different verbs and turned them into the,2164440.0,2165819.0
72,past and the present of the current one,2165820.0,2167618.0
72,or with pronouns you know we have we,2167619.0,2169899.0
72,just borrowed they from one of the,2169900.0,2171759.0
72,Scandinavian languages and you can't,2171760.0,2173379.0
72,actually find a robust explanation for,2173380.0,2175479.0
72,where she came from in the English,2175480.0,2176979.0
72,Paradigm and yeah we just me and me are,2176980.0,2179559.0
72,incredibly ill balanced and if you have,2179560.0,2182319.0
72,a completely neat like I have all these,2182320.0,2185078.0
72,pronouns and they're perfectly clear,2185079.0,2186459.0
72,which one is me and which one is you and,2186460.0,2188679.0
72,which one single and which one's plural,2188680.0,2190179.0
72,and like oh that is that is suspiciously,2190180.0,2193059.0
72,regular and language is very good at,2193060.0,2195639.0
72,being a regular in these high use areas,2195640.0,2198338.0
72,it's like a house that no one lives in,2198339.0,2199719.0
72,because it's like suspiciously tidy and,2199720.0,2201578.0
72,I think also like the high use areas,2201579.0,2203499.0
72,like in a house that you live in tend to,2203500.0,2205719.0
72,have more regularity going on I think,2205720.0,2208059.0
72,it's sort of the difference between like,2208060.0,2209379.0
72,a stair rail or something that's been,2209380.0,2211239.0
72,Polished by like generations of people,2211240.0,2212858.0
72,walking by it and having their hand on,2212859.0,2214659.0
72,it and like some areas will be smoother,2214660.0,2216159.0
72,than others like it's hard to get that,2216160.0,2218618.0
72,kind of patina of use without lots of,2218619.0,2221739.0
72,people doing it I find the best way to,2221740.0,2224019.0
72,do that when I'm constructing languages,2224020.0,2226118.0
72,for fictional worlds is just to bring a,2226119.0,2229358.0
72,degree of absent-mindedness to my work,2229359.0,2231459.0
72,so I might just generate the pronoun,2231460.0,2235899.0
72,Paradigm twice and then take the bits I,2235900.0,2238598.0
72,like of both of them but then randomly,2238599.0,2240519.0
72,forget sometime and use another form so,2240520.0,2243098.0
72,there's one completely irregular one in,2243099.0,2245199.0
72,there oh that makes sense yeah now and,2245200.0,2247719.0
72,then I see people complain about like oh,2247720.0,2249999.0
72,this show is unrealistic because the,2250000.0,2252219.0
72,characters pronounce this one,2252220.0,2253539.0
72,character's name two different ways you,2253540.0,2255219.0
72,know like in Star Wars some of them say,2255220.0,2256719.0
72,Han Solo and someone say hands solo and,2256720.0,2259059.0
72,that's because they haven't prepared,2259060.0,2260199.0
72,well enough it's just two different,2260200.0,2261639.0
72,parts of the Galaxy yeah as somebody,2261640.0,2264399.0
72,named Lauren gone or as you say it,2264400.0,2266799.0
72,Lauren gone yes people never pronounce,2266800.0,2269799.0
72,real people's names differently,2269800.0,2270999.0
72,depending on their accent people would,2271000.0,2272858.0
72,never have a Gone Gone merger that would,2272859.0,2275858.0
72,be completely unrealistic for my co-host,2275859.0,2277959.0
72,to use the incorrect vowel in,2277960.0,2280059.0
72,pronouncing my name because I don't have,2280060.0,2282338.0
72,your go on vowel,2282339.0,2284979.0
72,so yeah that kind of irregularity I do,2284980.0,2287618.0
72,have to say sometimes there is,2287619.0,2289598.0
72,implausible irregularity so in Game of,2289599.0,2292239.0
72,Thrones I found it comedically,2292240.0,2293679.0
72,implausible that every single member of,2293680.0,2295959.0
72,Arya Stark's family would pronounce her,2295960.0,2297999.0
72,first name differently but I can totally,2298000.0,2300999.0
72,believe there is an entire galaxy where,2301000.0,2302679.0
72,there are two different ways to,2302680.0,2303699.0
72,pronounce Han or Han yeah so it's like,2303700.0,2306519.0
72,the difference between there being oh a,2306520.0,2308319.0
72,couple of different accents you know,2308320.0,2309519.0
72,some people say this name this way some,2309520.0,2311078.0
72,people say Han some people say Han,2311079.0,2312879.0
72,versus like these people have clearly,2312880.0,2314858.0
72,not met Arya because they all say it,2314859.0,2317379.0
72,differently their own family members,2317380.0,2318519.0
72,don't seem to know yeah yeah and like,2318520.0,2320799.0
72,and the reasons you are often motivated,2320800.0,2322719.0
72,in some sort of factor like if you have,2322720.0,2324639.0
72,characters okay people who are in this,2324640.0,2325959.0
72,group do this people who are in that,2325960.0,2326979.0
72,group do this but like why do these,2326980.0,2329679.0
72,characters who all grew up together in,2329680.0,2332078.0
72,the same environment why did they talk,2332079.0,2333939.0
72,so differently if they all grew up,2333940.0,2335139.0
72,together and like maybe there's some,2335140.0,2336819.0
72,sort of other reason right but like what,2336820.0,2339039.0
72,sort of factors are influencing how,2339040.0,2340358.0
72,people are are talking differently or,2340359.0,2341799.0
72,like oh we just happened to hire a bunch,2341800.0,2343059.0
72,of actors from different places whatever,2343060.0,2345098.0
72,and like sometimes you get a show that,2345099.0,2346659.0
72,does that sort of accent neutral casting,2346660.0,2348999.0
72,or accent indifferent casting but if you,2349000.0,2351098.0
72,want to create within World story,2351099.0,2352358.0
72,reasons for people you know oh we're,2352359.0,2354759.0
72,gonna give all the good guys British,2354760.0,2355959.0
72,accents,2355960.0,2358319.0
72,so yeah a bit of Randomness and Whimsy,2358320.0,2360879.0
72,definitely helps bring a language to,2360880.0,2362618.0
72,life yeah that's a really clever thing,2362619.0,2364479.0
72,to look for I it's nice to know that you,2364480.0,2366519.0
72,could just be a little bit less,2366520.0,2368319.0
72,fastidious and and actually make it seem,2368320.0,2370779.0
72,more real,2370780.0,2371919.0
72,so let's just suppose optimistically,2371920.0,2374319.0
72,that this podcast recording survives for,2374320.0,2377139.0
72,50 or 100 years like I always think it's,2377140.0,2379419.0
72,funny we're sitting here recording this,2379420.0,2380799.0
72,at a specific time and place but it's,2380800.0,2383019.0
72,going to be listened to in the future,2383020.0,2384459.0
72,that's true and we don't actually know,2384460.0,2385779.0
72,how far in the future you know people,2385780.0,2387159.0
72,will listen when it's posted but it'll,2387160.0,2388719.0
72,then it'll sit around so I thought it,2388720.0,2390639.0
72,would be fun keeping in mind those,2390640.0,2392439.0
72,people you know 50 or 100 years in the,2392440.0,2394598.0
72,future that if we try to make guesses,2394599.0,2396999.0
72,about features of English that seem,2397000.0,2399399.0
72,unusual to us but will seem like normal,2399400.0,2401919.0
72,usage to the listeners in 2072 or 21 22.,2401920.0,2406598.0
72,so we could make our guesses about what,2406599.0,2408459.0
72,we think usage is going to look like,2408460.0,2410679.0
72,um and then in 100 years the listeners,2410680.0,2412899.0
72,can grade us on who got closest to,2412900.0,2415299.0
72,correct,2415300.0,2416499.0
72,so it's like a contest we wouldn't start,2416500.0,2418358.0
72,scores for a hundred years please if,2418359.0,2420939.0
72,you're listening to this 100 years you,2420940.0,2422559.0
72,know maybe human life expectancy,2422560.0,2424719.0
72,will be around,2424720.0,2426578.0
72,post this episode on The Intergalactic,2426579.0,2429519.0
72,Hollow sphere,2429520.0,2432578.0
72,friends via your brain implant okay,2432579.0,2435578.0
72,get to like subscribe and merge the,2435579.0,2437499.0
72,podcast with your Consciousness at the,2437500.0,2439239.0
72,galactic core,2439240.0,2439969.0
72,[Laughter],2439970.0,2444279.0
72,so I actually have a suggestion that,2444280.0,2446739.0
72,might even work on a shorter time frames,2446740.0,2448539.0
72,we might be around in say 20 years or 30,2448540.0,2451539.0
72,years to hear the answers to some of,2451540.0,2453098.0
72,these okay which would be kind of,2453099.0,2454838.0
72,exciting one of the fastest changing,2454839.0,2457539.0
72,areas of language is that there's a new,2457540.0,2460059.0
72,word for cool about every decade or so,2460060.0,2463118.0
72,sometimes less,2463119.0,2464819.0
72,and I was writing another article where,2464820.0,2467858.0
72,I had to sort of project the future of,2467859.0,2469239.0
72,English and I thought you know if we go,2469240.0,2471279.0
72,back and we look at sort of a list of,2471280.0,2472899.0
72,words for cool do they have any sort of,2472900.0,2475118.0
72,features in common so we could predict,2475119.0,2476799.0
72,what the new cool word for cool might be,2476800.0,2479559.0
72,so some words for cool that may not be,2479560.0,2482319.0
72,cool anymore things like sick hot lit,2482320.0,2486819.0
72,rad sweet tight nice neat and then,2486820.0,2491799.0
72,there's also sort of another subset like,2491800.0,2493299.0
72,Nifty Keen Nifty groovy so apart from,2493300.0,2497618.0
72,Nifty and groovy which both have this,2497619.0,2499779.0
72,sort of e sound at the end all of these,2499780.0,2503199.0
72,other words are are very like consonant,2503200.0,2505959.0
72,vowel consonant from a pronunciation,2505960.0,2508118.0
72,perspective sometimes with like an extra,2508119.0,2510279.0
72,consonant at the beginning or end so,2510280.0,2511659.0
72,something there's like two like sick lit,2511660.0,2514779.0
72,rad sweet nice neat they've all got this,2514780.0,2518259.0
72,sort of bookended consonants on either,2518260.0,2520659.0
72,side,2520660.0,2521679.0
72,so if we come up with some other words,2521680.0,2524199.0
72,that are monosyllables with consonants,2524200.0,2527379.0
72,on either side maybe one of these words,2527380.0,2529899.0
72,will eventually turn into the word for,2529900.0,2531399.0
72,cool so this will be like the first time,2531400.0,2533679.0
72,that I've ever been cool in my life,2533680.0,2536759.0
72,and we can we can come up with some of,2536760.0,2539019.0
72,them I think the current word that the,2539020.0,2540699.0
72,kids are using these days is based which,2540700.0,2544118.0
72,is like the opposite of cringe it's like,2544119.0,2546159.0
72,based in fact sometimes used,2546160.0,2548578.0
72,meta-ironically attributed to the rapper,2548579.0,2551559.0
72,Little B I'm getting this in Urban,2551560.0,2553419.0
72,Dictionary because again like I don't,2553420.0,2555219.0
72,think we're particularly cool here,2555220.0,2557559.0
72,laughs,2557560.0,2559199.0
72,so I've come up with some additional,2559200.0,2561519.0
72,candidates and if you wish to contribute,2561520.0,2562959.0
72,any you also can of like words that have,2562960.0,2565959.0
72,the right phonetic form that could turn,2565960.0,2568419.0
72,into a word for cool maybe but maybe,2568420.0,2571539.0
72,there are more and they don't have to,2571540.0,2573279.0
72,mean something that sounds good right,2573280.0,2574539.0
72,because like sick or something doesn't,2574540.0,2576399.0
72,sound good okay what have you got so sop,2576400.0,2579818.0
72,seems like it's got potential numb I,2579819.0,2582939.0
72,don't know I just feel like numb could,2582940.0,2584799.0
72,mean cool left,2584800.0,2586959.0
72,I don't know maybe it's kind of out from,2586960.0,2589239.0
72,left field or sort of bizarre as a,2589240.0,2590979.0
72,left-handed person I kind of like this,2590980.0,2592118.0
72,one I was gonna say I feel like this is,2592119.0,2593379.0
72,your left-handed affirmation coming,2593380.0,2594879.0
72,through here thank you,2594880.0,2597358.0
72,uh sunk oh yeah I don't know sunk could,2597359.0,2600399.0
72,mean cool look at these these have got,2600400.0,2602618.0
72,some some good Acoustics to them oh,2602619.0,2604899.0
72,getting a new meaning for yeah this like,2604900.0,2606999.0
72,the sunk cost fallacy becomes like the,2607000.0,2609459.0
72,cost positive thing,2609460.0,2612338.0
72,yeah like wow that's so sunk man I can't,2612339.0,2615098.0
72,believe it okay I have a very long bow,2615099.0,2618159.0
72,to draw here and I don't think I'm gonna,2618160.0,2620019.0
72,win with this but I would like to Repose,2620020.0,2623459.0
72,whale as in the ocean-going mammal,2623460.0,2626559.0
72,because,2626560.0,2628059.0
72,okay there are some people who still,2628060.0,2630039.0
72,pronounce that as whale and then I'll,2630040.0,2632139.0
72,have a really obvious token to check if,2632140.0,2634539.0
72,we fully reduce the wine wine merger so,2634540.0,2637659.0
72,that's my wow that's so whale of you,2637660.0,2641979.0
72,I just want to make sure we have a lot,2641980.0,2643358.0
72,of tokens of something that has a wh,2643359.0,2645459.0
72,pronunciation for some people to to make,2645460.0,2647799.0
72,sure that we've definitely closed that,2647800.0,2649779.0
72,merger or it's been demerged,2649780.0,2653799.0
72,um I mean some people are using like the,2653800.0,2655838.0
72,the Beowulf what like ironically now so,2655839.0,2659919.0
72,we can maybe we could get that going,2659920.0,2661419.0
72,bring some of the stuff back or hey this,2661420.0,2664239.0
72,can be my opening if you know America,2664240.0,2666098.0
72,has finished merging caught and caught,2666099.0,2668379.0
72,then we could bring back caught to mean,2668380.0,2670299.0
72,cool oh yeah that's so caught of you no,2670300.0,2674139.0
72,no no you gotta unmerge it that's so,2674140.0,2676479.0
72,quiet of you you know the weird thing is,2676480.0,2678459.0
72,when you're describing this you're using,2678460.0,2679899.0
72,the word cool a lot and it strikes me,2679900.0,2682179.0
72,that like that word has hung on for a,2682180.0,2684999.0
72,weirdly long time and means the same,2685000.0,2688118.0
72,thing and like there are all these other,2688119.0,2689439.0
72,synonyms that come and go but that one,2689440.0,2691419.0
72,like when I read you know old newspapers,2691420.0,2693459.0
72,going back at least you know five or six,2693460.0,2695679.0
72,decades has basically the same,2695680.0,2697179.0
72,connotation,2697180.0,2698199.0
72,yeah and it's interesting that that cool,2698200.0,2700598.0
72,retains its meaning as sort of the meta,2700599.0,2702639.0
72,term for this category whereas like if I,2702640.0,2704618.0
72,say something's groovy now I'm implying,2704619.0,2706479.0
72,it's dated I'm not saying it's still,2706480.0,2708879.0
72,cool yeah I mean like I don't know if,2708880.0,2711219.0
72,there are any more like temperature,2711220.0,2712358.0
72,words I think that in mind has been,2712359.0,2714159.0
72,pretty much exhausted I mean unless,2714160.0,2715959.0
72,you're gonna start saying something's,2715960.0,2716979.0
72,warm yeah like cool chill hot tepid man,2716980.0,2722029.0
72,[Laughter],2722030.0,2724899.0
72,actually look fits and it's now only in,2724900.0,2728739.0
72,the context of lukewarm so yeah but so,2728740.0,2731919.0
72,Luke sorry Luke's out there I mean if,2731920.0,2734259.0
72,you're going for the phonetic profile I,2734260.0,2735939.0
72,think damp fits so that's so damp man oh,2735940.0,2740139.0
72,wait no because that I mean that's very,2740140.0,2741578.0
72,similar to dank that's very similar to,2741579.0,2743259.0
72,dank yeah dank's already there the,2743260.0,2744999.0
72,things people can semantically shift,2745000.0,2746979.0
72,when they set their minds to it are,2746980.0,2748419.0
72,truly astounding but yeah like you,2748420.0,2750639.0
72,really can't predict what's going to be,2750640.0,2752139.0
72,in cool but they do seem to have some,2752140.0,2753699.0
72,sort of phonetic signature so if any of,2753700.0,2755979.0
72,these words that we've mentioned turn,2755980.0,2757659.0
72,into a word for cool I definitely didn't,2757660.0,2759939.0
72,see bass coming so you know who knows,2759940.0,2762459.0
72,that would be very whale,2762460.0,2764379.0
72,we get bragging rights we very well yeah,2764380.0,2767019.0
72,that was that was real tepid of you,2767020.0,2770919.0
72,I put my stake in the ground my,2770920.0,2772479.0
72,prediction when I was a little kid you,2772480.0,2774338.0
72,could tell if someone learned from,2774339.0,2776799.0
72,Reading because they would pronounce,2776800.0,2778779.0
72,certain words ways that like they'd say,2778780.0,2781959.0
72,Deborah's instead of debris because they,2781960.0,2784719.0
72,hadn't heard someone say it they had,2784720.0,2786039.0
72,only read it and I feel like we're,2786040.0,2787899.0
72,conducting so much written communication,2787900.0,2789519.0
72,now I wonder if more of those will just,2789520.0,2791979.0
72,become alternate accepted pronunciations,2791980.0,2794199.0
72,oh good one so like Deborah's facade,2794200.0,2797499.0
72,instead of facade if you were me when a,2797500.0,2800439.0
72,kid sang centrifugal instead of,2800440.0,2802118.0
72,centrifugal yeah exactly Grand Finale,2802119.0,2804879.0
72,there's one that's already sort of there,2804880.0,2807759.0
72,which is forte oh yeah I only just,2807760.0,2811539.0
72,learned that I've been saying that one,2811540.0,2813098.0
72,wrong what would be a non Forte,2813099.0,2815739.0
72,pronunciation of forte,2815740.0,2817838.0
72,Fort I think right because it's,2817839.0,2819519.0
72,originally Italian and in Italian it's,2819520.0,2821618.0
72,both spelled Forte and pronounced Forte,2821619.0,2823598.0
72,but a lot of people write it with an,2823599.0,2825159.0
72,accent mark as if it was French like,2825160.0,2826779.0
72,cafe or resume which gets written with,2826780.0,2828939.0
72,the accent mark and you can understand,2828940.0,2829899.0
72,why you'd want to do this because the E,2829900.0,2832659.0
72,there isn't silent but it's not actually,2832660.0,2835239.0
72,originally a French word yes so yeah I,2835240.0,2837879.0
72,like the reader's pronunciation argument,2837880.0,2839559.0
72,this makes me feel much cooler than,2839560.0,2840999.0
72,coming up with words for cool well,2841000.0,2842858.0
72,mispronunciation is my forte,2842859.0,2846939.0
72,I guess if you're listening to this in a,2846940.0,2849759.0

73,that that is as much a political decision -- often more of a political decision -- than,612720.0,616619.0

73,China where all of these languages that aren't able to be understood by speakers of the other,1645320.0,1650179.0
73,"languages are called 'dialects' to bring them into a larger nation state project. Again,",1650180.0,1655399.0
73,you see that nation state effect on how we're counting languages.,1655400.0,1659059.0
73,G: Something that's interesting about looking at languages through maps is that all these different,1659060.0,1665419.0
73,local dialects are equally old. All of the varieties of Faroese are all descending from Old,1665420.0,1670759.0

73,"there's this weird version of population migration history that comes into your head where you think,",1680420.0,1685099.0
73,"okay, well, people must have spread out from the capital city and then gradually started talking",1685100.0,1688579.0
73,"differently, where really people lived somewhere for various reasons and came to an area for",1688580.0,1695179.0
73,"various reasons and started speaking particular ways for various reasons, and there wasn't really",1695180.0,1699139.0
73,ever one time when everyone spoke the same way in a group of people unless you go through a very,1699140.0,1704719.0
73,"tiny population bottleneck where it was a very small group of people, and they gradually spread",1704720.0,1708859.0

73,"where you draw the lines on your Sprachbund, you begin to see why it's very hard to map something",1719300.0,1724759.0
73,"like language compared to something like, 'Is it a country? What kind of climate does it have?'",1724760.0,1729559.0
73,"G: Right. Because for one thing, I mean, languages overlap a lot. There's often people who speak",1729560.0,1734599.0
73,multiple languages in a given place. And then how many languages are spoken in a given place is this,1734600.0,1740719.0
73,complicated question. There are way more languages than we have colours. We often use colours to,1740720.0,1747139.0
73,"display different concepts on a map, and it's really useful when it comes to nation states",1747140.0,1750559.0
73,"because you rarely have 20 nation states all bordering on each other, so you need to use like",1750560.0,1755059.0
73,20 colours. You can generally do this with I think it's five colours or so. But this is really hard,1755060.0,1760339.0
73,"with languages because there are not 7,000-ish colours that the human eye can distinguish.",1760340.0,1769039.0
73,Trying to map this gets really complicated. L: There are times when language mapping can,1769040.0,1773539.0
73,"be interesting. Often, on the show, we'll give examples from the World Atlas of Linguistic",1773540.0,1777859.0
73,"Structures, which looks at grammatical features that exist in a sample of the world's languages.",1777860.0,1784519.0
73,"Every language is reduced to one point on the map, which obviously from everything we've been",1784520.0,1789319.0
73,"talking about with our grad tour of continua of language, obviously a point doesn't really cut it.",1789320.0,1795139.0
73,Exactly what they're counting as a language varies depending on what they're documenting. But what's,1795140.0,1799339.0
73,really nice about these maps is that you get this big spread of dots. They're in two or three,1799340.0,1804739.0
73,"different colours depending on how many features you're comparing. So, for this show, I've linked",1804740.0,1808879.0
73,to one of my favourite WALS maps which is whether a language has the same word for 'hand' and 'arm',1808880.0,1814999.0
73,or a different word for 'hand' and 'arm.' G: Do you think it's related to whether,1815000.0,1819619.0
73,the climate wants you to wear long-sleeved clothing so that you see this distinction,1819620.0,1824539.0
73,between your hand and your arm? L: I've never thought about that,1824540.0,1827299.0
73,"before. What is really nice at this zoomed out, big picture level is that you can see",1827300.0,1834139.0
73,"that there are groups of languages that tend to do the same thing. Across Australia,",1834140.0,1839719.0
73,"languages tend to have different words for 'hand' and 'arm,' whereas across the Pacific, languages",1839720.0,1845479.0
73,"tend to have the same word for 'hand' and 'arm.' G: Right. Sometimes, these points can -- if you're",1845480.0,1851599.0
73,"trying to reduce 7,000 or even this map is like 500 languages, which is still a pretty good",1851600.0,1857839.0
73,"number, you're trying to reduce 500 data points to something that's visualisable. You can say,",1857840.0,1863479.0
73,"'Okay, well, we put each language as a dot, then we can see most of the languages in Western Europe",1863480.0,1868159.0
73,distinguish between 'hand' and 'arm.' There's a band of languages in Sub-Saharan Africa that don't,1868160.0,1872239.0
73,distinguish between them. Most of the languages in South America do distinguish between them.' You,1872240.0,1877279.0
73,can come up with these very quick evaluations of what the whole area looks like at the,1877280.0,1882139.0
73,"expense of reducing a language to a dot point. L: Exactly. There's a trade-off there, and I think",1882140.0,1887119.0
73,the important thing to always remember is what is the trade-off you're making with information,1887120.0,1891319.0
73,because it can be really difficult to use the limited vocabulary that we have for maps in,1891320.0,1897559.0
73,displaying the complexity of languages. There's this really beautiful map called 'native-land.ca',1897560.0,1903019.0
73,that focuses on the territories of Indigenous groups of people across the world. If you zoom,1903020.0,1907819.0
73,"in on North America, you can see this really beautiful texture of overlapping land and",1907820.0,1913999.0
73,"names and stories and territories. G: The overlapping polygons idea,",1914000.0,1918979.0
73,which is a really interesting way of representing the idea that multiple people can have been in an,1918980.0,1924439.0
73,"area at a given time, and it isn't necessarily like, 'Okay, this part's red; this part's blue;",1924440.0,1929599.0
73,and there's no purple in between.' You get these semi-translucent polygons that,1929600.0,1934339.0
73,overlap each other and show that multiple groups of people were in a particular area.,1934340.0,1939019.0
73,It's also hard to read. And especially would be even harder to read if you tried to represent even,1939020.0,1946519.0
73,more languages on it. This is a really interesting way of approaching this problem of just trying,1946520.0,1952879.0
73,to shade in particular areas is necessarily incomplete by doing these overlapping translucent,1952880.0,1959359.0
73,polygons. But I don't know if any mapping solution can ever display all of this information.,1959360.0,1963919.0
73,L: Having a sense when you're looking at any other way of mapping things that,1963920.0,1967939.0
73,there's probably more happening with the story is just a really good first start.,1967940.0,1971059.0
73,"G: I think if we can make one generalisation of this, it's that for all the problems",1971060.0,1974899.0
73,"that maps have, flags are even worse. L: Hmm, yes. Just representing a language",1974900.0,1981439.0
73,with a nation state flag is not a very effective way of doing things.,1981440.0,1986239.0
73,G: Because even with all the complexities that come with speech bands of continuums of particular,1986240.0,1992239.0
73,"languages, a flag is just gonna say, 'Everybody in this nation speaks the same language,' which is so",1992240.0,1997699.0
73,"far from being the case in so many circumstances. L: So, if languages aren't the map, and languages",1997700.0,2002379.0
73,"are certainly not flags, what are they? G: Well, I have another analogy that I'd",2002380.0,2006819.0
73,like to try on you. What if we thought of languages like stars?,2006820.0,2011739.0
73,L: Right. I'm a bit worried because we already are stretching the Lingthusiasm travel budget with our,2011740.0,2018519.0
73,global language survey but take us to the stars. G: I was thinking about this because I was trying,2018520.0,2026139.0
73,"to think about, you know, 7,000, it's kind of a big number, and yet it's also a number that",2026140.0,2030279.0
73,we should be able to get a handle on somehow because it's within human experience. What,2030280.0,2034179.0
73,"are other things that there are 7,000-ish of? I looked up how many stars are visible",2034180.0,2041379.0
73,with the naked eye from Earth. L: Okay. And how many is that?,2041380.0,2045039.0
73,"G: Well, if there's no light pollution, and you have 20/20 vision, you can see about 5,000 stars",2045040.0,2051699.0
73,"per side of the Earth, so 10,000 total. L: But like a similar order of magnitude",2051700.0,2057579.0
73,that we're talking about here. G: Right. And when you lie on your,2057580.0,2061179.0
73,"back in a dark, grassy field, and you look up at the stars, and you think,",2061180.0,2067299.0
73,"'Wow! There are so many of these pinpricks of light,' and each of these is an entire world,",2067300.0,2074199.0
73,"and each of these comes with, probably, planets, probably other things going on there. They seem",2074200.0,2080799.0
73,"far away, but there's so much going on with each of these. Each of these languages is an",2080800.0,2085899.0
73,entire world of things going on that's just as central to people who are speaking that language,2085900.0,2090759.0
73,as the sun is to me speaking my languages. L: I guess that means that for people who might,2090760.0,2098139.0
73,be in an area that's full of light pollution who might only see the brightest couple of,2098140.0,2103479.0
73,"hundred stars in the sky, I guess that's kind of the equivalent of the fact that,",2103480.0,2107079.0
73,"for most of our day-to-day life, we might only notice the 200 languages",2107080.0,2111459.0
73,that are on an online translation tool or the 30 languages that a website is available in.,2111460.0,2116859.0

73,"competing with it, and these are the big, famous languages that are often found in drop-down menus.",2121600.0,2128739.0
73,But then there's lots of other languages when you have the chance to actually see the,2128740.0,2133419.0
73,"full set. The other cool thing about this analogy is, have you seen the new photos",2133420.0,2138459.0
73,"of the galaxies that have been coming out? L: Oh, yeah, from that deep space telescope.",2138460.0,2142389.0
73,G: Yeah. They point the telescope at a dark patch of the sky that we didn't think we could see any,2142390.0,2148239.0
73,"stars in, and there were so many galaxies. L: I love the photos that compare the new",2148240.0,2154659.0

74,different grammatical shapes and,170700.0,172919.0
74,different patterns to how we articulate,172920.0,175018.0
74,them and one of the things that I think,175019.0,176878.0
74,is really cool about questions is the,176879.0,179219.0
74,way they cut across a bunch of different,179220.0,181139.0
74,linguistic subfields so there are things,181140.0,184499.0
74,about the words and the orders of the,184500.0,187859.0
74,words and their relationships with each,187860.0,188999.0
74,other when it comes to questions there,189000.0,190859.0
74,are also things about how you modulate,190860.0,192958.0
74,your voice the pitch of your voice to,192959.0,194399.0
74,make a question and then there are,194400.0,196018.0
74,things about how questions fit into,196019.0,197759.0
74,social situations so it really lets us,197760.0,200279.0
74,talk about a whole bunch of different,200280.0,201419.0
74,areas in linguistics under one simple uh,201420.0,205679.0
74,question,205680.0,207958.0
74,let's start with the tone of voice that,207959.0,209999.0
74,we use to ask a question so this is,210000.0,212399.0
74,question where your voice goes up at the,212400.0,215219.0
74,end to indicate that you're asking a,215220.0,217139.0
74,question right so this is sometimes,217140.0,218939.0
74,called question intonation this is the,218940.0,220679.0
74,way the intonation or the pitch of your,220680.0,222059.0
74,voice changes uh to make something into,222060.0,223979.0
74,a question and it's fairly common at,223980.0,227339.0
74,least in the languages that I've studied,227340.0,229378.0
74,to any degree to be like yeah well you,229379.0,231598.0
74,know here are some various grammatical,231599.0,233579.0
74,strategies to make questions or you can,233580.0,236039.0
74,just use questions intonation I.E making,236040.0,238499.0
74,the pitch of your voice rise towards the,238500.0,240359.0
74,end of the sentence and this is a common,240360.0,242279.0
74,strategy across languages but isn't,242280.0,244859.0
74,universally required well and actually,244860.0,248098.0
74,doing a rising intonation at the end of,248099.0,249899.0
74,a sentence to indicate a question isn't,249900.0,252539.0
74,even always an indicator of a question,252540.0,254279.0
74,in English no when I asked what is a,254280.0,257518.0
74,question I didn't have to use Rising,257519.0,259439.0
74,intonation because we had that question,259440.0,261599.0
74,word what there it was very clear that,261600.0,263819.0
74,it was acting as a question and I didn't,263820.0,265559.0
74,need that Rising intonation and in fact,265560.0,268019.0
74,if you had what is a question it would,268020.0,270299.0
74,almost have sounded like you didn't know,270300.0,271918.0
74,whether you wanted to be asking that,271919.0,274198.0
74,question it adds that uncertainty to it,274199.0,277198.0
74,right which is a thing that Rising,277199.0,278999.0
74,intonation can also do in English you,279000.0,281219.0
74,know if I say something like it's,281220.0,283138.0
74,raining out you might be asking but I,283139.0,285418.0
74,might also just be indicating,285419.0,286379.0
74,uncertainty about whether or not it's,286380.0,287698.0
74,raining so questions in English where,287699.0,290159.0
74,the structure of the words and how,290160.0,291478.0
74,they're put together already indicates,291479.0,293519.0
74,that it's a question are actually the,293520.0,295198.0
74,ones that often don't use that Rising,295199.0,297359.0
74,intonation for a question and it's,297360.0,299999.0
74,individual words or phrases that,300000.0,301918.0
74,otherwise you couldn't tell that they're,301919.0,303299.0
74,a question that's when this Rising,303300.0,304978.0
74,intonation shows up the most,304979.0,306599.0
74,there's also my favorite type of,306600.0,308698.0
74,question intonation which is the British,308699.0,311339.0
74,down step which sounds like an,311340.0,312959.0
74,old-fashioned dance actually now I say,312960.0,314698.0
74,it out loud,314699.0,316679.0
74,oh I love this one I think this is the,316680.0,318659.0
74,one that I pick up on whenever I'm,318660.0,320459.0
74,talking to British Speaking folks,320460.0,322319.0
74,because it just feels very contagious to,322320.0,324299.0
74,me would you like to give an example,324300.0,326939.0
74,would you like to give an example ah,326940.0,328978.0
74,there you are yeah that's sort of the,328979.0,330538.0
74,would you like a cup of tea yeah I find,330539.0,332939.0
74,myself very compelled by it as well it,332940.0,335038.0
74,is much more of a British form of,335039.0,337138.0
74,intonation than North American we don't,337139.0,339239.0
74,really have it in Australia either but,339240.0,341698.0
74,whenever I hang around British people,341699.0,343138.0
74,that do have this I feel really,343139.0,345719.0
74,compelled by it and I find myself using,345720.0,347698.0
74,it very easily yeah this is the one,347699.0,350399.0
74,that's got sort of on the final word,350400.0,353099.0
74,there's sort of a relatively sharp fall,353100.0,355258.0
74,in this little rise it's a little bit,355259.0,357418.0
74,hard to hear on T because that's just,357419.0,359159.0
74,one syllable but if you say something,359160.0,360478.0
74,with two syllables would you like cup of,360479.0,362758.0
74,coffee then you have the coffee going,362759.0,366599.0
74,down and then up again and you can get,366600.0,368939.0
74,this nice little shape which is really,368940.0,371339.0
74,fun would you like a banana would you,371340.0,374038.0
74,like an apple it's great I saw this,374039.0,377279.0
74,really interesting post about Meghan,377280.0,379499.0
74,Markle picking it up as a feature of her,379500.0,382219.0
74,increasingly British influenced accent,382220.0,385138.0
74,that made me feel really reassured that,385139.0,386879.0
74,it's not just me and the fact that you,386880.0,388559.0
74,also find it really compelling as well I,388560.0,391198.0
74,think you know to be honest when I first,391199.0,392519.0
74,met you I didn't know whether,392520.0,393478.0
74,Australians did this intonation or not,393479.0,395818.0
74,so I may have just been doing it around,395819.0,397258.0
74,you just to be extra careful uh extra,397259.0,400138.0
74,polite oh and because it's a very,400139.0,401939.0
74,satisfying intonation Contour,401940.0,404099.0
74,but intonation is only helpful for,404100.0,406619.0
74,making clear if something's a question,406620.0,408059.0
74,or not in spoken language and we use a,408060.0,411119.0
74,lot of written language as well yeah so,411120.0,413279.0
74,the you know classic indicator of this,413280.0,415978.0
74,Rising intonation this higher pitch at,415979.0,417719.0
74,the end is the question mark So if I'm,417720.0,419939.0
74,writing down you know to remind myself,419940.0,421918.0
74,tea coffee I could put a question mark,421919.0,424439.0
74,after each of those but because of how,424440.0,426538.0
74,the question mark indicates that Rising,426539.0,428159.0
74,intonation sometimes it's also used to,428160.0,431339.0
74,indicate this upwards pitch at the end,431340.0,432899.0
74,of the sentence even when the effect of,432900.0,434758.0
74,a question isn't intended and then the,434759.0,437038.0
74,inverse when you're asking a question,437039.0,438239.0
74,and you meet it sort of rhetorically or,438240.0,440098.0
74,ironically sometimes people especially,440099.0,442258.0
74,in more internet influence styles of,442259.0,444359.0
74,English don't write the question at all,444360.0,446159.0
74,and that's sort of a drier question or a,446160.0,448619.0
74,non-question that has the form of a,448620.0,450418.0
74,question because you can often tell it,450419.0,452579.0
74,from the order of the words or other,452580.0,454258.0
74,things about the wording oh I like this,454259.0,456779.0
74,as a diagnostic for the fact that we,456780.0,459359.0
74,have things that are grammatically,459360.0,460739.0
74,questions but there are a variety of,460740.0,463079.0
74,different reasons that we use question,463080.0,464939.0
74,structures and not all of them are for I,464940.0,467519.0
74,want some information from you right so,467520.0,469559.0
74,there's about five different ways that,469560.0,472198.0
74,some people talk about the form of a,472199.0,474239.0
74,question so exactly you have this asking,474240.0,476459.0
74,for information what time is it do you,476460.0,478258.0
74,have a pen and people often use a,478259.0,480119.0
74,question mark there there's also,480120.0,481799.0
74,requesting action okay so saying,481800.0,484318.0
74,something like could you give me that,484319.0,485638.0
74,and that sort of a polite question the,485639.0,487619.0
74,question has the effect of politeness or,487620.0,489659.0
74,would you give me a pen this is again,489660.0,492359.0
74,requesting a particular action I never,492360.0,494638.0
74,really thought about the fact that both,494639.0,496318.0
74,of those are asking but they're asking,496319.0,498538.0
74,very different types of things,498539.0,499499.0
74,information and asking someone to do,499500.0,501418.0
74,something yeah actually in Spanish,501419.0,503279.0
74,there's two different verbs that are,503280.0,505079.0
74,used to convey these different types of,505080.0,506878.0
74,asks ah so asking information is,506879.0,509159.0
74,pregnant,509160.0,512299.0
74,he asked me what time it was and this is,512300.0,515338.0
74,the asking for information but to,515339.0,517379.0
74,request an action of someone is pedir,517380.0,519478.0
74,okay,519479.0,521598.0
74,he asked me to write a letter and and,521599.0,524458.0
74,that's you know ask someone to do,524459.0,526259.0
74,something rather than ask someone about,526260.0,528179.0
74,something I love when you find a,528180.0,530939.0
74,structure in a language that makes,530940.0,532679.0
74,something clear that has a different,532680.0,534179.0
74,function to two things that just get,534180.0,536579.0
74,lumped together for English that's,536580.0,537838.0
74,really cool yeah it's really great and,537839.0,540479.0
74,then the other three kinds of questions,540480.0,543739.0
74,aren't really about asking at all and I,543740.0,547499.0
74,feel like tend to grow less and less,547500.0,549119.0
74,likely to use question marks when it,549120.0,550859.0
74,comes to the written versions because,550860.0,552299.0
74,the intonation is also doing very,552300.0,553919.0
74,different things so we have rhetorical,553920.0,556079.0
74,questions what can you expect you know,556080.0,558778.0
74,how could anyone possibly have known and,558779.0,561299.0
74,sometimes these are written with a,561300.0,562799.0
74,question mark still I think increasingly,562800.0,564838.0
74,in Internet Styles they're often not,564839.0,566699.0
74,written with a question mark as I,566700.0,568319.0
74,discussed in my book because internet uh,568320.0,571699.0
74,and then the other two that I think are,571700.0,574018.0
74,really interesting which I would really,574019.0,575579.0
74,not write with a question mark are,575580.0,578278.0
74,confirmation of known information so if,578279.0,581939.0
74,I say did you see that hmm I think I'd,581940.0,585659.0
74,put a punctuation mark like a,585660.0,588299.0
74,exclamation mark rather than a question,588300.0,590099.0
74,right exactly so I can say did you see,590100.0,592199.0
74,that and then let's ask you about,592200.0,593338.0
74,information but if I say did you see,593339.0,595199.0
74,that with sort of two down steps there I,595200.0,598439.0
74,think I'd write it with an exclamation,598440.0,599579.0
74,mark and then it's more about the,599580.0,601199.0
74,confirmation and then also there is the,601200.0,604018.0
74,intensification use something like what,604019.0,606778.0
74,a big dog would you look at that sunset,606779.0,609838.0
74,huh yeah I mean they have the structure,609839.0,612359.0
74,of a question and I don't even think of,612360.0,614699.0
74,those as questions right like I'm not,614700.0,617099.0
74,saying would you look at this sunset for,617100.0,618778.0
74,me and you know tell me why it's green,618779.0,620458.0
74,yeah okay you know requesting of action,620459.0,623879.0
74,would you look at this cup for me and,623880.0,626278.0
74,tell me if you think it's broken,626279.0,628079.0
74,um like those are real questions that,628080.0,630299.0
74,are asking for something but would you,630300.0,632099.0
74,look at that Sunset again it's got this,632100.0,635099.0
74,sort of choppier intonation and I think,635100.0,638338.0
74,I would again have to write that with an,638339.0,639599.0
74,exclamation mark so we have five,639600.0,641458.0
74,different functions and only the ones,641459.0,643559.0
74,that are soliciting information or,643560.0,645299.0
74,requesting actions we actually tend to,645300.0,648299.0
74,think of as really being questions even,648300.0,650639.0
74,though they all have the structure of a,650640.0,652078.0
74,question right sort of you know capital,652079.0,653759.0
74,Q questiony questions compared to the,653760.0,656219.0
74,sort of things that borrow from the,656220.0,658319.0
74,world of questions and are actually,658320.0,659578.0
74,accomplishing something else hmm,659579.0,662939.0
74,sort of gold standard you know capital Q,662940.0,665518.0
74,questioning questions sure we can,665519.0,668159.0
74,broadly divide questions into two,668160.0,670499.0
74,different types and they tend to have,670500.0,672599.0
74,different structures because they're,672600.0,674039.0
74,doing different things and the first,674040.0,676799.0
74,type are questions where we're just,676800.0,679379.0
74,soliciting like a yes no or a binary or,679380.0,683639.0
74,a polar question choice is is not you,683640.0,687359.0
74,know do do not do or do not there is no,687360.0,689939.0
74,try,689940.0,692119.0
74,so sometimes these get called polar,692120.0,694259.0
74,questions I think yes no questions may,694260.0,695639.0
74,be easier to keep track of from a,695640.0,697799.0
74,talking your lab perspective do you like,697800.0,699898.0
74,questions would be a great example yes I,699899.0,702719.0
74,do no I do not so this solicits an,702720.0,705299.0
74,answer that is either yes or no English,705300.0,707578.0
74,is kind of weird about these because,707579.0,709319.0
74,we've got this due there I think like,709320.0,712559.0
74,just as a spoiler English is weird about,712560.0,715199.0
74,questions in general we're going to say,715200.0,717059.0
74,this with all the question structures I,717060.0,719338.0
74,have questions about English and,719339.0,720838.0
74,questions I have so many questions about,720839.0,722578.0
74,English,722579.0,723239.0
74,a more typical language for yes no,723240.0,725699.0
74,questions might be doing something more,725700.0,727139.0
74,like Italian where you have you know,727140.0,729419.0
74,here's the statement that you're saying,729420.0,730619.0
74,but you've put a question mark after it,730620.0,732059.0
74,so something like staibene uh which is,732060.0,735239.0
74,literally like you are good but you've,735240.0,737518.0
74,made it a question and I can either,737519.0,739199.0
74,answer C yes or no no or something like,739200.0,743699.0
74,parlano Italiano they speak Italian SI,743700.0,747119.0
74,no no and you know here the they or the,747120.0,750479.0
74,you there is not said aloud because,750480.0,752939.0
74,Italian doesn't need them but that's not,752940.0,754439.0
74,the part that makes them more typical as,754440.0,755699.0
74,a question it's just here's the,755700.0,757078.0
74,statement that you're making,757079.0,758458.0
74,um and you can make it into a question,758459.0,759539.0
74,they are not adding a word like do or,759540.0,762299.0
74,moving a word like are you good uh are,762300.0,765599.0
74,you okay they're not doing any of that,765600.0,768059.0
74,stuff it's just you can just say it but,768060.0,770458.0
74,say it with the question intonation it's,770459.0,772799.0
74,fine so if I see a group of people and I,772800.0,775739.0
74,say parlano Italiano do they speak,775740.0,778138.0
74,Italian and then they all start speaking,778139.0,779759.0
74,Italian I can say palano Italiano and I,779760.0,782759.0
74,don't have to change change anything,782760.0,783898.0
74,about the order of those words for it to,783899.0,786599.0
74,be yes a statement they do speak Italian,786600.0,788838.0
74,and you can do this in English make yes,788839.0,791458.0
74,no questions you can say something like,791459.0,792958.0
74,you good yeah you're good or they speak,792959.0,795359.0
74,Italian they speak Italian and you can,795360.0,797578.0
74,do this in intonation with English but,797579.0,799679.0
74,it's not as much of the default strategy,799680.0,801599.0
74,the default strategy is like you've got,801600.0,803759.0
74,to do other stuff with do and moving,803760.0,805679.0
74,words around definitely much more,805680.0,807359.0
74,informal to do that kind of question,807360.0,809159.0
74,structure and it sort of implies in,809160.0,811619.0
74,English that you expect the answer to be,811620.0,813419.0
74,yes if you say something like they speak,813420.0,815518.0
74,Italian they speak Italian oh yeah I,815519.0,817619.0
74,never thought about that but I feel like,817620.0,819539.0
74,that makes sense whereas if you say do,819540.0,821398.0
74,they speak Italian you're sort of more,821399.0,822659.0
74,open for the answer to be yes or no and,822660.0,824999.0
74,I think that intonation has a more,825000.0,827159.0
74,neutral connotation in languages where,827160.0,828539.0
74,that's the default strategy it's not the,828540.0,830458.0
74,only way to do yes no questions by any,830459.0,832499.0
74,stretch of the imagination I find it,832500.0,834479.0
74,very convenient that Mandarin Chinese,834480.0,835979.0
74,uses two other really common strategies,835980.0,838259.0
74,that we can talk about one of them being,838260.0,840299.0
74,just a particle that says hey I'm doing,840300.0,842578.0
74,a question right now right so Mandarin's,842579.0,845458.0
74,got this great word ma which just means,845459.0,847859.0
74,this is a question now so you can add it,847860.0,849898.0
74,to something like Nihao which is you,849899.0,852419.0
74,good literally and you get Nihao Ma and,852420.0,855778.0
74,the ma there means like you good,855779.0,858599.0
74,question are you good are you okay how,858600.0,861179.0
74,are you effectively but it's just adding,861180.0,863458.0
74,this is a question now it's very elegant,863459.0,866039.0
74,it's very straightforward you can add it,866040.0,868319.0
74,to lots of different kinds of sentences,868320.0,869699.0
74,and just get this is now the yes no,869700.0,872518.0
74,version of this question and I think,872519.0,874259.0
74,there are quite a lot of languages that,874260.0,875578.0
74,have some sort of question particle,875579.0,876898.0
74,that's like yup now this is a question,876899.0,878759.0
74,yeah very common to have one either at,878760.0,881159.0
74,the beginning or the end of a sentence,881160.0,883078.0
74,particularly they're good spots to put,883079.0,884999.0
74,your question particles Mandarin also,885000.0,887338.0
74,has this other construction where you,887339.0,889739.0
74,put the yes part and the no part in the,889740.0,892259.0
74,question together so you have the yes,892260.0,894659.0
74,version of a verb and the no version of,894660.0,896338.0
74,a verb together so something like do you,896339.0,899039.0
74,want tea the do you want part would be,899040.0,901739.0
74,Yao,901740.0,903479.0
74,so that's literally something like want,903480.0,905638.0
74,not want yeah and so someone says do you,905639.0,909539.0
74,want or not want tea as the default,909540.0,912119.0
74,question structure and then you say,912120.0,915259.0
74,I want or I don't want right and again,915260.0,918299.0
74,this is sort of making explicit you know,918300.0,920939.0
74,a yes no question is giving you a choice,920940.0,922799.0
74,between two options you know do you want,922800.0,924898.0
74,this or not but in English if you want,924899.0,926518.0
74,to say like do you want this or not you,926519.0,927958.0
74,still have to have that do there and,927959.0,929819.0
74,it's right there and in the world,929820.0,931979.0
74,languages that is a very uncommon,931980.0,934078.0
74,structure we'll post the world atlas of,934079.0,936539.0
74,linguistic structures map of which you,936540.0,938458.0
74,see English as a little dot that's a,938459.0,940619.0
74,very different color to most of the,940620.0,941819.0
74,other things around it because it has a,941820.0,943679.0
74,very unusual question structure so,943680.0,945659.0
74,historically in English it was a little,945660.0,947879.0
74,bit more straightforward in that you,947880.0,949499.0
74,just put the verb at the beginning of,949500.0,951179.0
74,the sentence so if you say something,951180.0,953698.0
74,like have you the time Where in,953699.0,957239.0
74,present-day English you'd have to say,957240.0,958619.0
74,something like do you have the time but,958620.0,960719.0
74,in sort of Shakespeare which is early,960720.0,962638.0
74,modern English and end earlier and still,962639.0,965578.0
74,in languages like German you can say,965579.0,968099.0
74,something like have you the time or you,968100.0,970259.0
74,know watch you the video or see you this,970260.0,973919.0
74,fish or something like that watch you,973920.0,975838.0
74,the video being a classic line from,975839.0,977398.0
74,Shakespeare,977399.0,978859.0
74,Shakespeare was so big into watching,978860.0,980939.0
74,videos watch you this play,980940.0,984299.0
74,and then what happened in English is,984300.0,986518.0
74,that we kept the ability to put the verb,986519.0,989338.0
74,at the beginning of the sentence only,989339.0,991078.0
74,for auxiliary verbs so you can say are,991079.0,993419.0
74,you watching the video can you watch the,993420.0,995698.0
74,video you know might you watch the video,995699.0,997859.0
74,have you seen the video but you don't,997860.0,1000739.0
74,have the ability to just say see you the,1000740.0,1002599.0
74,video or watch you the video anymore and,1002600.0,1004939.0
74,that's where the do comes in because do,1004940.0,1006559.0
74,is sort of this lightweight thing that,1006560.0,1007999.0
74,you can just put in if you've got to,1008000.0,1009739.0
74,move something to the front of the,1009740.0,1010999.0
74,sentence but your verb is too heavy,1011000.0,1012919.0
74,thank you,1012920.0,1014898.0
74,so yeah so English has sort of ended up,1014899.0,1016638.0
74,and down this interesting historical,1016639.0,1017958.0
74,pathway but that means that when you go,1017959.0,1021499.0
74,to learn another language from English,1021500.0,1022939.0
74,you're always saying all right well I'm,1022940.0,1025578.0
74,like really really confident it's not,1025579.0,1027739.0
74,gonna do the do thing that English does,1027740.0,1029418.0
74,for like Arcane historical reasons it's,1029419.0,1032119.0
74,gonna do something else a more normal,1032120.0,1033979.0
74,thing like intonation or having a,1033980.0,1035719.0
74,question particle and this is also true,1035720.0,1038359.0
74,for our other main type of questions our,1038360.0,1041178.0
74,first type of question was do you have,1041179.0,1043219.0
74,the time yes no kind of forced choice to,1043220.0,1045918.0
74,answer our second type of question asks,1045919.0,1048558.0
74,for a more open but particular piece of,1048559.0,1050839.0
74,information like what is the time or,1050840.0,1053599.0
74,when are you coming over so these,1053600.0,1055819.0
74,questions use words like who what where,1055820.0,1058399.0
74,when why and how which are often called,1058400.0,1061219.0
74,wh words in English because most of them,1061220.0,1063139.0
74,except for Hal begin with wh and so,1063140.0,1065659.0
74,linguists sometimes refer to these,1065660.0,1066918.0
74,questions as wh questions for that,1066919.0,1068298.0
74,reason which is super a piece of,1068299.0,1070639.0
74,terminology that doesn't really hold up,1070640.0,1073159.0
74,across other languages but it's easy to,1073160.0,1076339.0
74,remember so we're gonna keep it for now,1076340.0,1078219.0
74,and for English questions like what time,1078220.0,1081439.0
74,is it where are we meeting that wh word,1081440.0,1084798.0
74,is always at the start of the question,1084799.0,1087019.0
74,that you're asking I feel like we're,1087020.0,1088759.0
74,arranging like a secret assignment or,1088760.0,1090859.0
74,something like that you know where are,1090860.0,1092479.0
74,we going to be will you have the letter,1092480.0,1093918.0
74,and what time where who's going to meet,1093919.0,1096798.0
74,us Oh I thought we were just catching up,1096799.0,1098959.0
74,for coffee and cake you have a much more,1098960.0,1101058.0
74,uh sinister-minded motive behind all,1101059.0,1103639.0
74,these questions than I do I like to,1103640.0,1105739.0
74,think of my cake assignations is very,1105740.0,1107538.0
74,important yes,1107539.0,1108918.0
74,is,1108919.0,1109939.0
74,but we're putting all those wh words at,1109940.0,1112099.0
74,the start regardless of the nature of,1112100.0,1114558.0
74,the appointment that we're keeping and,1114559.0,1116418.0
74,in principle right these wh words are,1116419.0,1118939.0
74,are at the beginning in questions in,1118940.0,1120558.0
74,English you know who's going to be there,1120559.0,1122239.0
74,or what time but also the answers to all,1122240.0,1125659.0
74,of those have the answer towards the end,1125660.0,1128178.0
74,of the sentence so you are aware you're,1128179.0,1131298.0
74,at the cafe let's meet when let's meet,1131299.0,1134418.0
74,at two o'clock you're meeting who we're,1134419.0,1137418.0
74,meeting our friends of secret agents,1137419.0,1139099.0
74,obviously,1139100.0,1140479.0
74,just for a fun little secret agent tea,1140480.0,1142519.0
74,and Cake which is a possible but not the,1142520.0,1145038.0
74,typical way of asking these questions as,1145039.0,1147019.0
74,well and really just shows that the,1147020.0,1148699.0
74,information doesn't always have to be at,1148700.0,1150619.0
74,the start even though we tend to put it,1150620.0,1152058.0
74,at the start for a question structure,1152059.0,1153619.0
74,and like a lot of European languages,1153620.0,1155719.0
74,like to do this thing where those wh,1155720.0,1157579.0
74,Words which don't begin with wh in most,1157580.0,1160099.0
74,of these other languages go to the,1160100.0,1162678.0
74,beginning of the sentence but not all,1162679.0,1164719.0
74,the Indo-European languages because the,1164720.0,1166639.0
74,indic languages so Hindi I think Nepali,1166640.0,1169819.0
74,as well probably a lot of languages in,1169820.0,1171678.0
74,that area don't allow you to move those,1171679.0,1174499.0
74,wh words the beginning of the sentence,1174500.0,1176239.0
74,that's right in Nepali the wh words are,1176240.0,1179298.0
74,K words if we'd started with Nepali,1179299.0,1181759.0
74,grammarians doing the world's linguistic,1181760.0,1184038.0
74,diversity we'd be talking about K words,1184039.0,1185779.0
74,you know to be honest like in,1185780.0,1188239.0
74,Indo-European in general a lot of these,1188240.0,1189918.0
74,words begin with a k sound or like a q u,1189919.0,1192019.0
74,or a c this would be a lot more,1192020.0,1194659.0
74,typologically valid at least for one,1194660.0,1196639.0
74,language family it's just very,1196640.0,1199279.0
74,english-centric that we're talking about,1199280.0,1200839.0
74,wh words instead of like KW Words which,1200840.0,1203538.0
74,is the more at least for for one very,1203539.0,1206178.0
74,large language family accurate way of,1206179.0,1207979.0
74,talking about them so in Nepali if you,1207980.0,1210918.0
74,say Hami,1210919.0,1212739.0
74,that kaha is where Hami Cafe we meet at,1212740.0,1217459.0
74,the cafe and you don't change the word,1217460.0,1219379.0
74,order at all which again is a lot more,1219380.0,1223099.0
74,of a simple solution than English is,1223100.0,1225139.0
74,moving of it yeah I had to interestingly,1225140.0,1228379.0
74,sort of unlearn this in French because,1228380.0,1230119.0
74,in school and French you learn oh yeah,1230120.0,1231798.0
74,you know you move all those wh words the,1231799.0,1234319.0
74,q-u words to the beginning of the,1234320.0,1235759.0
74,sentence,1235760.0,1237079.0
74,um which is still the sort of formal,1237080.0,1238639.0
74,French way to do it but in conversation,1238640.0,1240259.0
74,most of the time people don't actually,1240260.0,1241879.0
74,move them and you sound more natural if,1241880.0,1243619.0
74,you don't move them so there are some,1243620.0,1245659.0
74,languages where it's sort of optional,1245660.0,1246798.0
74,like French there's some languages where,1246799.0,1248298.0
74,you really do move them almost all the,1248299.0,1249979.0
74,time like in English and then there's,1249980.0,1251599.0
74,some language there's really nobody ever,1251600.0,1253279.0
74,moves them at all and that's more like,1253280.0,1255019.0
74,Nepali I like the slight outrage that,1255020.0,1257899.0
74,comes with English if you don't move it,1257900.0,1259639.0
74,like you are where yeah,1259640.0,1261619.0
74,like I am I'm outraged that you're not,1261620.0,1264139.0
74,at the cafe where we're meant to be,1264140.0,1265519.0
74,meeting and that's similar to how in,1265520.0,1267798.0
74,English if you're asking yes no,1267799.0,1269178.0
74,questions just with intonation you like,1269179.0,1272298.0
74,cake it sounds sort of incredulous or,1272299.0,1274759.0
74,like you expect a particular direction,1274760.0,1276319.0
74,of the answer rather than being a,1276320.0,1278298.0
74,default strategy that is more,1278299.0,1279499.0
74,pragmatically unmarked or more,1279500.0,1281119.0
74,programmatically neutral and once again,1281120.0,1282918.0
74,it's worth just pointing out that,1282919.0,1284178.0
74,English has the less common way of doing,1284179.0,1287418.0
74,questions in the world atlas of,1287419.0,1289519.0
74,linguistic structures there are more,1289520.0,1290839.0
74,than twice as many languages where,1290840.0,1292579.0
74,moving the wh word to the front is not,1292580.0,1295999.0
74,what's done there are a lot of languages,1296000.0,1297859.0
74,that do it but not all and by no stretch,1297860.0,1300499.0
74,of the imagination and also that,1300500.0,1303199.0
74,sometimes we move for wh questions in,1303200.0,1305899.0
74,English both the do and the wh word so,1305900.0,1309379.0
74,if you're saying something like why,1309380.0,1310699.0
74,don't you come you've got to do in there,1310700.0,1312979.0
74,like we saw earlier and you put a wh,1312980.0,1314839.0
74,word ah and again the do thing that's,1314840.0,1318859.0
74,just not what other languages do it's,1318860.0,1322038.0
74,like English was designed to keep syntax,1322039.0,1323899.0
74,people really busy and happy that's my,1323900.0,1326058.0
74,that's my theory speaking of things that,1326059.0,1328339.0
74,keep syntacticians really happy there's,1328340.0,1330259.0
74,another thing you can do for questions,1330260.0,1331639.0
74,okay and this is maybe my favorite,1331640.0,1334879.0
74,question thing because they're so,1334880.0,1336019.0
74,versatile and they're fun and you can,1336020.0,1337519.0
74,sort of do lots of things with them,1337520.0,1339379.0
74,they're a little more flexible and these,1339380.0,1341839.0
74,are Tag questions oh they sound fun so,1341840.0,1345558.0
74,this is when you have you know a main,1345559.0,1347599.0
74,sentence like a sort of a normal,1347600.0,1349699.0
74,sentence and then you can add a little,1349700.0,1351319.0
74,extra thing at the end to make it into a,1351320.0,1353418.0
74,question that is sort of tacked on like,1353419.0,1355519.0
74,a little little tag on a piece of,1355520.0,1357379.0
74,clothing to make it more questiony so,1357380.0,1360199.0
74,the classic very formal English example,1360200.0,1362418.0
74,is saying something like isn't it so,1362419.0,1364219.0
74,it's cold isn't it Tag questions are,1364220.0,1366678.0
74,interesting aren't they right but,1366679.0,1369079.0
74,there's more fun versions oh so you can,1369080.0,1371719.0
74,say like it's colder right oh yeah it's,1371720.0,1373999.0
74,doing the same thing with an even,1374000.0,1375259.0
74,shorter tag yeah and I think it's that,1375260.0,1377959.0
74,little pause maybe before the Thai,1377960.0,1379459.0
74,question that distinguishes it from you,1379460.0,1381499.0
74,just have a question word that's sort of,1381500.0,1383058.0
74,the default way of asking a question,1383059.0,1384319.0
74,because it's cold out right or it's cold,1384320.0,1387079.0
74,out isn't it again sort of expects an,1387080.0,1389298.0
74,answer in a particular direction and has,1389299.0,1392058.0
74,this little pause before it one of my,1392059.0,1393979.0
74,favorites from the britishism Department,1393980.0,1395359.0
74,is the contraction of isn't it which is,1395360.0,1398178.0
74,in it ah yes so it's cold isn't it I'm,1398179.0,1401779.0
74,probably not saying that as britishly as,1401780.0,1403699.0
74,people who actually have that in their,1403700.0,1405678.0
74,native dialects too I like that in it,1405679.0,1407899.0
74,has just become so stable and contracted,1407900.0,1410719.0
74,that you can use it in a variety of,1410720.0,1412639.0
74,places where you'd have to have a,1412640.0,1413899.0
74,different tag for something else like,1413900.0,1416479.0
74,Tag questions are interesting isn't it,1416480.0,1418579.0
74,which again I am absolutely not the,1418580.0,1420439.0
74,right kind of British English speaker to,1420440.0,1422239.0
74,pull that off,1422240.0,1423499.0
74,whereas with the fork tag I needed to,1423500.0,1425959.0
74,say aren't they and have the aunt match,1425960.0,1428418.0
74,the plural of Tag questions in it has,1428419.0,1431298.0
74,just become its own solid little tag by,1431299.0,1433939.0
74,itself yeah which is again the cool,1433940.0,1436339.0
74,thing about tag is you can just keep,1436340.0,1437658.0
74,putting stuff in tags because they're,1437659.0,1439699.0
74,sort of more versatile and flexible like,1439700.0,1441558.0
74,English is stuck with this weird do,1441559.0,1443178.0
74,situation for complicated historic,1443179.0,1445339.0
74,reasons but you could just keep,1445340.0,1446359.0
74,innovating and make in it and it's,1446360.0,1447739.0
74,really fun another fun tag question is,1447740.0,1450439.0
74,in Japanese the Thai question form is NE,1450440.0,1453558.0
74,oh that's definitely a thing I hear in,1453559.0,1457158.0
74,Japanese TV shows yeah and I've seen,1457159.0,1460399.0
74,speculation online that the nay in,1460400.0,1463399.0
74,Japanese is somehow related to,1463400.0,1465459.0
74,Portuguese which also has a tag question,1465460.0,1468319.0
74,in there which comes from isn't it like,1468320.0,1472239.0
74,but unfortunately I looked up this,1472240.0,1475279.0
74,etymology and it seems like this is an,1475280.0,1476719.0
74,accident like this is just convergent,1476720.0,1478038.0
74,evolution sometimes things resemble each,1478039.0,1480259.0
74,other and they're not actually related,1480260.0,1481579.0
74,so it would have been cool if it was but,1481580.0,1484279.0
74,it seems like it's not and it's just one,1484280.0,1486379.0
74,of those things where Tag questions tend,1486380.0,1488359.0
74,to be really short and reduced and get,1488360.0,1490699.0
74,shorter as people use them more and more,1490700.0,1492979.0
74,so perhaps unsurprising you get them,1492980.0,1495199.0
74,with the same shape across different,1495200.0,1496699.0
74,languages yeah exactly and I think I,1496700.0,1499519.0
74,need to say my favorite tag question as,1499520.0,1501619.0
74,a Canadian is obviously a Canadian a oh,1501620.0,1504798.0
74,yeah of course which is a very short and,1504799.0,1507439.0
74,reduced form obviously it's just one,1507440.0,1508639.0
74,vowel and the cool thing about a is that,1508640.0,1511939.0
74,it's a bit different from how other Tag,1511940.0,1514579.0
74,questions are used in English,1514580.0,1516279.0
74,because other Tag questions in English,1516280.0,1519139.0
74,you can't put them on sentences that are,1519140.0,1522319.0
74,already questions okay so if you say,1522320.0,1525019.0
74,something like did you see the game last,1525020.0,1526819.0
74,night did you,1526820.0,1529158.0
74,you sound very insistent but it,1529159.0,1531259.0
74,definitely doesn't feel like a tag,1531260.0,1532639.0
74,question right or what are you trying to,1532640.0,1535579.0
74,say are you okay that definitely does,1535580.0,1537739.0
74,not work that just crashes yeah or using,1537740.0,1541339.0
74,right for your tag question did you see,1541340.0,1543139.0
74,the game last night right okay that,1543140.0,1545599.0
74,works as a tag question in the examples,1545600.0,1547759.0
74,we had before and not there because it's,1547760.0,1549619.0
74,a question already but a can be added to,1549620.0,1554359.0
74,both yes no questions and wh questions,1554360.0,1557119.0
74,and it's still okay,1557120.0,1559219.0
74,so did you see the game last night eh,1559220.0,1561798.0
74,this is fine for me that sounds like a,1561799.0,1564918.0
74,thing a Canadian would say I perhaps,1564919.0,1567379.0
74,don't have the best intuitions about,1567380.0,1568819.0
74,this uh or what are you trying to say,1568820.0,1570678.0
74,this also sounds totally fine to my,1570679.0,1573079.0
74,Canadian years so this is something,1573080.0,1575538.0
74,that's sort of unique about a that it,1575539.0,1577639.0
74,can also be added as a tag question to,1577640.0,1580519.0
74,another question where most Tag,1580520.0,1582139.0
74,questions in English don't let you do,1582140.0,1583339.0
74,that oh it's very flexible isn't it,1583340.0,1585259.0
74,great eh,1585260.0,1586479.0
74,the other cool thing about questions as,1586480.0,1589278.0
74,well as their intonation and their,1589279.0,1590599.0
74,grammar is how they get really,1590600.0,1593298.0
74,interesting when we look at how they're,1593299.0,1594739.0
74,used in the conversation context ah you,1594740.0,1598158.0
74,know like my hobby which is well it's,1598159.0,1600439.0
74,interpreting the semantic structure of a,1600440.0,1602359.0
74,question while ignoring the pragmatic,1602360.0,1604339.0
74,context ah can you give me an example of,1604340.0,1607099.0
74,that yes,1607100.0,1608778.0
74,okay you've established that you could,1608779.0,1610939.0
74,give me an example of that and I feel,1610940.0,1613278.0
74,like by not volunteering the example,1613279.0,1615439.0
74,when I asked that question and treating,1615440.0,1617298.0
74,it as a yes no question with no other,1617299.0,1618979.0
74,request for information uh has really,1618980.0,1621379.0
74,proven your point good job I really have,1621380.0,1623658.0
74,ignored the pragmatic context which is,1623659.0,1625699.0
74,often people ask a yes no question and,1625700.0,1628219.0
74,they're looking for an answer that's,1628220.0,1629359.0
74,longer than just yes or no,1629360.0,1631939.0
74,I didn't come up with this this is a,1631940.0,1633379.0
74,meme that makes its way around the,1633380.0,1634519.0
74,internet in various formats I think it's,1634520.0,1636499.0
74,really great though a self-effidencing,1636500.0,1638778.0
74,example is always a true Delight,1638779.0,1640719.0
74,absolutely this idea that oftentimes,1640720.0,1644239.0
74,when we're asking what seems to be a yes,1644240.0,1646038.0
74,no question we're actually expecting and,1646039.0,1648979.0
74,often providing more information than,1648980.0,1651259.0
74,that made me feel really validated in a,1651260.0,1654319.0
74,thread on Twitter from the linguist Liz,1654320.0,1656298.0
74,stoko who pointed out that when you,1656299.0,1659778.0
74,actually look at questions in the wild,1659779.0,1661759.0
74,in use in corpora oftentimes people,1661760.0,1665178.0
74,actually do answer a yes no question,1665179.0,1667099.0
74,with more than just yes or no in,1667100.0,1669379.0
74,response because as we've just,1669380.0,1671119.0
74,established to not do so comes across,1671120.0,1673519.0
74,really really weird right and unhelpful,1673520.0,1676278.0
74,in the conversation right so a few,1676279.0,1678558.0
74,examples that she has from Context do,1678559.0,1680719.0
74,you have pets I mean my answer is no but,1680720.0,1683719.0
74,then I feel like I have to give you like,1683720.0,1685759.0
74,the reason why we don't have pets based,1685760.0,1688879.0
74,on various factors so like even with a,1688880.0,1691278.0
74,no I already feel feel like I'm opening,1691279.0,1693319.0
74,up more about that and the answer in her,1693320.0,1695538.0
74,Corpus is yes two cats which I know you,1695539.0,1697819.0
74,don't have two cats but that's the kind,1697820.0,1699199.0
74,of thing that people say when they do,1699200.0,1700459.0
74,have pets yeah I was gonna read from,1700460.0,1702439.0
74,real script and I was like but then,1702440.0,1703819.0
74,people will think I have two cats and I,1703820.0,1705379.0
74,don't so like complicated reasons it's,1705380.0,1707599.0
74,not that I don't like pets here we go,1707600.0,1709939.0
74,yeah yeah but yeah like as soon as,1709940.0,1711678.0
74,someone says true cats you go oh that's,1711679.0,1713538.0
74,like do they hang out together suddenly,1713539.0,1715399.0
74,you have like an in to asking more,1715400.0,1717379.0
74,questions exactly because people always,1717380.0,1719058.0
74,love to talk about their pets and the,1719059.0,1721219.0
74,same thing with asking someone do they,1721220.0,1722658.0
74,have kids people will often start,1722659.0,1724278.0
74,talking about specifically their kids,1724279.0,1725719.0
74,and their ages and these sorts of things,1725720.0,1727399.0
74,rather than just say yes or no in a very,1727400.0,1730699.0
74,blunt sort of way yeah if I call up and,1730700.0,1733158.0
74,say can I make an appointment at the,1733159.0,1735019.0
74,hairdressers they're not just going to,1735020.0,1736759.0
74,say yes and then like that's it they're,1736760.0,1738798.0
74,going to be like yes when are you,1738799.0,1740538.0
74,available what would you like to have,1740539.0,1742038.0
74,done and especially when the answer is a,1742039.0,1745278.0
74,little bit more dispreferred if it's,1745279.0,1747139.0
74,something that you feel a bit socially,1747140.0,1748158.0
74,awkward about so stoko has this example,1748159.0,1750798.0
74,with a salesperson a client saying and,1750799.0,1753499.0
74,do you have internet access at all Mr,1753500.0,1754879.0
74,Jones and the client says uh yeah the,1754880.0,1756859.0
74,wife's got a laptop and that really,1756860.0,1758778.0
74,conveys some particular things about you,1758779.0,1761778.0
74,know Mr Jones and his relationship to,1761779.0,1763099.0
74,the internet which is like he's sort of,1763100.0,1765079.0
74,online but maybe not very online rather,1765080.0,1767839.0
74,than just yes technically there's,1767840.0,1770178.0
74,internet access in their household yeah,1770179.0,1772278.0
74,he doesn't seem to be really uh looking,1772279.0,1774619.0
74,for it there and there's actually a,1774620.0,1776719.0
74,really great example also from Stoko's,1776720.0,1778999.0
74,Corpus about someone doing this very,1779000.0,1781519.0
74,literal yes answer to yes no questions,1781520.0,1783979.0
74,in a way that makes the other person,1783980.0,1786199.0
74,prod for information okay should we do a,1786200.0,1789379.0
74,little radio play of it yeah so this is,1789380.0,1791538.0
74,in a cafe you have a cafe customer a,1791539.0,1793639.0
74,cafe staff and the customer says do you,1793640.0,1795979.0
74,have Wi-Fi yes we do uh can customers,1795980.0,1799819.0
74,use it yes they can,1799820.0,1802038.0
74,uh do I need a code or apparently,1802039.0,1805459.0
74,according to this I point to the place,1805460.0,1806839.0
74,on the wall where the code is oh thanks,1806840.0,1809239.0
74,so most of the time I think when a,1809240.0,1811819.0
74,customer says do you have Wi-Fi they're,1811820.0,1813319.0
74,saying and how do I get on it or what's,1813320.0,1815599.0
74,the password yeah not just yep okay so,1815600.0,1819139.0
74,so I can use it okay but like how do I,1819140.0,1821658.0
74,do that that really strikes me as a,1821659.0,1823639.0
74,staff member who is very sick of,1823640.0,1825079.0
74,pointing to the sign,1825080.0,1827119.0
74,and you see how immediately unhelpful,1827120.0,1829339.0
74,that is and I feel like this research,1829340.0,1832038.0
74,and these observations are really,1832039.0,1833239.0
74,helpful because I feel like there's a,1833240.0,1835639.0
74,kind of teaching you how to do,1835640.0,1837439.0
74,conversation that's like ask open,1837440.0,1838999.0
74,questions these yes no questions really,1839000.0,1841339.0
74,trap people into locked answers yeah and,1841340.0,1844459.0
74,if we actually analyze what people are,1844460.0,1845778.0
74,doing in conversation it turns out that,1845779.0,1847999.0
74,asking a yes no question people will,1848000.0,1850099.0
74,often continue volunteering information,1850100.0,1851538.0
74,or provide a springboard for doing that,1851539.0,1854599.0
74,rather than saying to somebody you know,1854600.0,1856699.0
74,do you have kids and if so how many and,1856700.0,1858558.0
74,what are their ages saying do you have,1858559.0,1860959.0
74,kids will often lead people into,1860960.0,1862158.0
74,volunteering how many and what their,1862159.0,1864019.0
74,ages are in these sorts of additions,1864020.0,1865759.0
74,onto the questions and there's this post,1865760.0,1867739.0
74,about using yes no questions in like a,1867740.0,1870439.0
74,Psychotherapy context where you're,1870440.0,1871879.0
74,trying to have people open up but,1871880.0,1873979.0
74,sometimes saying you know do you feel,1873980.0,1875898.0
74,this particular way can be a way of,1875899.0,1878058.0
74,someone talking about their feelings,1878059.0,1879499.0
74,more or even asking a question like can,1879500.0,1882019.0
74,you tell me more which in its form looks,1882020.0,1885079.0
74,like it's kind of a yes no question you,1885080.0,1886759.0
74,know can you tell me more yes now I'm,1886760.0,1889459.0
74,gonna stop talking it probably actually,1889460.0,1891918.0
74,has the effect of saying you know I'd,1891919.0,1894019.0
74,like you to tell me more please tell me,1894020.0,1895579.0
74,more but sometimes phrased in a more,1895580.0,1897558.0
74,polite way so getting really hung up on,1897559.0,1899959.0
74,the difference between this sort of oh,1899960.0,1901939.0
74,you have to ask questions with wh words,1901940.0,1903918.0
74,in them because that's the only kind of,1903919.0,1905239.0
74,open question doesn't actually seem to,1905240.0,1907099.0
74,be how conversation is structured when,1907100.0,1908898.0
74,you look what people are actually doing,1908899.0,1910158.0
74,in fact the more important thing is just,1910159.0,1912439.0
74,to think about who is likely to have,1912440.0,1915319.0
74,information and who has the right to ask,1915320.0,1917839.0
74,questions and who has the right to,1917840.0,1919099.0
74,answer questions this brings us to a,1919100.0,1921139.0
74,really interesting thing that speakers,1921140.0,1922278.0
74,of yellow didn't do which is a language,1922279.0,1924798.0
74,spoken in Russell island of Papua New,1924799.0,1926839.0
74,Guinea and they don't use the structural,1926840.0,1928879.0
74,things that we talked about to Mark a,1928880.0,1930979.0
74,question whether it's a question word or,1930980.0,1932479.0
74,changing the word order but they use,1932480.0,1934459.0
74,instead a deep understanding of the,1934460.0,1936379.0
74,social context and they don't use,1936380.0,1938599.0
74,question intonation either so that's all,1938600.0,1941058.0
74,the strategies we've discussed so far,1941059.0,1942558.0
74,having ways of rearranging or adding,1942559.0,1944778.0
74,words or using intonation to mark,1944779.0,1946699.0
74,question,1946700.0,1947439.0
74,so their questions really are identical,1947440.0,1951019.0
74,to statements but people can still tell,1951020.0,1953839.0
74,if a question is being asked because of,1953840.0,1955999.0
74,the informational mismatch between what,1956000.0,1959119.0
74,you think the other person is likely to,1959120.0,1961459.0
74,know right so if you assume the person,1961460.0,1964699.0
74,you're speaking to has a younger brother,1964700.0,1966379.0
74,but you're not sure you want them to,1966380.0,1968479.0
74,confirm it you could say something like,1968480.0,1970219.0
74,you have a younger brother to which they,1970220.0,1972079.0
74,could reply yes I do or no I don't,1972080.0,1973879.0
74,because in context you know that they,1973880.0,1976398.0
74,are a higher authority whether or not,1976399.0,1977719.0
74,they have a younger brother than you are,1977720.0,1979038.0
74,probably yeah the you have pets would,1979039.0,1982639.0
74,obviously come across as a question,1982640.0,1983959.0
74,because I know who's in my household,1983960.0,1986359.0
74,more than you do right so if I talk,1986360.0,1988819.0
74,about somebody's internal States you,1988820.0,1990979.0
74,know you're hungry that actually means,1990980.0,1992839.0
74,are you hungry because how could I know,1992840.0,1994518.0
74,whether you're hungry or not except if,1994519.0,1996079.0
74,you tell me it reminds me a little bit,1996080.0,1997999.0
74,of how questions get asked that use,1998000.0,2000579.0
74,evidentials in lamjung yilmo and the,2000580.0,2003518.0
74,other languages I've worked with which,2003519.0,2005379.0
74,is that you have to ask a question of,2005380.0,2007359.0
74,someone and they have to answer with,2007360.0,2009639.0
74,whether they know because they saw,2009640.0,2011319.0
74,something or because they heard about it,2011320.0,2012999.0
74,and you ask the question by using the,2013000.0,2015879.0
74,form of evidence you think they're most,2015880.0,2017499.0
74,likely to have okay based on their,2017500.0,2020678.0
74,experience so you have to keep track of,2020679.0,2022538.0
74,whether this person has the likelihood,2022539.0,2024879.0
74,of answering a question and what,2024880.0,2026558.0
74,evidence they're going to use to answer,2026559.0,2027999.0
74,the question with so this is something,2028000.0,2030158.0
74,like if you're saying do you know if,2030159.0,2033219.0
74,someone's still around or do you think,2033220.0,2035139.0
74,they're still around or have you seen,2035140.0,2036398.0
74,this person recently like whether,2036399.0,2038018.0
74,they're likely to know whether they're,2038019.0,2039579.0
74,likely to know because they saw the,2039580.0,2041079.0
74,person or heard or a really good example,2041080.0,2042819.0
74,is the difference between are you hungry,2042820.0,2045038.0
74,or is she hungry where if I ask you if,2045039.0,2048398.0
74,you're hungry I'm going to use do you,2048399.0,2050378.0
74,have personal experience of The Hunger,2050379.0,2052118.0
74,whereas if I ask about someone else is,2052119.0,2054398.0
74,this other person hungry have you been,2054399.0,2056259.0
74,told right because I wouldn't be able to,2056260.0,2058719.0
74,experience that directly yeah this,2058720.0,2060878.0
74,sounds like it might be sort of useful,2060879.0,2062079.0
74,in talking especially about people in,2062080.0,2063939.0
74,social situations so I want to say like,2063940.0,2065979.0
74,did they have a nice party there's a,2065980.0,2068199.0
74,difference between whether you think I,2068200.0,2069638.0
74,was there at the party having direct,2069639.0,2071019.0
74,experience of it being nice or whether I,2071020.0,2073059.0
74,simply heard about it after it happened,2073060.0,2074259.0
74,and I think it went really well yeah and,2074260.0,2077138.0
74,it's not that we aren't aware of this in,2077139.0,2079358.0
74,English as well it's just that we're,2079359.0,2081098.0
74,forced to make a grammatical choice in,2081099.0,2083979.0
74,these languages with evidential systems,2083980.0,2086079.0
74,that shows up this information asymmetry,2086080.0,2089439.0
74,or access to information in a different,2089440.0,2091178.0
74,way whereas in English doing so is,2091179.0,2093279.0
74,optional like you can do it but you,2093280.0,2095138.0
74,don't have to yeah and if I ask do they,2095139.0,2097479.0
74,have a nice party and you say oh I,2097480.0,2099338.0
74,didn't go but someone else said it was,2099339.0,2100899.0
74,great I'd be like oh okay I might have,2100900.0,2103239.0
74,asked because I thought you'd been there,2103240.0,2104618.0
74,right so it's sort of yeah embeds sort,2104619.0,2106779.0
74,of what your assumptions are I found the,2106780.0,2109179.0
74,way that people do questions in,2109180.0,2110979.0
74,conversations so interesting that I,2110980.0,2113439.0

76,tricked me up when I started working in Nepal is that we have 'Nepali Bhasa' and 'Nepal Bhasa.',627360.0,634019.0

76,"L: Yeah, we're definitely collecting words for 'language' in this episode",701580.0,705179.0
76,as much as we're collecting language names. It comes part and parcel with the territory.,705180.0,709799.0

76,but it's also spread to other parts of Australia as well. That's the first creole,756480.0,761159.0
76,that comes to mind for me. What about for you? G: I think the first creole language that I think,761160.0,764999.0
76,"of is Haitian Creole, which is also often referred to just as 'Kreyòl,' but in this",765000.0,769559.0
76,case spelled K-R-E-Y-O-L with an accent on the O. This is the language of Haiti which is descended,769560.0,777479.0
76,from French. It's also spoken in the context of displacement and colonisation and having a,777480.0,783359.0
76,"bunch of people losing some connections with their linguistic roots, but they don't have",783360.0,787259.0

76,have this common history of being this contact language in terms of what 'creole' refers to.,791220.0,795839.0
76,L: I find it so fascinating that this word 'creole' has this long history and in certain,795840.0,801359.0
76,places has become attached to particular languages that arise in these situations. And in other,801360.0,806159.0
76,places it refers to maybe the people or the food from the area. 'Creole' pops up in a lot of places,806160.0,813239.0
76,where you've seen French or English colonisation. G: There're also creoles that are extended,813240.0,817859.0

76,"has two names, you said, Metis or Michif. G: Yeah. The name of this people and this",943500.0,948179.0

76,but what's important is respecting the wishes of the community that has that particular language.,1002240.0,1006379.0
76,One of the things that I've been following is names of Bantu languages because a lot,1006380.0,1011539.0
76,of them seem to come in pairs. Sometimes you see 'Swahili' in a list. Sometimes you,1011540.0,1015919.0
76,see 'Kiswahili.' Sometimes you see 'Zulu.' Sometimes you see 'Isizulu.' Sometimes you,1015920.0,1018799.0
76,"see 'Sotho' and 'Sesotho' or 'Tswana' and 'Setswana.,' 'Congo' and 'Kikongo.' A lot",1018800.0,1027379.0
76,of these language names seem to come in pairs like that where one of them has this prefix,1027380.0,1031099.0
76,"that's something like /ki-/ or /si-/ or /t͡ʃi-/. L: I know that Setswana is spoken in Botswana,",1031100.0,1036679.0
76,and Sesotho is spoken in Lesotho. They're all connected somehow. This marking of something is,1036680.0,1044179.0
76,a language by the use of a prefix is something that happens across these languages. They're,1044180.0,1049459.0
76,all part of the Bantu language family. G: Right. And Bantu languages are known for,1049460.0,1053239.0
76,having prefixes that mark lots of things. I dunno if it's settled whether in English people are,1053240.0,1058339.0
76,more likely to use the language prefix to refer to the language or not. It seems to sometimes,1058340.0,1063919.0
76,"vary per language. I mostly see people talking about 'Kinyarwanda,' the language of Rwanda,",1063920.0,1069379.0
76,"which includes the prefix, but I also often hear people talking about 'Zulu' rather than 'Isizulu'",1069380.0,1074959.0
76,"without the prefix. I don't know if there's a consensus across different groups here,",1074960.0,1078559.0
76,or if it's something that varies more locally. L: I guess that just kind of works how an,1078560.0,1083119.0
76,'-ish' or and '-ese' suffix works in English. We have '-ish' suffixes,1083120.0,1087559.0
76,"like 'English' and 'Danish' and 'Irish.' G: Yeah, or '-ese' suffixes like 'Japanese,'",1087560.0,1092359.0
76,"'Cantonese,' 'Portuguese.' These can also get applied to novel contexts to refer to the",1092360.0,1098059.0
76,"concept of a language in general -- something like 'Simlish,' the language of the Sims.",1098060.0,1101599.0
76,"L: Oh, yeah. Or 'Legalese.' G: Or 'Journalese.'",1101600.0,1105799.0
76,"L: I guess there is an older tendency to refer to 'Nepali' as 'Nepalese' as a language. Now,",1105800.0,1112339.0
76,"you are more likely to see it written as 'Nepali,' so taking their preference for the name as it's",1112340.0,1117499.0
76,pronounced closer to their own use of the name rather than this English suffixised form.,1117500.0,1123139.0
76,G: Sometimes the move closer towards how a community identifies themself happens,1123140.0,1128299.0
76,at the morphological level where the suffix or the prefix changes as well.,1128300.0,1131359.0
76,L: This distinction between what a group of people refer to their own language as,1131360.0,1135679.0
76,and how a language is referred to by people outside of the group is often quite different,1135680.0,1141079.0
76,as we've discussed with a few examples so far. G: I think the first example that I learned of,1141080.0,1145459.0
76,names for languages being really different in the language versus from other people who speak the,1145460.0,1150919.0
76,"language was in German, which in French, which I was learning very early, is 'Allemand.' and",1150920.0,1155179.0
76,"then in German itself, is 'Deutsch.' All three of these were really different from each other.",1155180.0,1159019.0
76,"L: In Italian it's 'Tedesco,' and in Polish it's 'Niemiecki.' These are all very different.",1159020.0,1165256.0
76,"G: These are all very different. Something like 'English' to 'Anglais' in French, I was like,",1165257.0,1170779.0
76,"yeah, I sort of see how that happens. You hold it loosely and see how it's similar. But 'German'",1170780.0,1175159.0
76,to 'Deutsch' to Allemand' to -- L: 'Niemiecki' to 'Tedesco.',1175160.0,1179539.0
76,G: These all sound really different to each other.,1179540.0,1181819.0
76,L: Part of this is that Germany as a country and German as a unified language is a relatively,1181820.0,1187279.0
76,"recent construction in Western and European history, so each of these groups were using",1187280.0,1194419.0
76,names for whatever the German closest to them was and have kept those names as Germany unified.,1194420.0,1199879.0
76,G: Right. There's different Germanic tribes or Germanic peoples that were referred to by,1199880.0,1205759.0
76,different names in different areas. The broader name for this phenomenon of the name of a language,1205760.0,1213679.0
76,"inside its own group and outside of its own group is a contrast between the 'endonym,' the name",1213680.0,1219319.0
76,"inside, and the 'exonym,' the name from outside. L: The '-nym' part there being 'name' and 'endo-'",1219320.0,1226039.0
76,and 'exo-' being a contrasting pair. G: Right. That's '-nym' as in 'pseudonym',1226040.0,1230419.0
76,or 'synonym.' L: 'Antonym.',1230420.0,1232879.0
76,G: 'Endonym' and 'exonym',1232880.0,1233959.0
76,being themselves antonyms. L: Indeed. 'Endo-' and 'exo-',1233960.0,1237619.0
76,pop up in a whole variety of other places as well. We have 'exoplanets',1237620.0,1242299.0
76,which are planets outside of our solar system. G: Does this mean that planets inside our solar,1242300.0,1247099.0
76,"system are technically 'endoplanets'? L: Hmm, maybe technically, yeah,",1247100.0,1251359.0
76,just like we have 'exoskeletons' like lobsters or Super Mecha Warriors.,1251360.0,1255139.0
76,"G: Wait, so we could also have 'endoskeletons,' which is what humans have which is a skeleton",1255140.0,1259759.0
76,"inside our body? L: Yeah, I'm gonna",1259760.0,1261559.0
76,start referring to it as my 'endoskeleton' now. G: I think it's funny because 'endo-' and 'exo-',1261560.0,1266179.0
76,are so clearly opposites. But 'endo-' is familiar to me less from 'endoplanets' and more from words,1266180.0,1272359.0
76,"like 'endocrine system,' which is your hormones. L: Ah, I guess that is that 'endo-'.",1272360.0,1276919.0
76,G: I looked up whether there is also an 'exocrine system.',1276920.0,1280639.0
76,L: Is there? G: Yeah. The endocrine system are the stuff that,1280640.0,1284839.0
76,gets secreted inside your body and the exocrine system is all the stuff that you secrete outside,1284840.0,1291019.0
76,"your body, like sweat and saliva and mucus. L: I guess also in medicine we have",1291020.0,1297139.0
76,"'endoscopes,' which is when you use a camera in an orifice of your body",1297140.0,1301879.0
76,to look at some internal part of your body. G: This is like when you'd put a camera down,1301880.0,1306859.0
76,your throat to look at your vocal cords. L: Yeah. I guess an 'exoscope' is just any,1306860.0,1311239.0
76,normal camera you take a selfie with because it's looking at the outside of your body.,1311240.0,1315139.0
76,G: Great. I'm gonna refer to my normal camera as an 'exoscope' now.,1315140.0,1319819.0
76,"L: An 'endonym' is the name that we have in our own language for our language,",1319820.0,1325219.0
76,and an 'exonym' is the name that we have for a language of some other group of people.,1325220.0,1330919.0
76,"G: To go back to the German example, 'Deutsch' is the endonym, and then 'Tedesco' and 'Allemand'",1330920.0,1337999.0
76,and 'German' and 'Niemiecki' are all exonyms for 'German' coming from the,1338000.0,1344659.0
76,perspective of various other languages. L: We've seen some recurring motifs already,1344660.0,1349099.0
76,"in terms of endonyms, people using words like 'talk' or 'language' or 'people' for reference",1349100.0,1354499.0
76,"to their own language, but there're also lots of different types of exonyms as well.",1354500.0,1359539.0
76,"G: Sometimes, when a community wants to change the name of their language,",1359540.0,1363259.0
76,that sometimes means replacing certain exonyms that other communities are using for their,1363260.0,1368299.0
76,"language with something that's closer to the endonym of how they're referring to themselves,",1368300.0,1372139.0
76,which is especially important if this particular community hasn't had a lot of self-determination,1372140.0,1376939.0
76,"in the first place. I don't think I know any Germans who are like, 'Yeah, no, English speakers",1376940.0,1380359.0
76,"need to refer to us as 'Deutsch',' but that's a reflection of German social status, which",1380360.0,1384439.0
76,is not the same if you're from a language where there's been this long history of colonisation.,1384440.0,1389239.0
76,L: One type of exonym that can sometimes be easy to spot in the wild is when the name,1389240.0,1394639.0
76,"for the language as an exonym is very similar to their own endonym. For example, we call Italian,",1394640.0,1401359.0
76,"'Italian,' and in Italian it is 'Italiano.' G: Right, which is really similar. Sometimes,",1401360.0,1407179.0
76,it's just the languages don't have quite the same sounds. The vowels in Italian,1407180.0,1411019.0
76,"are gonna be different from the vowels in English, and so 'Italian' versus 'Italiano'",1411020.0,1414739.0
76,is produced with slightly different vowels even though the spelling is quite similar.,1414740.0,1417619.0
76,L: These are cognate because it's the same word just pronounced in each of,1417620.0,1421759.0
76,"the respective languages. Sometimes, these cognates can be a little bit more hidden.",1421760.0,1426319.0
76,"G: Yeah. Like, 'Tedesco' in Italian is actually from the same origin as the German word 'Deutsch.'",1426320.0,1432559.0
76,"It also gives us the English 'Teutonic.' L: Ah, right.",1432560.0,1435199.0
76,G: It's just that those words ended up with diverging trajectories in those languages.,1435200.0,1439519.0
76,One place where you have a lot of adaptation for pronunciation differences is if the languages have,1439520.0,1445519.0
76,"different modalities. If you have a sign language, and you wanna refer to it in a spoken language,",1445520.0,1450499.0
76,"you need a spoken name to refer to it and vice versa, you need a signed",1450500.0,1454039.0
76,name to refer to a spoken language. L: I think this is why a lot of signed,1454040.0,1457939.0
76,"languages end up having acronym-type names, so 'American Sign Language,' 'ASL,' 'British",1457940.0,1463639.0
76,"Sign Language,' 'BSL,' because there isn't a direct way to take the cognate from the",1463640.0,1468199.0
76,"signed language into the spoken language. G: Actually, that raises a question for me",1468200.0,1472459.0
76,"which is 'Auslan' which has, I think, a relatively straightforward etymology,",1472460.0,1476779.0
76,"'Australia' and 'language,' but it doesn't have that acronymic thing. I guess it would just be",1476780.0,1482719.0
76,'ASL' for 'Australian Sign Language' which would be confusing. Do you know how that came about?,1482720.0,1486319.0
76,"L: In the 1970s and '80s when Trevor Johnston started working on Auslan, it already had a",1486320.0,1492739.0
76,name in Auslan. It has its own sign. But Trevor Johnston needed a way to refer to it in English,1492740.0,1498439.0
76,"as well. He actually took inspiration from what was happening in America at the time,",1498440.0,1504019.0
76,which is that what we now know as ASL was also being quite commonly referred to as,1504020.0,1509299.0
76,"'Ameslan' -- so a blend instead of an acronym. G: Of like, 'American Sign Language' -- oh,",1509300.0,1517579.0
76,the S there is for 'sign.' 'Ameslan.' Okay. L: Yeah.,1517580.0,1520759.0
76,"G: So, the S in 'Auslan' is also for 'sign' rather than 'Aus' as in 'Australia.",1520760.0,1525979.0
76,L: It's a bit of both. And I think that's why it's really stood the test of time because it really,1525980.0,1530899.0
76,"has a very word feel. As you said, it also would have to compete with 'ASL' for recognition in that",1530900.0,1538339.0
76,three-letter acronym approach. 'Auslan' has stood the test of time in a way that 'Ameslan' hasn't.,1538340.0,1544639.0
76,G: That's interesting. I think that when I think of other linguistic varieties that have acronymic,1544640.0,1550099.0
76,"names, I think of accents and dialects and varieties that've been named in the last,",1550100.0,1553459.0
76,"maybe, century or so. L: Acronym-ing is a",1553460.0,1556519.0
76,"very 20th Century approach, for sure. G: 20th and 21st, I guess. Things like",1556520.0,1561619.0
76,"'MLE,' 'Multicultural London English,' or 'RP,' 'Received Pronunciation,' or 'AAVE,' 'AAE,' 'AAL,'",1561620.0,1569539.0
76,"which is 'African American Vernacular English,' 'African American English,' 'African American",1569540.0,1573139.0
76,"Language,' depending on how you wanna name it -- these are all very acronymic names for things that",1573140.0,1578359.0
76,"have been named comparatively recently, whereas some of the older English varieties, I'm thinking",1578360.0,1582859.0
76,"things like 'Cockney,' which is associated with the working class in London's East End,",1582860.0,1587119.0
76,"or like 'Scouse' in Liverpool, these have names that aren't acronymic. These are varieties that",1587120.0,1593839.0
76,have been named for a longer period of time. L: It's interesting how the way that we talk,1593840.0,1597799.0
76,about different languages and different varieties reflects,1597800.0,1600319.0
76,larger trends in approaches to naming things. G: Another way that language names can come about,1600320.0,1606799.0
76,is by doing a more direct or a partial translation of the name for the language in the language. An,1606800.0,1612499.0
76,"example of this is 'Light Walpiri,' which is a mixed language of Australia that has Indigenous",1612500.0,1618319.0
76,"Walpiri language, Kriol, and Standard Australian English as its parent languages. The name 'Light",1618320.0,1624619.0
76,"Walpiri,' which I'd encountered in a few contexts because it made some news when the linguist named",1624620.0,1629659.0
76,"Carmel O'Shannessy was documenting it initially, I was interested to read in one of the papers that",1629660.0,1634099.0
76,"the name comes from 'Walpiri rampaku,' which literally means in Walpiri 'light Walpiri.'",1634100.0,1641299.0
76,She as a linguist decided to translate part of the name into English while,1641300.0,1645979.0
76,keeping the connection with how people were referring to it in the language -- or possibly,1645980.0,1649819.0
76,"speakers were doing that, but it has this connection to how people were talking about",1649820.0,1652579.0
76,"it without being a direct reflection of it. L: So, that exonym that is the way that I know the",1652580.0,1657799.0
76,language is a direct translation of their endonym for it within Walpiri. Interesting. I never knew,1657800.0,1665059.0
76,the history of 'Light Walpiri.' G: I was wondering why,1665060.0,1667519.0
76,"'light,' and that seems to be why. L: Sometimes, the exonym that we use in one",1667520.0,1671659.0
76,"language was borrowed as the exonym from another language. So, we didn't borrow someone's endonym",1671660.0,1677599.0
76,"or own way of talking about their language, we borrowed it from, maybe, their neighbours.",1677600.0,1682219.0
76,G: This is really common in the North American Indigenous context. There are loads and loads,1682220.0,1687379.0
76,"of examples. One of them is the name 'Navajo,' which comes from a Tewa word, which is another",1687380.0,1693319.0
76,"Indigenous language spoken nearby, 'navahu,' which combines the word 'nava,' meaning field,",1693320.0,1698659.0
76,"and 'hu,' meaning 'valley,' to mean 'large field.' It was borrowed from Tewa into Spanish",1698660.0,1703399.0
76,"to refer to a particular place, and then later into English for the people and their language.",1703400.0,1708619.0
76,"But the name that the people themselves use is Diné, which also means 'people,' with the",1708620.0,1714439.0
76,"language known as 'Diné bizaad' or 'people's language,' or sometimes 'Naabeehó bizaad,' but",1714440.0,1720079.0
76,'Naabeehó' is this adaptation of the word 'Navajo' because there's not actually any V in Diné.,1720080.0,1726559.0
76,L: Always a bit of giveaway when the exonym has sounds in it that don't,1726560.0,1730999.0
76,"exist in the language it's referring to. G: Really big one. In this case, 'field'",1731000.0,1736219.0
76,"and 'valley,' that's got a relatively neutral valence. It's not the name in their own language,",1736220.0,1741259.0
76,but it's not a particularly bad thing to be people in a field or a valley. But a lot of these names,1741260.0,1746719.0
76,"from neighbours are sometimes pretty pejorative. L: That is definitely a large theme in exonyms,",1746720.0,1754219.0
76,especially when it's not the group itself that got to determine how they were referred to by,1754220.0,1758299.0
76,outsiders. It's part of why Kagate speakers moved to calling themselves,1758300.0,1762979.0
76,"'Syuba' even though both of those names refer to their previous occupation as paper-makers,",1762980.0,1768739.0
76,which was seen as not a very aspirational career in the social hierarchy of Nepal. They've taken,1768740.0,1774799.0
76,a lot more pride in their own word for that name rather than for the Nepali word which,1774800.0,1779299.0
76,has more immediate negative connotations for Nepali speakers. It took me a long time to,1779300.0,1784399.0
76,make the connection between the Slavic language family and the word that we have from originally,1784400.0,1790459.0
76,Greek and then Latin into modern languages as 'slave.' These two words are actually,1790460.0,1796339.0
76,cognate with each other. G: Oh boy. Okay. Is there,1796340.0,1799279.0
76,a sense of which one arouse first? L: I felt like I got conflicting and,1799280.0,1804079.0
76,slightly-confusing-and-lost-to-history stories depending on the etymological,1804080.0,1807979.0

76,"about the social status of speakers of those languages within, definitely, the Roman Empire.",1812900.0,1817579.0
76,G: That's for sure a thing. This is also really common when it comes to Indigenous languages that,1817580.0,1823939.0
76,a lot of their names are pejoratives. I'm not necessarily sure that I wanna repeat a,1823940.0,1827299.0
76,whole bunch of pejoratives of what the names are. People are trying to bury them. I think,1827300.0,1831739.0
76,my go-to example that's comparatively a relatively mild pejorative is the name,1831740.0,1835759.0
76,"'Maliseet,' which is a language spoken around Eastern Canada and North-Eastern United States,",1835760.0,1841939.0
76,"also sometimes called 'Passamaquoddy.' I grew up with that just being the name for the language,",1841940.0,1847039.0
76,"but then I learned later that this actually comes from a name by the Mi'kmaq people, who are another",1847040.0,1852379.0
76,Indigenous group that's slightly further east in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick and Prince Edward,1852380.0,1857479.0
76,"Island and around there, who were encountered by Europeans slightly earlier. They were asked,",1857480.0,1863539.0

77,F: The number one thing is coordinating the different studies that go on. We have studies,607680.0,613439.0
77,that are carried out independently by our PhD students. We also have studies that we run as,613440.0,618899.0
77,"a group amongst all of our research assistants and our student assistants, and then just making sure",618900.0,624539.0
77,that everything is running on schedule. I also do a lot of prep before any study's been conducted.,624540.0,630419.0
77,We write all of our surveys. We make sure that all of the equipment is well set up. Then there is,630420.0,636599.0
77,"also the administrative side of things, which is the boring and less-glamorous part of research.",636600.0,642659.0
77,G: This is working on writing grants or filling out paperwork to get permission,642660.0,647639.0
77,"to work with children. You have to go through the ethics board and tell them,",647640.0,651659.0
77,"'No, we're not gonna harm the children. It's gonna be fine. They're just gonna look at some pictures",651660.0,654539.0
77,"and hear some sounds or something.' If you've got equipment -- like you've got an EEG machine,",654540.0,660119.0
77,"which is the electrode cap that you put on your head, and you can see the brain waves going. I",660120.0,665339.0
77,guess that probably needs to be maintained. F: We need to watch that very thoroughly. We,665340.0,669779.0
77,need to train our students when they come into the lab on how to use it. We have interns come,669780.0,674579.0
77,"in every summer, and they do good work with us. I also manage all of our interns and, I think,",674580.0,679859.0
77,"help our students or our undergrads see what's the reality behind doing research. I think,",679860.0,686939.0
77,"very often, they might think about grad school, or they might think about moving into the field of",686940.0,692399.0
77,"academia after graduation, just seeing the glam side of things, or looking at papers that are",692400.0,699059.0
77,"being published, or books that are being written. G: And papers look very polished, right. Like,",699060.0,702959.0
77,"'Oh, we did this thing. We had 32 infants. They came in and did this.' It doesn't tell you like,",702960.0,707039.0
77,"'This infant started crying, and so we had to exclude them,' or like, 'These infants -- we tried",707040.0,712499.0
77,"to call their parents, and they wouldn't reply to our messages, and so they wouldn't come in.",712500.0,716279.0
77,"We actually tried to get 52, but only 32 came.' F: Yes, the day-to-day of it is very mundane.",716280.0,723479.0
77,A lot of the work that we are focusing now on is understanding the linguistic landscape for,723480.0,729779.0
77,"children growing up in Singapore, so we wanna find out what's going on at home:",729780.0,733559.0
77,"Who is talking to them, and in what languages, and in what proportion? The best way to do that right",733560.0,739259.0
77,now is to send them home with a little recorder. G: I've seen this recorder. It's sort of the,739260.0,743639.0
77,"size of a credit card but thicker. You put it in a shirt that the child wears,",743640.0,748139.0
77,"and it has a little Velcro pocket, so it doesn't fall it. Then it runs, and the kid can run around,",748140.0,752759.0
77,"and you're not trying to keep them in front of a mic where they have to stay still,",752760.0,756659.0
77,"which because they're toddlers, they're not gonna do that. You can hear anything that the infant",756660.0,761339.0
77,"says and also anything that someone says, like an adult or an older child, says around them.",761340.0,764759.0
77,F: That's right. That recorder goes on for about 10-16 hours on its own. When we get that recording,764760.0,771779.0
77,"back, the humans have to go listen to these recordings. We do a lot of transcription work.",771780.0,777239.0
77,"That is one of the day-to-day mundane things. It's not exciting. You sit in front of a computer,",777240.0,782519.0
77,"and you open up a file, and you're listening, maybe, for an hour before you have to stop because",782520.0,788039.0
77,it's just too much. We do a lot of fine-grained transcription. We're not only noting down the,788040.0,796439.0
77,"words that are being said, we are also looking at who's saying it; we're counting the number",796440.0,800579.0
77,"of turns; we're making it for the different languages. Right now, I'm speaking English,",800580.0,806159.0
77,but the day-to-day conversation for a Singaporean household might be English plus a lot of other,806160.0,813239.0
77,things that are going on. Maybe it's different from what we conventionally understand as,813240.0,818699.0
77,code-switching or the way that code-switching is being described in textbooks is that you,818700.0,824939.0
77,"switch very elegantly from one language to the other in a nice, wrapped up sentence.",824940.0,831899.0
77,"G: Right. So, it's saying like, okay, I'm gonna say this bit in, for me, English,",831900.0,836159.0
77,"and then French or something, and I'm going back and forth. This implies that these two languages",836160.0,841559.0
77,are distinct entities that I'm switching back and forth between them. But if you've grown,841560.0,845639.0
77,"up in a multilingual household your whole life, and your parents have also grown up",845640.0,849419.0
77,"in a multilingual household, what you're also doing is producing the whole spectrum in a way",849420.0,855059.0
77,that's like how people have produced it around you but also may be a little bit different.,855060.0,858359.0
77,"F: It's not 'clean' code switching. It happens within an utterance. People swap out words,",858360.0,866759.0
77,"and sometimes it's conscious, sometimes it's unconscious, sometimes it's deliberate to make",866760.0,871499.0
77,"a point. The way that we describe it, or I like to think about it, is if you have a salad bowl of",871500.0,881339.0
77,different components -- you have your tomatoes; you have your cucumber and onions -- as I'm speaking,881340.0,888839.0
77,"to a different person, I can decide which part of the salad I wanna pick, which ingredient I",888840.0,894479.0
77,"wanna pick. It's not a clean switch. For me, it would be English and Mandarin. It's not a clean",894480.0,900059.0
77,"switch between the two. Then, of course, there's this very exciting thing called 'Singlish.'",900060.0,904319.0
77,"G: This is stuff that's unique to Singapore. 'Singlish' seems to imply that it's English-y,",904320.0,910439.0
77,"but there's stuff from lots of languages involved. F: When I was in university, and when we first",910440.0,917279.0
77,"looked at it from a very academic setting, it's often described as a 'creoloid.' It's a little",917280.0,925979.0
77,"bit like a creole but maybe not. Then people have explained to it say that, oh, the backbone",925980.0,932819.0
77,"of Singlish is English, and then it's added with all these vocabulary from non-English languages.",932820.0,938759.0
77,G: This is gonna be like Chinese but less Mandarin.,938760.0,941939.0
77,"F: Less Mandarin, for sure. More Hokkien. In some other parts of the world,",941940.0,948359.0
77,"'Hokkien' is also referred to as 'Min Nan.' Then some Cantonese, some Teochew, Hakka,",948360.0,955739.0

77,"and Hakka are all Chinese varieties within that, and then Malay and Tamil are separate",960840.0,966239.0

77,"F: We were colonised by the British for a long time. Before that time,",970380.0,976919.0
77,"we didn't really have people living on the island. Well, historically, if you look at it, there were",976920.0,984419.0

77,"and they decide to develop this place, or this island, as a port, obviously, lots of people",992880.0,997799.0
77,"came for work opportunities. We saw a lot of migration from modern-day south part of China,",997800.0,1006199.0
77,so the Guangzhou/Guangdong region. We also saw some migration from modern-day Malaysia,1006200.0,1011779.0
77,and Indonesia and then from the southern part of India. That's why the Indian language that's,1011780.0,1017359.0
77,"spoken here, predominantly, by people at that time was Tamil instead of Hindi, for example.",1017360.0,1022279.0

77,"trying to say, 'Here are the results that we have. This is what kids are getting exposed to'?",1053660.0,1058219.0
77,F: I think the thing that we didn't expect was to do so much language documentation as part of this,1058220.0,1065719.0
77,"project. Because what we wanna do is find out, you know, what are kids growing up hearing. But then,",1065720.0,1070819.0
77,"along the way, because we were collecting all of this data, we are also documenting what is",1070820.0,1075439.0
77,the current state of things for what Singlish sounds like or what we can say what Singlish,1075440.0,1081859.0
77,"is in a household right now. If we look at the Singapore census, the last one was taken in 2020,",1081860.0,1089419.0
77,a huge number of the younger population now say that English is the predominant home language. It,1089420.0,1096199.0
77,has crossed the 50% threshold for the younger age groups. That's a first in our country's,1096200.0,1102259.0
77,history. You can also imagine that the English here or the Singlish here is changing rapidly,1102260.0,1109279.0
77,compared to my parents' or my grandparents' era. G: What people are doing is changing. If you say,1109280.0,1115399.0
77,"English is a dominant home language, that's picking one out of probably",1115400.0,1119839.0
77,there are still several languages being spoken in this mixed way.,1119840.0,1123499.0
77,"F: Understanding what Singlish is is one thing, and then when we are writing it in our paper,",1123500.0,1130639.0
77,how do we make ourselves well understood for an audience that is unfamiliar with research in a,1130640.0,1136939.0
77,non-standard variety. One of the things that we tried explaining is this term that we use called,1136940.0,1142939.0
77,'red-dot.' We have a current study going on called 'Red-dot Baby-talk' where we have a list of words,1142940.0,1149839.0
77,"that we come up with based on what we know Singaporean parents use with their children,",1149840.0,1153499.0

77,and 'Would you use this word with a child?' G: Just to back up for second. 'Red-dot' is a,1158960.0,1164299.0
77,"term for Singapore, right, because if you look at a big map of the world, it's a city state,",1164300.0,1171259.0
77,"effectively, it's about the size of a red dot on a map. So, this is an affectionate",1171260.0,1176479.0
77,"way of referring to Singapore-specific words. F: Mm-hmm, yeah. One of the words would be",1176480.0,1181579.0

77,'a shower' or something? F: Yeah! That's right. We,1194660.0,1197719.0
77,don't know -- at least I have no idea -- where that word came from. My guess is it's from one,1197720.0,1204559.0
77,"of these Chinese varieties that we talked about just now, but I'm not 100% certain.",1204560.0,1209059.0
77,G: Right. Because it doesn't have a clear etymology linked to any,1209060.0,1212239.0
77,particular language. It's just this is a word people use in Singapore with kids.,1212240.0,1216079.0

77,"F: Then we also have the word ' sayang.' ' sayang' is -- well, originated from Malay,",1232100.0,1241579.0
77,"but the use of it in Malay, it's very different from the use of it in Singlish. In Malay,",1241580.0,1246619.0
77,"it can be used as a verb to mean, like, 'love.' It can also be used as a term",1246620.0,1251659.0
77,"of affection. You can call someone your ' sayang,' your 'darling.' But in Singlish,",1251660.0,1256699.0

77,fair bit is 'lah' because it seems to be pretty common. It's like a confirmation or question.,1369800.0,1375559.0
77,F: Confirmation. It's also sometimes used to make something sound final and,1375560.0,1381859.0

78,My first question is 'How did you get into linguistics?',137540.0,143989.0
78,H: Wow!,143990.0,145529.0
78,A big question.,145530.0,146719.0
78,I think that I began my journey into linguistics when I was at school.,146720.0,152559.0
78,"Originally, I was very enthusiastic about plants.",152560.0,156791.0
78,"Things like biology, the life system, how things grow, and how we're all connected.",156792.0,164412.0
78,I thought I might become a nurse.,164413.0,167860.0
78,"So, I registered in a course, and then I pulled out because there wasn't any role models.",167861.0,173029.0
78,Deaf nurses were not there.,173030.0,175322.0
78,I felt that I couldn't do that and dropped it.,175323.0,180094.0
78,"In a few years, I went to work, realised as a deaf person seeing a world very differently,",180095.0,188329.0
78,"it was very different from being in school, being in the big wide world,",188330.0,191620.0
78,and communication was very difficult.,191621.0,193674.0
78,There were many barriers.,193675.0,195698.0
78,"I started to get interested in language, communication, speech, and sign.",195699.0,204310.0
78,"I started to think, 'Okay, I want to go into a university course and look at linguistics.'",204311.0,210703.0
78,"Auslan being my language, I wanted to bring those two together.",210704.0,215032.0
78,I enrolled here at La Trobe University way back.,215033.0,219999.0
78,G: Did you start enrolling in linguistics courses right away,220000.0,223671.0
78,or do some other things as well?,223672.0,226500.0
78,"H: No, I went straight to linguistics -- the whole gamut -- seriously.",226501.0,231860.0
78,G: What parts of linguistics were you excited about?,231861.0,236408.0
78,"H: Originally, I was interested in speech and phonetics.",236409.0,241880.0
78,"And like I said before, it was really speech, for me, that was quite puzzling.",241881.0,250253.0

78,"When I went into this course and started studying linguistics,",252724.0,256608.0
78,I had the opportunity to pull it apart -- what speech was like.,256609.0,262709.0
78,So I looked at phonetics.,262710.0,265114.0
78,"I had an amazing teacher here, Professor Marija Tabain.",265115.0,272238.0
78,She was a big supporter.,272239.0,274423.0
78,She brought in another skilled person to teach me one-on-one about speech.,274424.0,281706.0

78,That was under Professor Trevor Johnston.,414010.0,418019.0
78,"At that time, he was at Macquarie University.",418020.0,423369.0
78,He set up the Auslan Corpus.,423370.0,426249.0

78,H: That's right.,434150.0,435349.0
78,I didn't do that.,435350.0,437109.0
78,"He actually created the corpus, did the filming of over 200 people producing signs.",437110.0,442799.0
78,This meant there was already a rich set of resources available for those who were skilled,442800.0,448999.0
78,enough to do research into Auslan and be able to select different elements and recognise,449000.0,455779.0
78,certain things and understand how d/Deaf people actually used sign.,455780.0,462989.0
78,It wasn't like sign linguists in the past.,462990.0,466348.0
78,"A lot of people had thought certain things, but it wasn't the actual researcher saying",466349.0,473408.0
78,a sign was used naturally.,473409.0,475519.0
78,"Trevor Johnston's Auslan Corpus, for the first time, we were able to then analyse signing",475520.0,481123.0
78,as it was produced more naturally.,481124.0,483257.0
78,G: Where was he getting this data?,483258.0,486506.0
78,"Like, bringing people into a lab?",486507.0,489999.0
78,H: The Auslan Corpus was the first sign language corpus.,490000.0,496689.0
78,It was created following traditional language recording and documentation methods and done,496690.0,507299.0
78,in a lab.,507300.0,510059.0
78,There was filming.,510060.0,511400.0
78,There were several cameras sitting in that lab filming people chatting.,511401.0,514939.0
78,G: Sort of like what we're doing right now?,514940.0,518228.0
78,"H: Yeah, pretty similar, yes.",518229.0,520059.0
78,G: But eventually you wanna know what people are talking about when they're not in a,520060.0,527136.0
78,university campus in two chairs.,527137.0,529018.0
78,Did they take it somewhere more natural?,529019.0,532409.0
78,"H: For the Auslan Corpus, no.",532410.0,536989.0
78,What they did was only in the lab.,536990.0,541349.0
78,That influenced other people in the projects that they then began filming in more natural,541350.0,548159.0
78,environments.,548160.0,549159.0
78,G: You were using this corpus for your PhD studies -- analysing what was being depicted,549160.0,554869.0
78,in it?,554870.0,556119.0
78,"H: Yes, yes.",556120.0,557989.0
78,"That corpus had a number of different elements, and different people signing.",557990.0,563589.0
78,There were stories.,563590.0,564919.0
78,There were conversations.,564920.0,566249.0
78,There were also different games -- a whole number of things.,566250.0,571709.0
78,"At that time, when I was studying in 2010, conversations at that time -- you know, analysing",571710.0,580699.0
78,"people in conversation, that hadn't really been looked into for signed languages.",580700.0,583398.0
78,"It was more signed narratives that people looked at because, at the time, we were still",583399.0,588709.0
78,trying to address barriers with applying linguistics theories to signed languages.,588710.0,590699.0
78,"We had problems with how we would research a 3-dimensional language, face-to-face language.",590700.0,597069.0
78,How could we capture the signs?,597070.0,600549.0
78,"When you actually identify the signs, you had to think about what type of signs they",600550.0,608949.0
78,were.,608950.0,609949.0
78,"Were they conventional signs, like where people agree on particular signs and the meaning",609950.0,617009.0
78,"of those signs, which makes them conventional, or were they more unusual and improvised signs,",617010.0,620799.0
78,depending heavily on context to be understood?,620800.0,623381.0
78,That was one of the biggest problems that we had at that time.,623382.0,626409.0
78,I would analyse a narrative and analyse the signs and the signer's body as one whole.,626410.0,634429.0
78,"G: Some parts of that are conventional signs, like here's a word for 'book' or something,",634430.0,639479.0

78,"H: Well, from those narratives that I was looking at, I found a various number of things.",658120.0,664088.0
78,My view at the time was that I was researching clause structure.,664089.0,671199.0
78,"I did things like -- as an example, spoken language has word order.",671200.0,679879.0
78,But with sign language it was different because it's 3-dimensional.,679880.0,684669.0
78,"What was interesting was that, at first, was it the subject that came first or the verb?",684670.0,690619.0
78,I was looking at that.,690620.0,693509.0
78,"Because the research that was being done in sign, narratives have a lot of components.",693510.0,700319.0
78,There's 'role shift' or 'enactment.',700320.0,702588.0

78,You will say or show what that particular entity did with your body.,724339.0,730979.0
78,I looked at how enactment and other less conventional things were incorporated into the clause structure.,730980.0,737559.0
78,"G: I've seen sometimes when people are doing enactment, like, let's say you have a story",737560.0,745948.0

78,We sat and chatted.,778670.0,780179.0

78,"We had 20 people who told one story, and another 20 people telling another story.",806300.0,812939.0
78,Each 20 people had the same story.,812940.0,817039.0
78,"We compared how people would produce the story in sign, then looked at when, why, and how",817040.0,825509.0
78,they incorporated enactment.,825510.0,826699.0
78,G: What were the two narratives that you compared?,826700.0,830249.0
78,H: Okay.,830250.0,831249.0
78,We had one narrative which was The Frog Story.,831250.0,835549.0
78,That was involving 20 people signing The Frog Story.,835550.0,838578.0
78,Lindsay did that work.,838579.0,840319.0
78,Then there was another story called The Boy Who Cried Wolf.,840320.0,846299.0
78,"Again, 20 people relayed that story.",846300.0,849489.0
78,I focused on that.,849490.0,851909.0
78,"The Frog Story was based on an illustrated picture book, and the pictures created the",851910.0,862229.0
78,"story, whereas The Boy Who Cried Wolf followed a written English narrative.",862230.0,866539.0
78,"So, the person had to read the story, think about it, and then reproduce it to another",866540.0,871469.0
78,person.,871470.0,872469.0
78,It was very worthwhile comparing notes with Lindsay because the two of us were able to,872470.0,878458.0
78,"see, from those narratives, similarities and differences in how the stories were conveyed",878459.0,887289.0
78,in Auslan.,887290.0,888289.0
78,G: The Frog Story is a classic story that's used in various areas of linguistics because,888290.0,891088.0
78,"it's this wordless picture book, right, but I think I've seen you have this boy",891089.0,895958.0
78,who's lost a frog and has to find it with a dog and stuff.,895959.0,901518.0
78,And then The Boy Who Cried Wolf is more a folktale that people might've been familiar,901519.0,904989.0
78,with before the study.,904990.0,906949.0
78,"H: Yeah, it was more a moral -- there was a moral to that story.",906950.0,914669.0
78,"So, you know, don't lie, pretty much.",914670.0,919319.0
78,Don't trust a wolf.,919320.0,921409.0
78,Things like that.,921410.0,922569.0
78,G: Don't raise false alarms.,922570.0,924489.0
78,"H: Yes, exactly.",924490.0,925648.0
78,G: Did you find that there were differences in how people told those two stories?,925649.0,934588.0
78,H: Yes.,934589.0,935588.0
78,What we found was huge differences.,935589.0,936588.0
78,The Frog Story -- that was more repetitive in terms of depicting signs.,936589.0,945208.0
78,"For example, it discussed a jar with a lid and various elements, so a tree, beehive -- people",945209.0,959629.0
78,fingerspelled 'beehive' and then showed a depicting sign to represent the beehive.,959630.0,964419.0
78,"Then The Boy Who Cried Wolf -- in that narrative, that followed more English structure.",964420.0,970829.0
78,There was a big influence with English.,970830.0,975529.0
78,There were more words about what people had said and what people did in that retelling.,975530.0,982059.0
78,"So, with The Frog Story, there was no dialogue within it, whereas The Boy Who Cried Wolf",982060.0,989028.0
78,had more dialogue.,989029.0,990169.0
78,It was very interesting to be able to compare both retellings across these signers and look,990170.0,994148.0
78,at how enactment would occur in both stories.,994149.0,997369.0
78,"G: Do you think that's related to the plot of these stories, or the fact that one was",997370.0,1001559.0
78,in pictures and one was in words when they initially encountered it?,1001560.0,1005369.0
78,H: I think that's what we did find.,1005370.0,1007729.0
78,"We looked at it, and we thought, 'What will we do?'",1007730.0,1011758.0
78,We wanted to compare how the event structure proceeded when the signers conveyed these,1011759.0,1018828.0
78,stories.,1018829.0,1019828.0
78,"So, Western stories usually have a beginning, and then one or two events where people start",1019829.0,1030279.0
78,to become a bit fascinated and interested because something's happening within the,1030280.0,1037178.0
78,narrative.,1037179.0,1038178.0
78,Then it becomes the climax of the event and the resolution at the end -- or the summary.,1038179.0,1047619.0
78,Lindsay and I looked at both narratives and how the events occurred throughout the narrative.,1047620.0,1055219.0
78,We looked at when enactment occurred.,1055220.0,1059469.0
78,What we found were very similar things in relation to enactment.,1059470.0,1066428.0
78,"When the story became very active and exciting, people would use more enactment to demonstrate",1066429.0,1072739.0
78,"a lot more of that action, and it became much more alive and interesting.",1072740.0,1082428.0
78,And then the boring parts were less active.,1082429.0,1084759.0
78,G: More of the telling rather than showing at that point.,1084760.0,1087881.0
78,H: Yeah.,1087882.0,1089516.0
78,Basic information and then the enactment would occur in the signing during the more exciting parts.,1089517.0,1095238.0
78,G: What happened after this?,1095239.0,1097499.0
78,Your research in enactment there -- it's led into future projects?,1097500.0,1104009.0
78,"H: Yes, yes.",1104010.0,1106589.0
78,That project was really important for Lindsay and I because we already knew how enactment,1106590.0,1111859.0
78,was very important for sign language.,1111860.0,1114109.0
78,It was not just gesture.,1114110.0,1117859.0
78,"It was not a 'pretend' form of language if you like, an acting out.",1117860.0,1125229.0
78,It was a very integral part -- and very important part -- for sign languages.,1125230.0,1131058.0
78,"We became more interested in looking at it, and we became more interested to research",1131059.0,1136949.0
78,"how enactment would combine with other strategic elements within sign, for example, how you",1136950.0,1146869.0
78,would use more conventional signs with enactment; how you would use depicting signs with enactment.,1146870.0,1155619.0
78,"G: So, conventional signs versus depicting signs?",1155620.0,1158689.0
78,"H: So, conventional signs are those signs, as you mentioned before, things like 'book,'",1158690.0,1170168.0
78,and then depicting signs -- it might be a book and how big the book is.,1170169.0,1179869.0
78,You're showing how big or how small the book is.,1179870.0,1183899.0
78,You would sign the conventional first and then the depicting sign.,1183900.0,1187249.0
78,"If you're using the depicting sign, you would often also see enactment occur at the",1187250.0,1194689.0
78,same time.,1194690.0,1195689.0
78,Not always -- but commonly you would.,1195690.0,1198369.0
78,"G: When you're telling a story or something, you're doing the conventional signs, and",1198370.0,1202668.0
78,then you're -- as you're enacting it or coming up with how it fits into the story,1202669.0,1211008.0
78,or the narrative -- you're doing more depicting to show that?,1211009.0,1216959.0
78,"H: Yes, possibly.",1216960.0,1218819.0
78,G: Did you go onto other types of things other than stories?,1218820.0,1225929.0
78,H: Yeah.,1225930.0,1227219.0
78,Lindsay and I continued the work that we were doing.,1227220.0,1232229.0
78,"Yes, so we became more excited about referencing.",1232230.0,1237079.0
78,This is how people explain who did what to do whom.,1237080.0,1242589.0
78,"It's a very important topic to look at, and it's easy to research that.",1242590.0,1251199.0
78,"Also, with other languages it's easy to research that.",1251200.0,1256769.0
78,"So, our obsession with only enactment went on hold for a little while.",1256770.0,1263469.0
78,"We became a little bit more global , and looked at referencing in narratives.",1263470.0,1268040.0
78,"We went back to those narratives, and every time referencing occurred, such as when somebody",1268041.0,1274245.0
78,"mentioned 'the boy' or 'the dog' or 'the wolf' or 'the village people,'",1274246.0,1280579.0
78,we noted down what had happened -- if it was mentioned first or mentioned later.,1280580.0,1287136.0
78,Then we looked at how a person would deliver that reference.,1287137.0,1293017.0
78,"G: If the boy is more central to the story, then maybe 'the boy' is being said a lot",1293018.0,1299109.0
78,"or being said first, or conversely maybe doesn't need to be said very much at all because we",1299110.0,1302692.0
78,know the whole story's about the boy.,1302693.0,1305002.0
78,H: Yes.,1305003.0,1306522.0
78,"What we commonly found was the first time somebody was mentioned, like 'the boy,'",1306523.0,1312269.0
78,you would use the conventional sign 'boy' and possibly point to where the boy is situated,1312270.0,1319999.0
78,"in the sign space, and then point to the boy.",1320000.0,1323819.0
78,"And then if you're talking about the boy again throughout the story, then you would",1323820.0,1329329.0
78,just enact the boy.,1329330.0,1330939.0
78,That does the work of who is doing what to whom.,1330940.0,1336269.0
78,G: You can depict what he's doing or embodying him?,1336270.0,1338499.0
78,"H: Yes, exactly.",1338500.0,1339499.0
78,You can do it quite easily and demonstrate it clearly and easily because you already,1339500.0,1346369.0
78,know from context that that's who it is.,1346370.0,1349969.0
78,"G: Because if it was someone else, you'd have to introduce that person instead.",1349970.0,1354048.0
78,"H: Yes, sort of.",1354049.0,1356616.0
78,[Laughter] It just depends on the reference -- depends what it is.,1356617.0,1363902.0
78,"For example, there are some referents in the story that were specific animals.",1363903.0,1372992.0
78,"Well, they were animals that we don't have in Australia.",1372993.0,1377907.0
78,There were some animals that did crop up like there were 'ground rats.',1377908.0,1382722.0
78,I think they're called 'moles' or something.,1382723.0,1384530.0
78,"G: Sure. 'Groundhogs,' 'moles.'",1384531.0,1388366.0
78,"H: Yeah, something like that.",1388367.0,1390627.0
78,"If you look at The Frog Story book, you can see what the animal is there,",1390628.0,1395577.0
78,"but with the wolf story, there were sheep.",1395578.0,1398805.0
78,And we do have sheep in Australia.,1398806.0,1401246.0
78,"Whereas, yeah, everyone knows what a wolf is.",1401247.0,1404974.0
78,It was different for the other story with the groundhogs or moles.,1404975.0,1407730.0
78,We did look at that.,1407731.0,1409329.0
78,And it wasn't just the specific referent but also what animal or object was known to,1409330.0,1417439.0
78,"d/Deaf people to be able to then reproduce that, so that people knew what you were talking",1417440.0,1422229.0
78,about.,1422230.0,1423229.0
78,"Clearly, depicting signs were very important when the referent wasn't known or when you",1423230.0,1431308.0
78,needed to add additional information.,1431309.0,1433918.0
78,That helped to then develop the understanding of the viewer.,1433919.0,1438839.0
78,That's a big reason why depiction is very important.,1438840.0,1441319.0
78,"G: You can just say, you know, 'some sort of small critter' even if you don't have",1441320.0,1447889.0
78,a specific name for it or don't recognise it and don't expect the other person to,1447890.0,1453159.0
78,recognise it.,1453160.0,1454159.0
78,"H: Yeah, you can just show it.",1454160.0,1455709.0
78,"G: So, you worked on narratives.",1455710.0,1457778.0
78,You worked on how reference works.,1457779.0,1460529.0
78,And what else?,1460530.0,1462729.0
78,"H: Well, I also did a lot of community projects.",1462730.0,1467939.0
78,One example is I worked with a really exciting project -- an English to Auslan translation,1467940.0,1477339.0
78,project.,1477340.0,1478339.0
78,"In Australia, we have many online translations where there's a person signing a translation",1478340.0,1485939.0

78,"Della Goswell, who's at Macquarie University, set up a project to look into what d/Deaf",1496070.0,1501739.0

78,"and their translation abilities, and who would be the translators.",1508740.0,1512139.0

78,Her name is Stef Linder.,1525929.0,1529629.0

78,It was more about the Deaf community here who often view translations.,1573450.0,1582949.0
78,It might be information that is health related.,1582950.0,1586939.0
78,It could be Government services like Centrelink information.,1586940.0,1590229.0
78,It could be news like the Deaf Society might distribute news and events -- information,1590230.0,1593759.0

78,They can then access the information in Auslan.,1646909.0,1650569.0

79,"a question about these two alternatives and getting you to pick one, and actually,",326820.0,330059.0
79,"if you were to bring both, maybe that'd be kind of weird because I'm actually gonna get",330060.0,332699.0

79,and bring an ice cream cake though. G: Ice cream cake is always acceptable.,335940.0,339719.0
79,L: Exactly where you go up in the phrase can really change the effect that the intonation,339720.0,345959.0
79,"has on the sentence. Questions rise up towards the end, but that's very different to another type of",345960.0,353039.0
79,rising up which is a phrase specifically known as a 'high-rising terminal' but which you may know as,353040.0,358199.0

79,"up is a little bit different. So, you can tell the difference between a question and uptalk.",364080.0,368459.0
79,G: I think this is particularly interesting because when it comes to writing people often,368460.0,373259.0
79,"use a question mark to indicate both types of intonation. So, if you're saying something like,",373260.0,377699.0
79,'Ice cream?' But I think most people can actually tell the difference. Can I say them both to you,377700.0,382019.0
79,and see which one you think is which? L: Yeah.,382020.0,383579.0
79,"G: Here's Number One, 'There's some ice cream?' and Number Two, 'There's some ice cream?'",383580.0,389639.0
79,"L: That first one goes up and stays up earlier and stronger, which sounds much more like uptalk",389640.0,395279.0
79,than a question to me. We use that to indicate that someone wants to continue saying something.,395280.0,400079.0
79,"G: Then in the second one, that's more of a question which actually goes down first",400080.0,404699.0
79,and then up towards the end. That's 'There's some ice cream?' and 'There's some ice cream?',404700.0,411479.0
79,where I'm deliberately going 'ice cream' -- just going straight up over going down,411480.0,415919.0
79,"versus up. There's this difference here, even though we're not very precise about writing",415920.0,420419.0
79,"these sorts of intonational contours in English. People tend to use a question mark for both, and",420420.0,424199.0
79,it's obvious from context. But it's fascinating to me that we can actually hear the difference.,424200.0,428339.0
79,"L: When it comes to analysing the difference, sometimes linguists will literally draw a",428340.0,433919.0
79,little up and down pitch contour over the top of a sentence to show that the question one does have,433920.0,439619.0
79,that downward before upward movement. G: I love these. I feel like,439620.0,443459.0

79,"they are somewhat subjective, but they do show you the difference between the two patterns.",446400.0,450449.0
79,G: I love this style. I think it's really quite easy to read. You often see them in typewritten,450450.0,455339.0
79,"manuscripts because it's a little bit hard to do digitally, but it's sort of easy to just draw with",455340.0,458759.0

79,"harder to do things like technical comparison with because you're drawing this very analogue curve,",462600.0,466919.0
79,"and then you're looking at another sentence and being like, 'Okay, is that the exact same",466920.0,469859.0
79,shape that this person drew? Or did this little dip -- was that just like their hand,469860.0,472979.0
79,"got jogged or did they mean something by it?' L: Other systems involve using notation, like",472980.0,478979.0
79,you might use 'H' for the bit that's high and 'L' for the bit that's low. I've seen other notation,478980.0,483419.0
79,systems that use arrows as well to indicate those upward and downward movements in the melody.,483420.0,488219.0
79,"G: Yeah, the H and L one I feel like is relatively intuitive, although when you start combining it,",488220.0,493259.0
79,it can get quite complicated. I've also seen people use numbering systems where you number,493260.0,497279.0
79,pitches from one to four. The problem with this for me is that some people prefer a version where,497280.0,502799.0
79,"'one' is low and 'four' is high, and some systems do the exact opposite thing, so when I see pitch",502800.0,507299.0

79,system is before getting into things is a thing I've learnt when it comes to number systems.,512580.0,517019.0
79,G: Absolutely. I think that pitch systems are something where they've been one of the,517020.0,521459.0
79,"hardest things for me to learn at a technical level because when it comes to something like,",521460.0,526379.0

79,"write down a bunch of symbols for them,' that's something that I was able to learn in a relatively",530040.0,533579.0
79,concrete way. But pitch is this thing that's overlaid on top of the individual sounds and,533580.0,538799.0
79,applies to the whole syllable or to the whole word or the whole sentence and has taken me,538800.0,543059.0
79,"quite a while to be able to train my ear to hear rather than just perceiving the sentence as like,",543060.0,548579.0
79,"'This is a question,' or 'This is angry,' or 'This is curious,' or something like that.",548580.0,551639.0
79,L: I think it takes practice to step away because it is something that is often used,551640.0,557279.0
79,"for that kind of emotional and stylistic effect, so it can be harder to step back and think about",557280.0,563099.0
79,what's actually being done with intonation versus other things that we use strategically to create,563100.0,569459.0

79,"just how much it is dependent on the specific language, it can help you think a little bit",581280.0,587039.0
79,about what's happening with intonation. A thing like having rising intonation at the,587040.0,592739.0
79,end of a question where it goes up is not something that happens in all languages.,592740.0,596219.0
79,"G: I mean, I was calling this 'question' intonation, but does every language ask",596220.0,601379.0
79,"questions by doing this low and then high thing? L: A lot of languages do, but that doesn't mean",601380.0,606119.0
79,that it's all languages do it. Hawaiian is a language that has,606120.0,610379.0
79,"falling question intonation, as an example. G: This is the Indigenous language of Hawai'i?",610380.0,614699.0
79,L: Yeah. And what's really interesting is that the Hawaiian creole that has arisen because of the,614700.0,619739.0
79,contact between Hawaiian and English has actually continued to use that falling question intonation,619740.0,624959.0
79,"instead of English rising question intonation. G: Oh, that's really neat. That's something that's",624960.0,629099.0

79,"G: Question intonation is easy to talk about, but there're also other things that pitch is doing.",631980.0,636419.0

79,and we were using opposite high-low metaphors. I was using a spatial one; he was using a,2258640.0,2263499.0
79,social status one. We ended up coming up with an agreement where we would just talk about whether,2263500.0,2268719.0

80,how it's inspired by performative utterances. G: If you give someone a complement for being,1632240.0,1637939.0
80,"beautiful, and that person is a woman, then you are reassociating that link between 'beautiful'",1637940.0,1644719.0

80,"saying, 'I wanna try to delink these things.' L: Every time you choose pink for a girl and",1652940.0,1657079.0
80,"blue for a boy, you're continuing this Western focus on these colours being representative of",1657080.0,1662659.0
80,these genders for babies even though these are relatively new ways of doing that. Those colours,1662660.0,1668059.0

80,technology has also shaped how we perform certain types of things because there's a thing that,1768440.0,1774559.0

80,"or more, yeah, closer to the physical thing. L: One of the things we've been coming back to",1801080.0,1806359.0
80,is this tension between spoken language having a lot of power and written language not necessarily,1806360.0,1812599.0

81,to see at the farm we're going to say,102780.0,104219.0
81,all kinds of animals that we're going to,104220.0,106019.0
81,use as our example sentences uh the,106020.0,108419.0
81,first is this horse and the horse is,108420.0,110699.0
81,eating grass ah look at the horse the,110700.0,113938.0
81,horse has eaten an apple oh what a nice,113939.0,116938.0
81,treat both sentences the horse is eating,116939.0,119879.0
81,grass and the horse has eaten an apple,119880.0,121618.0
81,uh about the verb eat but they're,121619.0,124258.0
81,structured a little differently yeah,124259.0,126179.0
81,they've got something in common which is,126180.0,128519.0
81,that they have a main verb eat is eating,128520.0,131399.0
81,grass has eaten an apple and also a,131400.0,134159.0
81,second helping verb that's less,134160.0,135958.0
81,important when it comes to how we'd like,135959.0,137579.0
81,draw a nice picture of the scenario but,137580.0,140579.0
81,gives us some useful grammatical,140580.0,142019.0
81,information and these verbs have their,142020.0,144539.0
81,own life as well when they're not,144540.0,146759.0
81,hanging out alongside another verb and,146760.0,148679.0
81,helping it so the horse is eating grass,148680.0,151619.0
81,is the same verb as in the horse is an,151620.0,154679.0
81,animal here is is doing the work of,154680.0,157679.0
81,painting a picture of what's happening,157680.0,159839.0
81,there is is the whole verb by itself it,159840.0,162479.0
81,doesn't have any helpers and the same,162480.0,164399.0
81,thing with something like the horse has,164400.0,166919.0
81,an apple oh lucky horse lucky horse we,166920.0,170518.0
81,don't know whether it's eaten yet but,170519.0,172139.0
81,the has there doesn't have any helpers,172140.0,174539.0
81,it's not helping it's just the only verb,174540.0,176518.0
81,whereas in the horse is eating grass the,176519.0,179039.0
81,horse has eaten an apple you have eat,179040.0,181919.0
81,which is your sort of primary verb star,181920.0,183958.0
81,of the show and then that is or has,183959.0,186419.0
81,that's helping it out and those burby,186420.0,188639.0
81,things that are helping another verb are,188640.0,190619.0
81,known as auxiliary verbs yeah auxiliary,190620.0,193979.0
81,is the type of terminology like wow,193980.0,196499.0
81,that's a long word for such a short verb,196500.0,200359.0
81,yes the very fancy word for when often,200360.0,204719.0
81,very short verbs I use to help another,204720.0,207419.0
81,verb and it's because it's just the very,207420.0,209639.0
81,fancy French borrowed word for help yeah,209640.0,213539.0
81,it's this French word which was brought,213540.0,214799.0
81,from Latin meaning helpful or eating you,214800.0,217439.0
81,do sometimes see an auxiliary,217440.0,220199.0
81,um like an auxiliary Armed Force or like,220200.0,223018.0
81,a ladies accelerating like a historical,223019.0,224939.0
81,military context true yes that is where,224940.0,228598.0
81,you may have also encountered the word,228599.0,229919.0
81,auxiliary outside of linguistics yeah I,229920.0,233039.0
81,wouldn't say it's super common but there,233040.0,235378.0
81,we go you know sometimes you do see,235379.0,237359.0
81,people just refer to them as helping,237360.0,239158.0
81,words which is also extremely defensible,239159.0,242098.0
81,but the technical formal word that,242099.0,244919.0
81,linguists use is auxiliary which is,244920.0,247139.0
81,sometimes shortened nicely to Ox just,247140.0,249719.0
81,aux,249720.0,250919.0
81,and we have auxiliary verbs in English,250920.0,253318.0
81,like the examples we just shared and we,253319.0,256319.0
81,can explore how auxiliary verbs work in,256320.0,259078.0
81,other languages as well thanks to a very,259079.0,261899.0
81,conveniently timed launch of a new,261900.0,264119.0
81,database called gram Bank this is very,264120.0,266399.0
81,good in coincidental timing if you've,266400.0,268439.0
81,listened to previous episodes of Link,268440.0,269879.0
81,theories you might have heard us talk,269880.0,271019.0
81,about walls which is the world atlas of,271020.0,273119.0
81,linguistic structures which does these,273120.0,275159.0
81,cool diagrams of where various,275160.0,277079.0
81,linguistic features are found Graham,277080.0,279119.0
81,bank is sort of like the new walls so,279120.0,281698.0
81,let's talk a little bit about do you,281699.0,283198.0
81,know the history of how these two sites,283199.0,285719.0
81,came to be walls has been our go-to for,285720.0,289019.0
81,almost 20 years it started out in 2005,289020.0,291779.0
81,as a CD-ROM oh my God I didn't realize,291780.0,295439.0
81,that it used to be a city ROM and only,295440.0,297478.0
81,came online in 2008 the way that walls,297479.0,300539.0
81,works is that an individual researcher,300540.0,302339.0
81,would come up with a question and they,302340.0,304379.0
81,would survey as many grammars as they,304380.0,305999.0
81,could and then share their results the,306000.0,309239.0
81,way that gram Bank works is instead said,309240.0,311279.0
81,they started with almost 200 different,311280.0,313499.0
81,features of how the grammar of a,313500.0,315959.0
81,language can work and then they had a,315960.0,318779.0
81,massive team there's over 100 named,318780.0,320519.0
81,authors on the grand Bank big initial,320520.0,323219.0
81,publication and those 100 plus authors,323220.0,326159.0
81,went through over 2 000 different,326160.0,328918.0
81,grammars of different languages looking,328919.0,331198.0
81,for each of those 195 different features,331199.0,334679.0
81,to put in the database so it's a very,334680.0,337138.0
81,different process,337139.0,338638.0
81,so that's both more questions than walls,338639.0,341279.0
81,which has around 90 some questions and,341280.0,344459.0
81,also way more languages generally when,344460.0,346619.0
81,you see a language map in walls it's got,346620.0,348179.0
81,like maybe about 500 languages somewhere,348180.0,351119.0
81,between like four and 800 languages,351120.0,353099.0
81,whereas there's like thousands of,353100.0,355319.0
81,languages in each of the grand Bank,355320.0,357418.0
81,databases not the full maybe 7000 that,357419.0,360599.0
81,we think exist but like 2000 2500 is,360600.0,363659.0
81,certainly a lot closer to having some,363660.0,365339.0
81,sense of like what do things look like,365340.0,367138.0
81,cross-linguistically and so to pull an,367139.0,370079.0
81,example of a grammar completely not at,370080.0,372418.0
81,random one of the one of the coders used,372419.0,375659.0
81,my grammar of lam Jung yolmo and they,375660.0,378239.0
81,picked up the grammar and they opened it,378240.0,380399.0
81,up and they literally went through their,380400.0,381839.0
81,list of 195 questions looking for the,381840.0,384299.0
81,answers in the grammar and added it to,384300.0,386698.0
81,the database and this is I think such a,386699.0,389519.0
81,tremendous example of how the work of,389520.0,392459.0
81,linguistics involves so many different,392460.0,393899.0
81,people because each of the grammars that,393900.0,396839.0
81,this database is using is input and that,396840.0,398879.0
81,a database like walls also uses as input,398880.0,400918.0
81,is written by one person or a group of,400919.0,404159.0
81,people and can be several hundred pages,404160.0,406198.0
81,long and take like five or ten years and,406199.0,408779.0
81,then you have another group of 100 plus,408780.0,411179.0
81,people spending all this time looking,411180.0,412499.0
81,through the grammars and trying to,412500.0,413939.0
81,compare them and extract things that,413940.0,416399.0
81,make them comparable to each other when,416400.0,418619.0
81,grammars are sort of written in,418620.0,420839.0
81,different Traditions at different times,420840.0,422999.0
81,by different people with different,423000.0,424739.0
81,interests and sort of try to do,424740.0,426779.0
81,something that lets you compare them,426780.0,428459.0
81,with respect to each other and one thing,428460.0,430799.0
81,that Graham Bank does really well is,430800.0,432299.0
81,that it's really transparent about the,432300.0,434339.0
81,methods that it uses there's an entire,434340.0,436019.0
81,Wiki that goes along with it that,436020.0,437758.0
81,explains the process and the methods and,437759.0,440638.0
81,what terminology they're using and why,440639.0,443098.0
81,and I think that really helps to make,443099.0,446219.0
81,sure that everyone is as much on the,446220.0,448559.0
81,same page as possible when it comes to,448560.0,450119.0
81,making these decisions and if you had,450120.0,452339.0
81,somebody who's writing a new grammar,452340.0,453478.0
81,they could look at these 195 questions,453479.0,455399.0
81,and say I could just provide answers for,455400.0,457499.0
81,them you know in an appendix or,457500.0,459538.0
81,something at the end so you could just,459539.0,460619.0
81,encode them more directly in a future,460620.0,463258.0
81,version of grambank are they planning on,463259.0,464879.0
81,doing that this is definitely version,464880.0,466679.0
81,1.0 and there is scope to expand both,466680.0,470519.0
81,the number of features they look at and,470520.0,472379.0
81,the number of grammars that are included,472380.0,474418.0
81,in the future which is also really,474419.0,476219.0
81,exciting and it's all freely available,476220.0,477959.0
81,online so if you want to poke around and,477960.0,479939.0
81,see what's in it that's a thing that,479940.0,481198.0
81,anybody can do walls absolutely still,481199.0,483538.0
81,has value I'm sure that we will continue,483539.0,485818.0
81,to refer to it when it's useful but I'm,485819.0,488939.0
81,excited that we'll also get to use,488940.0,490079.0
81,Graham bank for future episodes as well,490080.0,492239.0
81,yeah and they ask slightly different,492240.0,493739.0
81,sets of questions so it's still worth,493740.0,495179.0
81,having both sets of resources but since,495180.0,497879.0
81,we have auxiliaries today and since,497880.0,501059.0
81,walls doesn't do much with auxiliaries,501060.0,502859.0
81,this is a great time to say what does,502860.0,504959.0
81,Graham Bank tell us about auxiliaries in,504960.0,507119.0
81,2000 and plus languages and before we do,507120.0,509758.0
81,that we have to decide what is an,509759.0,511739.0
81,auxiliary in any given language like all,511740.0,514859.0
81,of those people that wrote those two and,514860.0,516898.0
81,a half thousand references that are,516899.0,518579.0
81,included in crambank and that means that,518580.0,521278.0
81,we have to think about what are some of,521279.0,523199.0
81,the most important features when we're,523200.0,524579.0
81,talking about something as an auxiliary,524580.0,526439.0
81,right so I think a sort of basic working,526440.0,529499.0
81,definition of an auxiliary is that when,529500.0,532979.0
81,you have multiple verbs in the same,532980.0,535799.0
81,phrase like has eaten and one of them,535800.0,539278.0
81,contributes the most to the meaning and,539279.0,541499.0
81,other ones have grammatical function and,541500.0,544439.0
81,don't really have much with their own,544440.0,546359.0
81,meaning so in something like the horse,546360.0,548639.0
81,has an apple have has a meaning of,548640.0,551639.0
81,owning or possession or belonging to,551640.0,554699.0
81,whereas and something like the horse has,554700.0,556619.0
81,eaten it's not the horse owns or,556620.0,558719.0
81,possesses or belongs to the state of,558720.0,561479.0
81,having Eden so it's an auxiliary in that,561480.0,564958.0
81,case where it's helping out the other,564959.0,566518.0
81,verb with grammatical functions and as,566519.0,568859.0
81,we're going through these examples I,568860.0,570359.0
81,think just like we might go for a wander,570360.0,572398.0
81,around the hypothetical Farm we're,572399.0,574079.0
81,talking about today we're also just,574080.0,575819.0
81,wandering through these examples and not,575820.0,577979.0
81,getting too bogged down or making a,577980.0,579539.0
81,complete list we have that list in the,579540.0,581699.0
81,Cambridge grammar of the English,581700.0,582719.0
81,language it's a very big and heavy book,582720.0,585479.0
81,speaking of reference works that take,585480.0,587458.0
81,multiple people to do this is also some,587459.0,589859.0
81,thousand plus pages and has like 12,589860.0,592079.0
81,co-authors you know there's many people,592080.0,594599.0
81,at every level of this process trying to,594600.0,596398.0
81,describe what's going on in a language,596399.0,597719.0
81,so this is not an exhaustive tour so in,597720.0,600059.0
81,English we've talked about is and has,600060.0,601979.0
81,having auxiliary functions we also have,601980.0,605219.0
81,do as in the horse does eat grass which,605220.0,608458.0
81,is different to do in its main form as,608459.0,611759.0
81,the horse does a dance maybe for some,611760.0,614278.0
81,dressage,614279.0,615419.0
81,there's just a little dance just a,615420.0,617579.0
81,little jump that's sort of do as it's,617580.0,620159.0
81,canonical by itself independent verb,620160.0,622619.0
81,form whereas the horse does eat grass is,622620.0,625139.0
81,doing a grammatical thing similarly with,625140.0,627599.0
81,an example like the grass was eaten by,627600.0,630539.0
81,the horse Maybe by a stray goat,630540.0,633898.0
81,um the was there is doing a grammatical,633899.0,637259.0
81,thing and Eaton is the main verb the,637260.0,640079.0
81,cross was eaten by the horse is a really,640080.0,641639.0
81,Nifty example of how the auxiliary is,641640.0,643799.0
81,helping by making the grass the focus,643800.0,645898.0
81,and creating this passive structure,645899.0,648479.0
81,right so sometimes like the horse is,648480.0,651119.0
81,eating grass or the horse has eaten,651120.0,653159.0
81,grass this locates the event of grass,653160.0,655919.0
81,eating in time and sort of the timeline,655920.0,659099.0
81,of how this event has happened and,659100.0,660539.0
81,sometimes it can change how the entities,660540.0,663479.0
81,in the sentence relate to each other,663480.0,664919.0
81,there's lots of different things that,664920.0,665999.0
81,auxiliaries can do another example of,666000.0,668759.0
81,what auxiliaries can do that's not from,668760.0,670919.0
81,my variety of English is the horse be,670920.0,673078.0
81,eating grass in African-American,673079.0,675239.0
81,vernacular English where instead of the,675240.0,677699.0
81,is form of the verb you have the B form,677700.0,679739.0
81,and that means that it's being used in a,679740.0,682199.0
81,way that means the horse regularly or,682200.0,684119.0
81,habitually eats grass right which I,684120.0,686278.0
81,think is a true thing about horses I,686279.0,688139.0
81,think so neither of us are particularly,688140.0,690119.0
81,uh horse experts one of the papers that,690120.0,692939.0
81,I like to cite about this construction,692940.0,694018.0
81,which is called habitual the uses cookie,694019.0,696359.0
81,monster be eating cookies as the example,696360.0,698458.0
81,which is definitely true about Cookie,698459.0,700379.0
81,Monsters And even if Cookie Monster is,700380.0,702778.0
81,not currently eating cookies this is a,702779.0,704578.0
81,thing that is habitually true about,704579.0,706018.0
81,Cookie Monster as a as an entity it has,706019.0,708539.0
81,a really helpful auxiliary yeah so it's,708540.0,710939.0
81,interesting how auxiliaries are often,710940.0,713999.0
81,drawn from this relatively limited set,714000.0,715859.0
81,of words and here we've seen b and E's,715860.0,719518.0
81,which are part of the same verb be used,719519.0,721139.0
81,in three different ways as slightly,721140.0,723119.0
81,different flavors of auxiliary in,723120.0,724679.0
81,English because it's sort of this small,724680.0,727199.0
81,whole set of auxiliaries then you can do,727200.0,728939.0
81,all these interesting grammatical things,728940.0,730259.0
81,with them and there are all these,730260.0,731939.0
81,Downstream effects of what happens when,731940.0,734278.0
81,you have an auxiliary so because it's,734279.0,736319.0
81,being used to help in terms of what it's,736320.0,738359.0
81,contributing to the grammar it means,738360.0,740458.0
81,that it's not coming along with its own,740459.0,742319.0
81,meaning as Central and because they no,742320.0,745319.0
81,longer bring their own meaning while,745320.0,747179.0
81,they're helping you get sentences which,747180.0,749398.0
81,if you don't treat them as an auxiliary,749399.0,751199.0
81,sound a little bit contradictory so I am,751200.0,754199.0
81,going to come to the farm because going,754200.0,756359.0
81,is the auxiliary there you can use it,756360.0,758338.0
81,with come which has the opposite meaning,758339.0,760679.0
81,if you're thinking about the meaning of,760680.0,762059.0
81,both of these verbs can you say I'm,762060.0,764398.0
81,coming to go to the farm it would be,764399.0,766499.0
81,like I'm coming to your house and then,766500.0,767879.0
81,we'll go to the farm oh yeah so it's not,767880.0,770338.0
81,really an auxiliary the one that I,770339.0,772439.0
81,really like is so have which can be an,772440.0,775499.0
81,auxiliary or not an auxiliary is very,775500.0,778439.0
81,often pronounced differently in English,778440.0,780659.0
81,it's spelled the same way but it's,780660.0,782458.0
81,pronounced different English depending,782459.0,783958.0
81,on which one it is huh let me try this,783959.0,786479.0
81,little uh quiz for you,786480.0,788759.0
81,if I say I have two pens,788760.0,792499.0
81,versus I have to pen up the chickens,792500.0,796078.0
81,okay did you notice the difference,796079.0,798299.0
81,between how to have is pronounced there,798300.0,799819.0
81,I have two pens and I have to I have to,799820.0,805199.0
81,I I have to pan out the chicks I could,805200.0,808078.0
81,make that really short yeah and one of,808079.0,811018.0
81,them is have pronounced with the V I,811019.0,813539.0
81,have two the other one is have to pen,813540.0,816179.0
81,with like an F sound which you could,816180.0,818159.0
81,write like have to it would be sort of,818160.0,820439.0
81,weird I think to say I have to pens to,820440.0,823499.0
81,mean I have two pens I don't think I can,823500.0,825659.0
81,do that,825660.0,826559.0
81,she has to she has to duck because the,826560.0,831179.0
81,chicken is flying over her head versus,831180.0,832679.0
81,she has two ducks right so that's has,832680.0,835919.0
81,which gets pronounced with like a zed,835920.0,838138.0
81,when it's has two ducks so when it's,838139.0,841138.0
81,helping it's no longer the star of the,841139.0,842879.0
81,show we can kind of smooth down the,842880.0,845819.0
81,edges of how we pronounce it,845820.0,848039.0
81,and make that s or that V more like the,848040.0,850919.0
81,T that's coming after and yeah change,850920.0,853259.0
81,this out to she has to duck I think if,853260.0,855479.0
81,you say something like she has two duck,855480.0,857458.0
81,it sounds very formal like you can do it,857459.0,859619.0
81,but it sounds very very formal I have to,859620.0,862439.0
81,pen up the chickens she has two duck,862440.0,868439.0
81,I just have to say it so slowly in order,868440.0,871379.0
81,to not make the two into two and the,871380.0,874859.0
81,have into half and half and that works,874860.0,877919.0
81,for other ones as well like I'm gonna,877920.0,880138.0
81,come to the farm right like I'm gonna,880139.0,882719.0
81,the farm maybe you can say it in some,882720.0,884999.0
81,very informal or relaxed varieties,885000.0,887939.0
81,that's a very informal Australian,887940.0,890039.0
81,sounding pronunciation there but like,890040.0,892619.0
81,I'm gonna milk the cows or something is,892620.0,894778.0
81,very like that's just the one that means,894779.0,896999.0
81,to the Future one that I like is so you,897000.0,899879.0
81,can say I've gone away you've reduced,899880.0,902039.0
81,that have you know the auxiliary it's,902040.0,903958.0
81,shortened from I have gone away have,903959.0,906539.0
81,just reduced to the there but I've the,906540.0,909599.0
81,milk do you do you have that oh now you,909600.0,912179.0
81,sound British in my head yeah I I have,912180.0,915479.0
81,the milk and I have the eggs,915480.0,917879.0
81,um I think I would have to say in my,917880.0,919739.0
81,Canadian English I would say I've got,919740.0,921179.0
81,the milk or something like that I'd have,921180.0,922979.0
81,to reinforce the meaning there if I want,922980.0,924659.0
81,to shorten it yeah and I really don't,924660.0,927059.0
81,think I would say I to go to mean I have,927060.0,930719.0
81,to go,930720.0,931919.0
81,no much harder to shorten a main verb,931920.0,935398.0
81,than a helper verb yeah I could say I,935399.0,937919.0
81,gotta go I have to go but it's not quite,937920.0,940919.0
81,something I can shorten in that context,940920.0,942958.0
81,so auxiliaries tend to have these sorts,942959.0,944698.0
81,of contractions,944699.0,946319.0
81,umbecause they're sort of grammary,946320.0,948119.0
81,things they're very high frequency fun,948120.0,950759.0
81,fact about high frequency yes so there's,950760.0,953338.0
81,a very fun study that finds that words,953339.0,956219.0
81,that are unexpected in their context or,956220.0,958018.0
81,that are less frequent overall in a,958019.0,960659.0
81,language tend to be produced over a,960660.0,962939.0
81,longer period of time like slower with,962940.0,965159.0
81,longer duration the example from this,965160.0,967499.0
81,that I really like which is uh so,967500.0,969898.0
81,there's a word can't like a thieves,969899.0,972299.0
81,can't or a you know the cant of the,972300.0,975119.0
81,streets and you can tell by me saying it,975120.0,977999.0
81,sort of with the definition it's not,978000.0,979559.0
81,super common like an Argo you know like,979560.0,982259.0
81,I I heard the cant of the streets going,982260.0,984299.0
81,through the night this tends to be,984300.0,985919.0
81,produced much longer and slower and more,985920.0,988739.0
81,precisely than I can't as in I can't go,988740.0,991859.0
81,uh I cannot go,991860.0,993898.0
81,I can't say can't with the same vowel so,993899.0,996539.0
81,uh it doesn't work for me but it does,996540.0,998758.0
81,make sense because these auxiliaries are,998759.0,1001159.0
81,really hard-working helpers they turn up,1001160.0,1002898.0
81,in sentences so often and they don't,1002899.0,1005119.0
81,contribute that meaning it makes sense,1005120.0,1006799.0
81,that they would be the thing most likely,1006800.0,1008659.0
81,to reduce yeah they're sort of squished,1008660.0,1010819.0
81,down because they're just sort of being,1010820.0,1012338.0
81,grammatical glue between the sort of big,1012339.0,1016219.0
81,meaning heavy chunks of words,1016220.0,1018739.0
81,and once we figure out okay this counts,1018740.0,1022518.0
81,as an auxiliary it's helping the verb in,1022519.0,1025399.0
81,this language we can then start saying,1025400.0,1027318.0
81,like what else do auxiliaries do in a,1027319.0,1030678.0
81,particular language that might be of,1030679.0,1032779.0
81,interest when you start zooming in very,1032780.0,1034698.0
81,narrowly on one language,1034699.0,1036198.0
81,I know auxiliaries and how we ask,1036199.0,1038479.0
81,questions in English interact in,1038480.0,1040399.0
81,interesting ways right let's look at,1040400.0,1042859.0
81,some examples of questions we could have,1042860.0,1045019.0
81,is the horse eating grass,1045020.0,1047418.0
81,has the horse eaten grass does the horse,1047419.0,1050719.0
81,eat grass and in all of these the,1050720.0,1053599.0
81,auxiliary is at the start is the horse,1053600.0,1055459.0
81,has the horse does the horse right and,1055460.0,1058099.0
81,eight is further back and he is further,1058100.0,1060259.0
81,back and when those same verbs are used,1060260.0,1063139.0
81,as sort of main verbs rather than,1063140.0,1064819.0
81,auxiliary is it gets a bit weirder so,1064820.0,1067579.0
81,eat the horse grass,1067580.0,1069469.0
81,[Music],1069470.0,1071678.0
81,that doesn't fit with my grandma,1071679.0,1074058.0
81,yeah this does exist in the history of,1074059.0,1076399.0
81,English it's still something you can say,1076400.0,1077899.0
81,in other Germanic languages but it's not,1077900.0,1080479.0
81,something that's for most present-day,1080480.0,1082279.0
81,English speakers how do you feel about,1082280.0,1084199.0
81,does the horse dance you sound very,1084200.0,1087019.0
81,theatrical which is usually a way of,1087020.0,1089719.0
81,saying that it is a more archaic form of,1089720.0,1092119.0
81,English what about has the horse an,1092120.0,1095119.0
81,apple yep very similar Vibes I feel like,1095120.0,1097999.0
81,that one sounds a bit British to me also,1098000.0,1099678.0
81,but is the horse an animal oh that's a,1099679.0,1102979.0
81,perfectly normal sentence to my ears I,1102980.0,1105678.0
81,sometimes have to double check after,1105679.0,1106759.0
81,hearing a bunch of things that I'm,1106760.0,1108558.0
81,questionable about oh yeah that is that,1108559.0,1111499.0
81,is a sentence that's why I did it in,1111500.0,1113298.0
81,that order just so you can have that,1113299.0,1114619.0
81,happen to you yeah so this is sort of a,1114620.0,1117678.0
81,downstream thing that happens with,1117679.0,1119479.0
81,English auxiliaries if you don't have an,1119480.0,1122239.0
81,auxiliary in the sentence like eats the,1122240.0,1125058.0
81,horse grass you have to put one in does,1125059.0,1127399.0
81,the horse eat grass or can the horse eat,1127400.0,1129859.0
81,grass but for some reason is as an,1129860.0,1132439.0
81,exception I don't know it this is a bit,1132440.0,1134839.0
81,weird you can check out our copulist,1134840.0,1136339.0
81,episode for more these are why these,1136340.0,1138499.0
81,aren't quite used as a diagnostic for,1138500.0,1140058.0
81,auxiliaries it's just sort of a thing,1140059.0,1141379.0
81,that happens afterward once again,1141380.0,1143839.0
81,there's a reason the Cambridge grammar,1143840.0,1145399.0
81,of the English language is the size of a,1145400.0,1147259.0
81,relatively healthy cat,1147260.0,1149659.0
81,a nice Farm cat so far we've only had,1149660.0,1153259.0
81,examples of sentences with a single,1153260.0,1155298.0
81,auxiliary but they are so helpful that,1155299.0,1157279.0
81,they're willing to stack up and have,1157280.0,1158779.0
81,more than one to help create even more,1158780.0,1160999.0
81,complex meaning in a sentence,1161000.0,1163639.0
81,so if you leave a big barrel of apples,1163640.0,1166219.0
81,on the farm and there's a bunch of goats,1166220.0,1168079.0
81,around by the time you get back into the,1168080.0,1170418.0
81,room you might see that the apples will,1170419.0,1172519.0
81,have been being eaten by the goats for,1172520.0,1175639.0
81,the whole day oh no it's a sad situation,1175640.0,1178579.0
81,but a very exciting use of what's that,1178580.0,1181519.0
81,for auxiliaries will have been being yep,1181520.0,1185659.0
81,and then eaten exciting day for the,1185660.0,1187879.0
81,goats exciting day for the auxiliary is,1187880.0,1189499.0
81,not so exciting for the humans who want,1189500.0,1190819.0
81,to eat the apples then we still have one,1190820.0,1192678.0
81,main verb which is eaten because that's,1192679.0,1194538.0
81,still the action that's happening and,1194539.0,1196159.0
81,then all of these other auxiliaries are,1196160.0,1198319.0
81,telling us things about how and when and,1198320.0,1200839.0
81,under what circumstances this event,1200840.0,1202879.0
81,happened so do heaven B are doing a lot,1202880.0,1205639.0
81,of heavy lifting in English we also had,1205640.0,1208159.0
81,a whole episode on modals which are also,1208160.0,1210918.0
81,like auxiliaries in a lot of ways yeah,1210919.0,1213678.0
81,bottles are sort of interesting in,1213679.0,1215239.0
81,English because they don't act like full,1215240.0,1218418.0
81,verbs so you can't just say I can the,1218419.0,1222739.0
81,Apple yeah or I will the Apple I should,1222740.0,1226099.0
81,the Apple but you can use them in the,1226100.0,1228918.0
81,same sort of auxiliary slot and helping,1228919.0,1230959.0
81,slot as other auxiliaries that are verbs,1230960.0,1233719.0
81,so sometimes people talk about sort of,1233720.0,1235038.0
81,auxiliaries as a category that includes,1235039.0,1237499.0
81,verbs that are definitely verby like be,1237500.0,1240139.0
81,and have and do and other things that,1240140.0,1243379.0
81,are maybe not Furby but they're still,1243380.0,1245599.0
81,doing what seems to be the same sort of,1245600.0,1247159.0
81,helping thing as these helping verbs and,1247160.0,1250339.0
81,alongside our really common helpers,1250340.0,1251839.0
81,there are some occasional helpers let is,1251840.0,1254599.0
81,a really nice example something like,1254600.0,1256579.0
81,let's go yeah let's go which is,1256580.0,1259819.0
81,originally let us go which sounds very,1259820.0,1262099.0
81,formal to me and doesn't quite say mean,1262100.0,1264319.0
81,the same thing as like Let My People Go,1264320.0,1266418.0
81,let us go it just means like,1266419.0,1269719.0
81,shall we go or let Let's us the group of,1269720.0,1272959.0
81,us go or let there be light let there be,1272960.0,1276499.0
81,peace which is sort of used as a formal,1276500.0,1278659.0
81,command so let can be an auxiliary,1278660.0,1280759.0
81,because you have these other main verbs,1280760.0,1282678.0
81,like go and be and that's a really nice,1282679.0,1284959.0
81,example of how auxiliaries can kind of,1284960.0,1288379.0
81,Fork off from their main verb usage and,1288380.0,1291379.0
81,go on their own little adventures and,1291380.0,1293839.0
81,they're often kind of weird or irregular,1293840.0,1295939.0
81,because they'll keep this grammatical,1295940.0,1297678.0
81,function that's separate from their main,1297679.0,1299599.0
81,meaning function yeah this grammatical,1299600.0,1302538.0
81,idiosyncrasy of auxiliaries was,1302539.0,1304519.0
81,something that came up a lot when I was,1304520.0,1305658.0
81,learning French I know you haven't,1305659.0,1307399.0
81,studied French but my experience with,1307400.0,1309859.0
81,French was they spent years and years,1309860.0,1311839.0
81,and years uh learning this one,1311840.0,1314178.0
81,particular thing about French verbs,1314179.0,1316759.0
81,which is known as the passe composer,1316760.0,1318499.0
81,which is how to make a certain type of,1318500.0,1320119.0
81,past verb in French that if you were,1320120.0,1322819.0
81,translating literally you could,1322820.0,1324379.0
81,translate to something like I have eaten,1324380.0,1326418.0
81,I have arrived but it's used to just,1326419.0,1329779.0
81,mean a sort of General past thing like,1329780.0,1331459.0
81,there's a there's a have word there but,1331460.0,1333259.0
81,it's used to be in a past thing oh it's,1333260.0,1335119.0
81,nice that it uses have as an auxiliary,1335120.0,1337219.0
81,like English does big shout out to have,1337220.0,1339499.0
81,I feel like we could have a whole have,1339500.0,1341119.0
81,episode we really could and in this case,1341120.0,1343999.0
81,it is have most of the time but,1344000.0,1346219.0
81,sometimes instead of have it's be I okay,1346220.0,1348739.0
81,this is why it took so long to learn,1348740.0,1350779.0
81,yeah they mean the same thing there's,1350780.0,1353298.0
81,just for a word like eat you use have,1353299.0,1356959.0
81,but for a word like arrive or come or,1356960.0,1360678.0
81,descend you use B okay so it's our old,1360679.0,1363859.0
81,friends having B but in this case it's,1363860.0,1366259.0
81,like some verbs get have and some verbs,1366260.0,1367939.0
81,get B this is actually something that,1367940.0,1370639.0
81,existed historically in English and,1370640.0,1373699.0
81,still exists in a little bit in German,1373700.0,1375879.0
81,where you can kind of say in English I,1375880.0,1378739.0
81,have come or I am arrived,1378740.0,1381259.0
81,true they both work in a way that with,1381260.0,1385519.0
81,other types of verbs if you say,1385520.0,1387918.0
81,something like I am laughed okay that,1387919.0,1391999.0
81,definitely doesn't fit well with my,1392000.0,1393558.0
81,intuitions,1393559.0,1394819.0
81,no or if you say I am eating again well,1394820.0,1398538.0
81,that means something very different,1398539.0,1400939.0
81,you've got to stay away from those goats,1400940.0,1402798.0
81,they're very vicious,1402799.0,1404959.0
81,help helpI'm being eaten alive,1404960.0,1406359.0
81,[Laughter],1406360.0,1408079.0
81,yeah but you can say I am arrived in a,1408080.0,1410719.0
81,way that's oh little bit old-fashioned,1410720.0,1412879.0
81,oldie time in English but doesn't sound,1412880.0,1414558.0
81,nearly as out there as I am laughed for,1414559.0,1417379.0
81,I have laughed yeah but in French this,1417380.0,1419839.0
81,is obligatory that some verbs are like,1419840.0,1421519.0
81,James I have eaten and some verbs are,1421520.0,1424099.0
81,like they I am arrived and this is this,1424100.0,1427339.0
81,whole thing that you need to just learn,1427340.0,1429079.0
81,if you're learning French it's also the,1429080.0,1431178.0
81,case in Italian there's some stuff,1431179.0,1434678.0
81,in Spanish about like which auxiliary,1434679.0,1438379.0
81,verb you need to choose when in these,1438380.0,1440959.0
81,particular grammatical circumstances,1440960.0,1442279.0
81,that is the kind of thing that shows up,1442280.0,1444918.0
81,if you're learning one of these,1444919.0,1446178.0
81,languages and a good reminder even if,1446179.0,1448519.0
81,two languages use their languages verb,1448520.0,1451939.0
81,for have doesn't mean they always use,1451940.0,1453678.0
81,them in exactly the same places and in,1453679.0,1455599.0
81,exactly the same ways,1455600.0,1457279.0
81,right one of my favorite examples of how,1457280.0,1460279.0
81,a word can become sort of,1460280.0,1461739.0
81,grammaticalized and then almost lose its,1461740.0,1465019.0
81,original literal meaning comes from,1465020.0,1466699.0
81,Spanish okay where you have a very Aber,1466700.0,1469279.0
81,which is spelled with an ancient you can,1469280.0,1470719.0
81,sort of see its roots to Latin habeo,1470720.0,1473058.0
81,which is to have and this is used for,1473059.0,1476058.0
81,grammatical functions uh like El Caballo,1476059.0,1479599.0
81,hakomira the course has eaten but it's,1479600.0,1482719.0
81,no longer really used in most cases for,1482720.0,1485178.0
81,have as in to own or to possess,1485179.0,1488239.0
81,huh so it's so helpful that it stopped,1488240.0,1490879.0
81,having its own life and now is just,1490880.0,1492798.0
81,helping out this is a metaphor you know,1492799.0,1495558.0
81,don't give up on your dreams are there,1495559.0,1500779.0
81,um so now you have tener which you you,1500780.0,1502759.0
81,know is from Latin and means something,1502760.0,1504319.0
81,like to hold or to keep and you can say,1504320.0,1506959.0
81,something like El Caballo tiene una,1506960.0,1509178.0
81,Manzana the horse has an apple as like,1509179.0,1511399.0
81,to have and to hold which is not the,1511400.0,1513859.0
81,same verb at all that's used for has,1513860.0,1515658.0
81,eaten but historically have was used for,1515659.0,1518899.0
81,both and then they were like oh no let's,1518900.0,1520339.0
81,let's take this other one to mean the,1520340.0,1522918.0
81,more literal meaning of have,1522919.0,1524778.0
81,on the topic of same verb Latin habeo,1524779.0,1528319.0
81,and English have related not related,1528320.0,1531499.0
81,ah do you know this is the thing that,1531500.0,1534139.0
81,really gets me they really look like and,1534140.0,1537558.0
81,they are not oh wow plot twist plot,1537559.0,1541699.0
81,twist they are not you could look this,1541700.0,1544399.0
81,up uh we have looked this up it's kind,1544400.0,1546918.0
81,of cute like the Wiktionary entry for,1546919.0,1548538.0
81,both habeo and for have are like they're,1548539.0,1551959.0
81,not related guys I'm sorry we promise,1551960.0,1554359.0
81,here's all the reasons,1554360.0,1556759.0
81,um which is why it's always good to,1556760.0,1558499.0
81,double check these things and in fact we,1558500.0,1560839.0
81,don't think that there was a common,1560840.0,1562459.0
81,Indo-European route for uh word meaning,1562460.0,1564918.0
81,have because it's like forked in The,1564919.0,1567619.0
81,Descendant languages ah gotta save it,1567620.0,1569658.0
81,for the have episode oh yeah sorry one,1569659.0,1572899.0
81,day we will have an episode about half,1572900.0,1575658.0
81,so acknowledging that auxiliaries can,1575659.0,1578959.0
81,look different in different languages,1578960.0,1580399.0
81,have slightly different functions have,1580400.0,1582979.0
81,different Downstream effects let's,1582980.0,1585019.0
81,return to Grand bank and have a look at,1585020.0,1586639.0
81,what they have to say about the spread,1586640.0,1588379.0
81,of auxiliaries across the world's,1588380.0,1589639.0
81,languages yeah I want to find out so the,1589640.0,1592519.0
81,nature of a database means that we can,1592520.0,1594439.0
81,look at the types of questions they have,1594440.0,1596479.0
81,asked and they've asked if auxiliaries,1596480.0,1599298.0
81,are used for a range of different,1599299.0,1601219.0
81,functions across the world's languages,1601220.0,1603158.0
81,one of those functions is as we've seen,1603159.0,1605839.0
81,in English things like is eating has,1605840.0,1608778.0
81,eaten things that have to do with when,1608779.0,1611359.0
81,and how and in relation to what an event,1611360.0,1613278.0
81,is taking place and that is the most,1613279.0,1615259.0
81,common use of auxiliary verbs across the,1615260.0,1617239.0
81,world's languages it's way more than 30,1617240.0,1619999.0
81,of the world's languages according to,1620000.0,1622219.0
81,the coding that's been done have that,1622220.0,1624619.0
81,kind of auxiliary this is formerly known,1624620.0,1627079.0
81,as tense mood and aspect we've done,1627080.0,1629119.0
81,episodes about some of these topics and,1629120.0,1630918.0
81,may do episodes but others of them in,1630919.0,1632839.0
81,the future the next most common is for,1632840.0,1634999.0
81,auxiliary verbs is to use in negation,1635000.0,1637939.0
81,which is not quite something we have in,1637940.0,1639739.0
81,English right so in English we have you,1639740.0,1642139.0
81,can make a negation by putting not after,1642140.0,1644418.0
81,an auxiliary or depending on how you,1644419.0,1647359.0
81,sort of want to analyze it you can add,1647360.0,1648918.0
81,to the auxiliary so you can say you know,1648919.0,1651979.0
81,the horse is not eating grass which not,1651980.0,1655339.0
81,is not acting like a verb there I can't,1655340.0,1657678.0
81,say the horse not grass,1657679.0,1660678.0
81,um or I could say the horse isn't eating,1660679.0,1662599.0
81,grass and the int is attaching to the is,1662600.0,1665778.0
81,which is again not a separate auxiliary,1665779.0,1668058.0
81,verb that specifically makes it negation,1668059.0,1670759.0
81,and that's very different to a language,1670760.0,1672199.0
81,like Irish where the negation changes,1672200.0,1676038.0
81,depending on whether it is happening now,1676039.0,1678859.0
81,or happened in the past oh,1678860.0,1681319.0
81,so in the present it is knee and in the,1681320.0,1684079.0
81,past it is neor oh interesting so that's,1684080.0,1686599.0
81,something that English doesn't do and,1686600.0,1688158.0
81,what presented languages do that kind of,1688159.0,1690319.0
81,auxiliary verb for negation it's around,1690320.0,1692599.0
81,20 of languages in the database have,1692600.0,1695298.0
81,that,1695299.0,1696079.0
81,and then the final type of auxiliary use,1696080.0,1698959.0
81,they coded for was like in an English,1698960.0,1701538.0
81,example the grass was eaten by the horse,1701539.0,1704538.0
81,since the horse didn't get its grass,1704539.0,1706459.0
81,before I want to make sure it has had it,1706460.0,1708918.0
81,now,1708919.0,1709879.0
81,um and that passive usage is found in,1709880.0,1711859.0
81,about 10 of languages and the really,1711860.0,1714199.0
81,nice thing about a database like gram,1714200.0,1716298.0
81,bank is that we can click on the map and,1716299.0,1718879.0
81,see that for these passives there's this,1718880.0,1721939.0
81,big chain of languages that spread down,1721940.0,1723918.0
81,through the Europe India Indo-European,1723919.0,1727579.0
81,area and then down into southeast Asia,1727580.0,1729918.0
81,that 10 of languages tend to be focused,1729919.0,1732379.0
81,in that area and there are large parts,1732380.0,1734658.0
81,of the Pacific and Africa and North and,1734659.0,1737058.0
81,South America where there aren't as many,1737059.0,1739459.0
81,languages that do this so we see some,1739460.0,1741558.0
81,kind of common themes among specific,1741559.0,1743959.0
81,languages of certain families or in,1743960.0,1746538.0
81,certain areas that tend to more likely,1746539.0,1749479.0
81,do this and that's one of the really,1749480.0,1750979.0
81,useful benefits of a big database of,1750980.0,1753379.0
81,features like this and and one that's,1753380.0,1755298.0
81,based on a map where you have all these,1755299.0,1756859.0
81,languages as points on a map yeah,1756860.0,1758599.0
81,totally that's really neat and seeing,1758600.0,1760759.0
81,like languages that are related to each,1760760.0,1762499.0
81,other or just languages that have had,1762500.0,1764058.0
81,contact with each other over thousands,1764059.0,1765798.0
81,and thousands of years of history and,1765799.0,1767658.0
81,you know many people have been bilingual,1767659.0,1769278.0
81,and borrowed things from one language to,1769279.0,1770839.0
81,the next and you can see these sort of,1770840.0,1772278.0
81,aerial groupings of different languages,1772279.0,1773959.0
81,so auxiliaries are very neat but clearly,1773960.0,1776778.0
81,they're not a thing that all languages,1776779.0,1778038.0
81,necessarily feel the need to use so if a,1778039.0,1781158.0
81,language isn't using an auxiliary what,1781159.0,1782839.0
81,are some of the things that they could,1782840.0,1783619.0
81,be doing instead gram Bank tends to code,1783620.0,1786499.0
81,things just on a yes or no basis so if,1786500.0,1789678.0
81,it doesn't have it it's just coded as a,1789679.0,1791479.0
81,no but we know there are some other,1791480.0,1792979.0
81,strategies if you're not using an,1792980.0,1794298.0
81,auxiliary that you can use to get the,1794299.0,1796519.0
81,same kind of function right so one,1796520.0,1799699.0
81,obvious idea would be to use a suffix or,1799700.0,1802158.0
81,a prefix so if you wanted to say,1802159.0,1804259.0
81,something like the grass was eaten you,1804260.0,1805759.0
81,could add some sort of ending or some,1805760.0,1807019.0
81,sort of prefix on to eat that would make,1807020.0,1809298.0
81,it passive instead of having the was,1809299.0,1811219.0
81,eaten part make it passive this is a,1811220.0,1813798.0
81,strategy that lots oflanguages do you,1813799.0,1815658.0
81,might have a prefix for negation instead,1815659.0,1818719.0
81,of some strategy that uses an auxiliary,1818720.0,1821178.0
81,and you can also use a different type of,1821179.0,1823278.0
81,word so instead of something being,1823279.0,1825519.0
81,specifically you're recruiting a helping,1825520.0,1828019.0
81,verb that is a verbi to do your meaning,1828020.0,1830719.0
81,you could also have a particle which is,1830720.0,1833719.0
81,a glorious linguistic catch-all term for,1833720.0,1835879.0
81,I don't know it's a word doing something,1835880.0,1840199.0
81,um it's it's not obviously a verb it's,1840200.0,1842239.0
81,not obviously a noun it's just sort of a,1842240.0,1843678.0
81,word that's there and doesn't really,1843679.0,1844819.0
81,change its form like not which I think,1844820.0,1847339.0
81,is a negative particle yeah so something,1847340.0,1849979.0
81,like not is a way of expressing negation,1849980.0,1852859.0
81,rather than changing sort of the end of,1852860.0,1854538.0
81,the word the beginning of the word you,1854539.0,1856158.0
81,can have let's just stick in another,1856159.0,1857599.0
81,word and not I don't think anybody,1857600.0,1859939.0
81,thinks not as a verb in English I don't,1859940.0,1862639.0
81,know but different linguists use,1862640.0,1864079.0
81,different criteria for defining what is,1864080.0,1866119.0
81,a verb and what is a particle so if they,1866120.0,1869119.0
81,have an argument to make for it then,1869120.0,1870918.0
81,it'd be interesting to hear but I think,1870919.0,1873019.0
81,in English you know our sort of standard,1873020.0,1874819.0
81,tests for verb Hood the horse not the,1874820.0,1877459.0
81,Apple doesn't seem like it's actually,1877460.0,1878959.0
81,like a verb there so you could use other,1878960.0,1881599.0
81,words that aren't necessarily verbs to,1881600.0,1884298.0
81,express negation or passives or any of,1884299.0,1886759.0
81,these sort of complicated tensey tiny,1886760.0,1889298.0
81,timeliny things you could say something,1889299.0,1892038.0
81,like the whole habitually eats grass and,1892039.0,1895038.0
81,we have to use habitually there or,1895039.0,1897019.0
81,regularly and it makes you realize just,1897020.0,1898939.0
81,how elegant that aave construction is,1898940.0,1901459.0
81,using habitual B for the horse be eating,1901460.0,1903739.0
81,grass right or I eat already compared to,1903740.0,1906859.0
81,I have eaten the already or the usually,1906860.0,1909499.0
81,or the habitually so sort of adverb,1909500.0,1911719.0
81,things can also sometimes express some,1911720.0,1913699.0
81,of these meanings as well,1913700.0,1915439.0
81,so we've given a lot of love to have as,1915440.0,1918739.0
81,a very common copula we have we have but,1918740.0,1922819.0
81,also B is a very common copula in a,1922820.0,1925278.0
81,bunch of languages we are going to give,1925279.0,1927499.0
81,it some love Basque uses b as a copula,1927500.0,1931579.0
81,oh our isolate language of Europe,1931580.0,1934579.0
81,yes I don't know enough about the,1934580.0,1936918.0
81,history of bath to know whether this is,1936919.0,1938479.0
81,related to contact with a bunch of other,1938480.0,1940519.0
81,Indo-European languages in the sort of,1940520.0,1943099.0
81,Spain France region where Basque is,1943100.0,1945079.0
81,spoken or whether this is something that,1945080.0,1946759.0
81,is passed down from historical,1946760.0,1948678.0
81,protobasque but it does use b as an,1948679.0,1951558.0
81,auxiliary okay so still in the European,1951559.0,1953959.0
81,neighborhood but we don't need to stay,1953960.0,1955999.0
81,in that neighborhood Palestinian aerobic,1956000.0,1957859.0
81,is another language that has been,1957860.0,1958999.0
81,analyzed as using days and auxiliary,1959000.0,1960798.0
81,very nice so we have an example where,1960799.0,1963859.0
81,something like she wrote is done without,1963860.0,1966139.0
81,an auxiliary and then something like she,1966140.0,1968298.0
81,used to write uses B to express that,1968299.0,1971479.0
81,sort of used to meaning used to is,1971480.0,1973519.0
81,another interesting example of an,1973520.0,1974719.0
81,auxiliary in English actually now that,1974720.0,1975918.0
81,we're thinking about it while we're,1975919.0,1977298.0
81,collecting them compared to used two,1977299.0,1979999.0
81,pencils to write,1980000.0,1981918.0
81,yes and then also canande which is a,1981919.0,1985219.0
81,Bantu language uses b as an auxiliary,1985220.0,1989119.0
81,excellent I have a rather violent,1989120.0,1991879.0
81,example here which is we hit recently,1991880.0,1994879.0
81,not today and we are hitting are both,1994880.0,1997339.0
81,forms of the verb that change based on a,1997340.0,1999619.0
81,prefix and then we were recently not,1999620.0,2003158.0
81,today hitting is a form of the verb that,2003159.0,2006579.0
81,uses B to express part of that meaning,2006580.0,2008678.0
81,so all using the same B verb but in,2008679.0,2012278.0
81,slightly different ways and to achieve,2012279.0,2013719.0
81,different grammatical ends exactly and,2013720.0,2016359.0
81,sort of showcasing some of the ranges of,2016360.0,2018219.0
81,examples of different types of meanings,2018220.0,2020558.0
81,whether that's recent past or used to or,2020559.0,2024219.0
81,other types of meanings that can be,2024220.0,2026079.0
81,expressed within auxiliary just,2026080.0,2027639.0
81,depending on what your language is into,2027640.0,2029918.0
81,so while they're not the only verbs that,2029919.0,2032379.0
81,can become auxiliaries haven't be,2032380.0,2034298.0
81,deserve special shout outs for being the,2034299.0,2036639.0
81,workhorses of auxiliaries across many,2036640.0,2039518.0
81,languages yeah we could think of you,2039519.0,2042099.0
81,know auxiliary verbs as you know if you,2042100.0,2045099.0
81,are just a person with a shovel uh with,2045100.0,2048519.0
81,a rake trying to plant some seeds you're,2048520.0,2050918.0
81,going to have a bit more difficulty than,2050919.0,2052539.0
81,if you have a plow where you have a you,2052540.0,2055418.0
81,know a horse that can draw it and help,2055419.0,2057519.0
81,you out with your plowing so you have,2057520.0,2059138.0
81,you know the horse helping you out I,2059139.0,2061719.0
81,think maybe we should think of it as an,2061720.0,2064299.0
81,AUX driven plow instead of an ox-driven,2064300.0,2067239.0
81,plow,2067240.0,2068259.0
81,oh no these words sound exactly the same,2068260.0,2070779.0
81,for me Ox as in Oxen the animal and Ox,2070780.0,2073779.0
81,as in auxiliary is not exactly the same,2073780.0,2075819.0
81,for me this is disappointing where mocks,2075820.0,2078158.0
81,and Orcs are another thing where I don't,2078159.0,2079838.0
81,have a merger I think actually English,2079839.0,2083199.0
81,might be the only language that has the,2083200.0,2085418.0
81,ox Ox merger okay because auxiliary,2085419.0,2089019.0
81,comes from French and so French has,2089020.0,2091539.0
81,oxilier to mean the grammatical thing,2091540.0,2094059.0
81,but then the animal like a male cow is,2094060.0,2097479.0
81,just a buff like a beef okay whereas,2097480.0,2100299.0
81,like German has Ox as in the cow but for,2100300.0,2105399.0
81,the grammatical thing it has hilsverb,2105400.0,2107439.0
81,which just means help verb oh a much,2107440.0,2109719.0
81,more transparent root than uh English,2109720.0,2111939.0
81,borrowing French auxiliary but it does,2111940.0,2114459.0
81,let us make the spectacular joke which,2114460.0,2116979.0
81,is that you can have a an AUX driven,2116980.0,2119679.0
81,verb and there are a few people,2119680.0,2121539.0
81,including friend of the podcast Kirby,2121540.0,2123519.0
81,Conrad who sometimes jocularly pluralize,2123520.0,2126338.0
81,Ox as an auxiliary as oxen like the cow,2126339.0,2129578.0
81,oh I am definitely gonna stop calling,2129579.0,2131439.0
81,them oxen from now on it's a nice,2131440.0,2133419.0

83,"at, I think, eight or ten children. It was a cross-sectional study. As for my PhD, I",701900.0,707869.0
83,worked on a longitudinal study. My main focus at that time was on how these children acquire,707870.0,715328.0
83,"the verb morphology in the language, in this case, the word that indicates action, for",715329.0,720359.0

83,"I'm going to -- so my advisor said, 'Well, you can start with this.' And I said, 'Well,",755420.0,760301.0

83,G: You're not gonna be out of a job. P: It's nice. I think one thing that I really,779120.0,784859.0
83,appreciate is the opportunity that I have also in documenting acquisition for Mayan,784860.0,790179.0
83,"languages. For example, I have documented the acquisition of Chuj, another written Mayan",790180.0,794789.0
83,"language to Q'anjob'al, for example. By looking into a known language, it helps me",794790.0,798919.0
83,"to understand what must be going on in Q'anjob'al. And I said, 'Wow! I wish I had access to",798920.0,803979.0

83,"G: You can find some things that are similar between Chuj and Q'anjob'al, and some",809290.0,812510.0
83,"things that are different, because the languages are grammatically, you know, related. They're",812511.0,815719.0

83,"in terms of understanding what's going on, in terms of explaining a specific phenomenon,",818040.0,822869.0
83,"for example. It really helps to have that kind of mirror, for example, to see what's",822870.0,827778.0
83,going on. G: One thing that I know about when kids are,827779.0,830369.0
83,acquiring English is they often make mistakes. They'll say things like 'runned' instead,830370.0,834879.0
83,"of 'ran' or something like that. This tells you 'Oh, they're generalising something",834880.0,838739.0
83,about a rule.' Are there some things that come up with mistakes kids make or interesting,838740.0,842518.0
83,things that kids do when they're acquiring --,842519.0,844208.0
83,"P: That's an interesting question. That's something I was looking at, for example, for",844209.0,848208.0
83,"Chuj and for Q'anjob'al is that, so in Mayan languages, for example, there is this",848209.0,855039.0
83,suffix that is known as the 'status suffix' that appears after a verb. The idea of this,855040.0,862359.0
83,"status of something, like, it's indicating what information is provided by the verb.",862360.0,870359.0
83,G: 'Style' suffix? P: 'Status.' 'Status suffix.' It indicates,870360.0,876859.0
83,"whether the verb is a transitive verb or an intransitive verb. In this case, when we talk",876860.0,882518.0
83,"about intransitive verbs, it's one participant of the verb. Transitive verb -- two participants.",882519.0,887659.0
83,"G: So, if you have something like 'walk,' it's gonna be intransitive, and it's gonna",887660.0,892181.0
83,"have one status suffix. If you have something like, well, the classic example is 'hit,'",892182.0,896759.0
83,"but I always find that very violent -- you know, 'hug' or something -- that's",896760.0,900169.0
83,gonna be transitive. And it's gonna have a different suffix.,900170.0,903499.0
83,"P: A different -- yeah. In English, for example, that's just one form of the verb. But in",903500.0,908229.0
83,"Mayan languages, or someplace, you have a specific morphology on the verb to indicate",908230.0,912299.0
83,"that, well, you are talking about an intransitive verb or a transitive verb.",912300.0,915169.0
83,"G: So, if it's just 'I eat,' it's gonna have one status suffix. If it's 'I",915170.0,918739.0
83,"eat an apple,' it's gonna have a different status suffix to indicate that that's there.",918740.0,921789.0
83,"Okay. P: I think, trying to answer your question,",921790.0,923539.0
83,"that all of this -- I mean, there are all things that happen with this status suffix,",923540.0,927369.0
83,"but I haven't seen children, for example, producing errors with these status suffixes.",927370.0,934129.0
83,One thing that we have seen as maybe 'errors' or children overgeneralising is the production,934130.0,942449.0
83,of the status suffixes in a specific position. One thing that we know about status suffixes,942450.0,948028.0
83,"is that sometimes they appear at the end of a verb, and other times, they don't. But",948029.0,955109.0
83,"in other times, they do. Then the question is, 'What happened?'",955110.0,958559.0
83,"G: And adults know this? P: An adult knows. But for a child, there",958560.0,962619.0
83,are different variations on these status suffixes that a child has to find as a challenge. One,962620.0,968389.0
83,"thing that we notice is that these children, for example, produce these suffixes in non-final",968390.0,973439.0
83,position -- something that is not seen -- G: The adults only produce it at the end of,973440.0,977319.0
83,"the verb, at the end of the sentence? P: Yes and no. If they have what we call a",977320.0,983599.0
83,'root verb' -- consonant-vowel-consonant is the idea.,983600.0,985909.0
83,"G: Consonant-vowel-consonant is a 'root verb,' okay.",985910.0,988189.0
83,"P: When you have that verb with that 'shape,' let's say, that suffix doesn't appear",988190.0,993148.0
83,"in the non-final position. But if you have something that is, let's say, derived, then",993149.0,999219.0
83,that suffix has to be there. G: Okay. If you make the verb into something,999220.0,1003179.0
83,else by changing the tense or something -- P: By changing the status of that word. You,1003180.0,1007679.0
83,"have the word 'song,' for example, and then you make the verb 'to sing,' then",1007680.0,1013159.0
83,you add a morpheme to it so that this noun 'song' becomes an intransitive. Because,1013160.0,1018500.0
83,"of that, then it's a derived intransitive verb.",1018501.0,1020698.0
83,"G: It's a derived intransitive, and you need to have the suffix. Do the kids do this?",1020699.0,1024399.0
83,P: They produce that. One thing that we noticed is that they make that difference between,1024400.0,1029249.0
83,"derived and non-derived intransitive verbs. Again, it's like they are acquiring that,",1029250.0,1036289.0
83,but that's what we see as something problematic for them in acquiring those status suffixes.,1036290.0,1041979.0
83,"G: They have some difficulties still. P: That's, I would say, where we see them",1041980.0,1047239.0
83,making those mistakes or having trouble with acquiring the suffixes.,1047240.0,1053019.0
83,G: Is there something that you've noticed that's interesting about how kids are acquiring,1053020.0,1056538.0
83,"the languages you've worked on? P: In addition to looking at the verb morphology,",1056539.0,1061548.0
83,I also studied how children acquire the nominal classifier -- numeral classifier -- in Q'anjob'al.,1061549.0,1067759.0
83,"In this case, some Mayan languages have a nominal classifier or a numeral classifier.",1067760.0,1071999.0
83,"In this language, for example, everything has to be classified. If you refer to a woman,",1072000.0,1076908.0
83,"for example, you're going to use the classifier 'ix,' and then 'naq,' for example,",1076909.0,1083089.0
83,for men. Then if you have other things like --,1083090.0,1086769.0
83,"G: You know, a hat or something. P: Then it would be 'chʼen,' for example.",1086770.0,1091199.0
83,"G: That's for objects in general, or are there several different kinds of objects?",1091200.0,1094499.0
83,"P: Well, for animals, for people, for objects, and things like that.",1094500.0,1098949.0
83,"G: So, if you have a dog or something? P: That's going to be different. That's",1098950.0,1102408.0
83,"going to be 'no'.' I was interacting with this child. He was a boy. Well, first,",1102409.0,1107439.0
83,he was interacting with his grandmother. These classifiers were there. He was like 'ix',1107440.0,1112779.0
83,or 'naq' or 'chem' or 'ch'en' or 'no'' -- everything that was --,1112780.0,1116859.0
83,G: Everything that you would expect for all the different kinds of things that you can,1116860.0,1119989.0
83,refer to. P: And then someone came to visit grandma.,1119990.0,1123149.0
83,"So, grandma left the conversation, so that left just the boy and myself. This is what",1123150.0,1130719.0
83,"happened. All of those classifiers were gone. There's just one that stayed, which is 'ix.'",1130720.0,1136229.0
83,"G: So, he's using 'ix' for everything. P: 'Ix' for everything. But this is not",1136230.0,1139609.0
83,something that he's just making up. It's something that we can see in the other grammar.,1139610.0,1144418.0
83,"G: Okay. Do other children do this as well? P: Other children do, but mainly boys -- not",1144419.0,1149239.0
83,girls. G: Interesting.,1149240.0,1150619.0
83,P: The thing is that this 'ix' that replaces all nominal classifiers occurs mainly among,1150620.0,1156779.0
83,men. People have argued that it's mostly in informal contexts.,1156780.0,1162729.0
83,"G: Right. So, because his grandma is gone, and you two are men together -- well, he's",1162730.0,1166999.0

83,G: 'With this guy.' Even at this young age.,1178610.0,1180979.0
83,P: Exactly. He was about 2-and-a-half or 3 years old. This boy is able to distinguish,1180980.0,1187558.0
83,"both contexts. His grandma has come back in the conversation, and then those classifiers",1187559.0,1193928.0
83,came back. G: Wow. He's really paying attention to,1193929.0,1197009.0
83,this dynamic situation of whether his grandma is here or not changing how he talks.,1197010.0,1202019.0
83,"P: When to use all the classifiers and when to use just one classifier. For me, again,",1202020.0,1207479.0
83,"that's a way to illustrate that these children, they're exposed to the language, and they",1207480.0,1212729.0
83,"are exposed to this system of the nominal classifier, but in addition to that information,",1212730.0,1217649.0
83,the social aspect of that nominal -- G: And the cultural context where if you just,1217650.0,1221899.0
83,had kids who are trying to learn language in a classroom while maybe the teacher is,1221900.0,1225309.0
83,"a woman, and you don't have all the different types of social situations.",1225310.0,1228949.0
83,"P: One of the things that's important to emphasise, then, when we do language documentation",1228950.0,1233519.0
83,"is making sure that that interaction with that child doesn't happen only with grandma,",1233520.0,1240059.0

83,and also -- G: Ages.,1245520.0,1246798.0
83,P: And there's ages and the kids themselves. G: Because maybe the kids are talking differently,1246799.0,1251629.0
83,with each other than they're talking with their grandparents or their aunts and uncles,1251630.0,1254999.0
83,or the older generation. The researcher doesn't necessarily know in advance which things the,1255000.0,1258769.0

83,the men until they're older. You don't know what age they learn that until you're,1262500.0,1266168.0
83,studying it. P: Exactly. I would say the take home message,1266169.0,1268969.0
83,"in this part of the conversation is documenting everything, basically, because you never know,",1268970.0,1274158.0

83,"are discussing for the 'ix,' I think it's a unique illustration of the importance of",1327130.0,1331879.0
83,"documenting the language as a whole. G: In the whole community, cultural context.",1331880.0,1337019.0

83,"in the background or something.' P: Again, that's the advantage and disadvantage",1346000.0,1348759.0
83,"of doing this kind of work. I think it's good to do both, especially when we talk about",1348760.0,1351819.0
83,"Indigenous languages. You mentioned something important, 'Okay, what do we know, for example,",1351820.0,1357699.0
83,about language acquisition?' I think most of that information comes from the well-known,1357700.0,1362778.0
83,languages. What happens to these less studied languages or languages that haven't been,1362779.0,1368939.0
83,"studied at all, for example -- how to bring those languages into discussing what we learn",1368940.0,1377309.0
83,about language acquisition? G: And there's two reasons why that's,1377310.0,1380659.0
83,"really important. One is because, for speakers of those languages, if they want to try to",1380660.0,1385178.0
83,support using them in schools or using them in daily life or trying to revitalise a language,1385179.0,1390668.0
83,"that's become less common in daily life, having the knowledge of 'How do kids talk",1390669.0,1394528.0
83,in this language? What are their first words like? How do adults normally talk to children,1394529.0,1399159.0
83,in a bit of a different style?' P: I think we can say that it's not just,1399160.0,1402659.0
83,"about the grammatical aspect of the language that these kids are acquiring, but at the",1402660.0,1406918.0
83,"same time, how they are acquiring that language, for example. I think one thing that it would",1406919.0,1412979.0
83,"be good to connect with language revitalisation is, like, let's learn the language thinking",1412980.0,1418599.0
83,"like we are kids. Because a kid, for example, wouldn't think about 'Oh, is this the",1418600.0,1423349.0
83,way to say it?' 'Should I put this here?' G: 'Should I put this suffix on this verb?',1423350.0,1426689.0
83,P: Exactly. G: Kids don't know what a suffix is.,1426690.0,1429469.0
83,"P: And it takes time for them to get to the production of the adult level. For instance,",1429470.0,1435999.0
83,"also the sound system that these children produce. Q'anjob'al, for example, has",1436000.0,1441739.0
83,"retroflex sounds like /ʈʂʰ/ or /ʈʂʼ/, for example, /ʂ/. And these kids do not produce",1441740.0,1448509.0
83,them like -- G: They can't produce them immediately.,1448510.0,1450678.0
83,"P: No, no, no. It takes time for them. I will say three-years-and-a-half or four. It takes",1450679.0,1457379.0
83,"that time to produce this retroflex. I think when we are in the context of revitalisation,",1457380.0,1465459.0
83,those learners of a language will go through similar patterns of acquisition.,1465460.0,1469239.0
83,G: If you're trying to re-learn Q'anjob'al as an adult and being stressed that you can't,1469240.0,1474899.0
83,"produce the retroflex and say, 'Look, it takes the kids four years. If it takes you",1474900.0,1477959.0
83,"four years, that's really normal. You can keep practicing this and get better at it.",1477960.0,1481809.0
83,"If you can't do it on the first day, then you still have hope.'",1481810.0,1484769.0
83,P: That's the importance of doing this kind of project and documenting how children acquire,1484770.0,1490829.0
83,this kind of language. Then this information can be useful for other purposes.,1490830.0,1495099.0
83,"G: Q'anjob'al also has the ejectives, which I'm not doing a very good job of pronouncing,",1495100.0,1499619.0
83,but you've been saying it in the name of the language itself that 'Q'anjob'al.',1499620.0,1502418.0
83,"P: /qʼanxobal/, yes. G: Do kids learn those really early, or are",1502419.0,1505519.0
83,they a bit harder? P: It takes time for them as well. That's,1505520.0,1508538.0
83,"another interesting question because what we have noticed is that these children, when",1508539.0,1512229.0
83,"they try to produce these ejectives, they would follow two strategies. One -- either",1512230.0,1518889.0
83,they produce the plain consonant. G: So /kanxobal/ instead of /qʼanxobal/?,1518890.0,1523699.0
83,P: Exactly. Or they would just produce the glottal stop.,1523700.0,1527908.0
83,"G: Oh, okay, so /ʔnxobal/? P: Or something like /ʔanxobal/, but I'm",1527909.0,1532109.0
83,just making this up. It will be something like this -- either they use a plain or this,1532110.0,1538599.0
83,glottal stop. It's a process. G: Extracting the two possible features that,1538600.0,1544259.0
83,you would need to put together eventually. P: This has been reported for the acquisition,1544260.0,1548209.0
83,"of sounds in K'iche' and Chuj, and I also see it in Q'anjob'al.",1548210.0,1552159.0
83,G: These are all Mayan languages that have --,1552160.0,1553648.0
83,"P: Mayan languages that have ejectives as well. Maybe someone will say, 'This is our",1553649.0,1557538.0
83,"dialectal variation,' or 'It's just the kids,' I mean, because of individual",1557539.0,1562059.0
83,"differences, but no, it's across -- G: It's across a bunch of them. That gets",1562060.0,1566179.0
83,us to the other reason why it's really important to document kids acquiring lots of different,1566180.0,1569989.0
83,"languages -- Indigenous languages -- is that, when we're trying to think, 'What",1569990.0,1572919.0
83,do we think about how kids learn language in general?' if we base those theories entirely,1572920.0,1577019.0
83,on a few big languages that have other relatively similar typological features in some cases,1577020.0,1581869.0
83,"-- English and Spanish are typologically related, and so if you're coming up with",1581870.0,1585139.0
83,"a theory just based on English and Spanish, well, you know, that's not very generalisable.",1585140.0,1588519.0
83,P: That's true. I think that's one of the other things that we wanted to mention,1588520.0,1592908.0
83,"here, like how to include other languages to understand human language and also how",1592909.0,1598219.0
83,"these children acquire languages -- human languages in the world, you mentioned, that",1598220.0,1604679.0
83,sometimes haven't been explored at all. It would be good to document those languages,1604680.0,1608538.0
83,and have a better idea of what these kids do. But the other thing that I'm going to,1608539.0,1614759.0
83,"add here is that, yeah, we want to have a better idea of how these children acquire",1614760.0,1618319.0
83,"language, but at the same time, how this information can be used, again, for language revitalisation",1618320.0,1624979.0
83,or for language maintenance or things that the community's interested in. One thing,1624980.0,1629449.0
83,"that I noticed, for example, about this in Q'anjob'al is that these children, their",1629450.0,1633209.0
83,"first words have a basic shape which is consonant-vowel-consonant. This is really common in the whole Mayan languages,",1633210.0,1641669.0
83,"but these are the specific things that these children produce. If that's the case, then",1641670.0,1646569.0
83,is this information possible to use when we consider creating teaching materials for these,1646570.0,1651989.0
83,children? It would be a good thing to have this because it's going to be much easier,1651990.0,1656349.0
83,"if these children can read these words with this shape, for example.",1656350.0,1660149.0
83,"G: Right. If you know what words they're acquiring early, then you can say, 'Oh,",1660150.0,1663699.0
83,"well, we'll put those words in maybe the first books that we're trying to have them",1663700.0,1666879.0
83,learn because you don't wanna try to have them read a book with words that they don't,1666880.0,1669999.0
83,"understand, they're not using already. You can use this small shape -- because Mayan",1670000.0,1673918.0
83,"languages have, you know, quite a bit of prefixes and suffixes and things on the words but,",1673919.0,1678369.0
83,"of course, you have to start somewhere, and that's just with -- the roots are generally",1678370.0,1682139.0
83,"consonant-vowel-consonant, so they just produce the root first, and then they start adding",1682140.0,1686979.0
83,things onto it. P: Exactly. They are good at identifying those,1686980.0,1690949.0
83,"roots in the input or in the adult grammar in this case, yeah. Also, I had the opportunity",1690950.0,1695639.0
83,to collaborate with other people about trying to understand how these pieces are put in,1695640.0,1701639.0
83,"the verb. What we have noticed is that there's the root, and then children are good at producing",1701640.0,1707869.0
83,suffixes. G: Ah. But not prefixes?,1707870.0,1709859.0
83,"P: Not prefixes, but for a reason. G: What's that?",1709860.0,1713579.0
83,P: Stress. G: Oh.,1713580.0,1715279.0
83,P: Stress is also with these suffixes. You have the root and then the suffix.,1715280.0,1722499.0
83,"G: And that's the part they do first, and then they do the prefixes much later.",1722500.0,1726219.0
83,"P: Yeah, later. G: Interesting.",1726220.0,1728839.0
83,"P: That's the other thing that we have. G: So, you work at the University of Toronto",1728840.0,1734689.0
83,now. P: Yes.,1734690.0,1736649.0
83,G: What sorts of projects are you working on there?,1736650.0,1739518.0

83,that has been considered an endangered language because it has less than 40 speakers.,1758590.0,1765949.0
83,G: Wow. Less than 40. P: And most of them are elders. I think this,1765950.0,1770268.0
83,"week I was asked about how old is the youngest, and I said, 'Well, 70-something.' Children",1770269.0,1777658.0
83,are not acquiring that language anymore. But the goal in this project is how to teach the,1777659.0,1785558.0
83,language and how to bring the language back. That's one of the projects that I am doing,1785559.0,1789889.0

83,1.) is developing a workshop on teaching them how to teach the language.,1794100.0,1798558.0
83,G: Right. Because just because you can speak a language doesn't mean you know how to,1798559.0,1801699.0
83,teach it. P: That's one of the things that we did.,1801700.0,1803289.0
83,"What would be the best method? We're using a method that has been used in other contexts,",1803290.0,1810009.0
83,"so let's try to use this for the revitalisation of Itza', in this case, not for all Mayan",1810010.0,1815959.0
83,"languages, but for Itza' because of the condition of it.",1815960.0,1818659.0
83,G: Because Q'anjob'al still has lots of speakers.,1818660.0,1821089.0
83,"P: Lots of speakers, yeah, so it's different from Itza'. So, that's one thing. The",1821090.0,1825489.0
83,other thing we are doing -- and for me this is really important because we are developing,1825490.0,1831298.0
83,"pedagogical material that we are using for the same purpose, but the unique thing for",1831299.0,1838408.0

83,"you are learning this. You're doing your research. But at the same time, this is the",1909010.0,1913879.0

83,"yes, we have to do language revitalisation, but I think there's another component that",2099910.0,2104629.0
83,we have to consider that's about the research aspect of that. One thing that I noticed about,2104630.0,2110989.0

83,this project. I could mention two. One of them is that we have trained some speakers,2143599.0,2149078.0
83,of the language about the teaching method. They are using this method to teach the language.,2149079.0,2154659.0
83,We are about to finish up this pedagogical grammar for the language. I think those can,2154660.0,2161539.0

84,pointing back in that direction. Is there research on pointing with various parts of the body?,371520.0,375959.0
84,L: Absolutely. We talk about pointing with the finger and particularly the index finger as the,375960.0,382499.0
84,most common. When we were pointing -- that you couldn't see at the top of the episode -- that,382500.0,386999.0

84,"maybe like a group of trees or somewhere far away, we might use an open hand rather than",405540.0,409739.0

84,"L: I mean, yeah. I think maybe it is. G: I find this a fun and interesting way",2034060.0,2039639.0
84,of thinking about meaning because the way that I think we're sometimes introduced to meaning,2039640.0,2045039.0
