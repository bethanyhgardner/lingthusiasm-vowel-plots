1,1,Lauren,Welcome to Lingthusiasm! A podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics. I'm Lauren Gawne.
1,2,Gretchen,And I'm Gretchen McCulloch. And today we're going to be talking about universal language and why it doesn't work. But first a little bit about what Lingthusiasm is.
1,3,Lauren,So I guess the important thing is to unpack 'a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics'.
1,4,Gretchen,Yeah! We chose our tagline because we're here to explore interesting things that language has to offer and especially what looking at language from a linguistics perspective can tell us about how language works.
1,5,Lauren,"Both of us have blogs where we do a fair amount of that, but that's a fairly solitary enterprise and we wanted to take the opportunity to have more of a conversation -- something that's a little less disembodied"
1,6,Gretchen,"And we like that podcasts make you feel like part of a conversation. There's a certain genre of linguist conversation that we think non-linguists don't get to listen in on enough, where we just are very excited about all the things that happened in linguistics."
1,7,Lauren,And there's a general kind of nerdy enthusiasm that you can often get like a glimpse of this when linguists do interviews. But the chance to have a chat to another linguist -- it's something that we get to do often over coffee but we know people don't always get to hear that perspective and so that's what this podcast is all about.
1,8,Gretchen,"Yeah, so you can think of it as our sitting down over coffee and talking about linguistics. [Music]"
1,9,Gretchen,"One thing that often comes up when we're talking about languages and linguistics is, 'Wouldn't it be great if everyone just spoke one language?' And there's two things that come with that: there's the idea that could be feasible to make everybody speak one language and if so what should that language be? And secondly is the promise that we associate with it -- what it would even mean for everyone to speak the language even if that is feasible? So we're going to kind of break down those two pieces of the wish for everyone to speak one language. What would that look like and would it even work the way it's advertised?"
1,10,Lauren,"And it seems to be an idea that people continue to revisit, and revisit in different forms, and different ideas, and we're going to touch on a few of today. But it's always this allure of something utopian or easier -- if everyone just spoke the same language then then there'd be world peace because we'd all just get along."
1,11,Gretchen,"Yes! So, preview: I'm not a fan of it. I'm on the record as having called it the 'common language equals peace fallacy' and I think it's the seductive allure of like 'wouldn't be greater if everyone just got along?' Like the kind of Miss Universe wishing for world peace thing. I don't know that's the analogy I want, but yeah i'm not a fan of it. I think we're going to see why."
1,12,Lauren,This is definitely not a debate style set up today either. I should happily say that I agree and I'm perhaps more realistic about the realities of humanity when it comes to an idealistic concept like this.
1,13,Gretchen,it has given rise to some interesting stuff! So let's use it as an opportunity to talk about some of the interesting stuff that the wish for a common language has given us.
1,14,Lauren,"okay, definitely."
1,15,Gretchen,"one of the best-known endeavors to get everyone to speak a common language and lead to peace on Earth is Esperanto. And Esperanto is interesting because it's a conlang. So it was constructed to be a sort of neutral language that would supposedly be easy to learn and not reflective of any particular nationality, because it was created to be this independent things which wasn't like learning a language associated with a particular country. The idea being that everyone can understand each other and living in peace and harmony. And there's a couple of issues with different parts of this. For one, Esperanto is not totally neutral. It borrows a lot of words from various European languages and so it's a lot easier to learn for people who already speak a European language than for people who speak a language that's not European. So it's not easy for everyone to learn, it's easy for a particular group of people to learn."
1,16,Lauren,So I've seen bits of Esperanto and I immediately think of French that's being fed through some kind of Italian filter and then Spanish-ified. It definitely has a strong Romance language kind of vibe to it.
1,17,Gretchen,it has a Romance kind of look because it tends to have this kind of consonant vowel sequences like Romance languages do. But actually it also does have a lot of words from Slavic languages and from Germanic languages as well. So like the Esperanto word for dog is something like 'hundo' which is a Germanic word like 'hound' -- it's not something like 'chien' or something like that.
1,18,Lauren,the only Esperanto word I know is the word 'hotdogo' which is the Esperanto word for hotdog. It's not 'hot hundo' or whatever it is -- 'hotdogo' is my one piece of Esperanto.
1,19,Gretchen,"but the Esperanto word that I remember the best is 'kai' K-A-I, which is the word for 'and'."
1,20,Lauren,yeah
1,21,Gretchen,"so again you can see that's not very, Romance sounding because it's not 'et' or some vowel-y thing and it's not even Germanic because it's not 'and' or 'und'. 'Kai' is actually from Greek. Zamenhof, who's the guy who created Esperanto, did try to draw on multiple languages so 'kai' comes from Greek. I guess my personal story with Esperanto is I tried learning it when I was like 12."
1,22,Lauren,I am so not surprised.
1,23,Gretchen,"because I was that kid. I tried learning it when I was like 12 because I encountered this book about it on a bookshelf. This was back before i was really using the internet very much and I encountered a paperback book about Esperanto and I was like 'oh yeah I'm going to read this because I'd like to see someone like you know putting out the arguments for and against.' And it turned out it was not a pros and cons book it was literally a grammar or like a 'teach yourself Esperanto' book so I was like 'okay, fine' i can't read the pros and cons maybe I'll just learn it."
1,24,Lauren,impeccable logic.
1,25,Gretchen,this is what 12 year old Gretchen did when she was encountering a language. And so I got through chapter 1 which is how i learned the word for 'and' and 'dog' and then I got to chapter 2 and I learned that all of the feminine forms were diminutive of the masculine forms.
1,26,Lauren,ugh
1,27,Gretchen,so the word for men is like 'homo' or something like Homo sapiens. And then the word for woman is 'homino' (
1,28,Lauren,"boo) which is '-in' like the German -in suffix. Like in German you have Sprachwissenschaftler which is a linguist, i.e. speech scientist and you have Sprachwissenschaftlerin which is a female speech scientist."
1,29,Lauren,I'm all ready to blow things up. So much for a language of peace.
1,30,Gretchen,"yeah so first of all maybe this language is peaceful but it's going to be a sexist peace so I'm not sure if I'm into it. In fact, I know I'm not into it."
1,31,Lauren,"yeah, fair enough."
1,32,Gretchen,"and secondly this just seems uneconomical. Because as anybody who has spoken Spanish or something knows, sometimes you really do want to be able to distinguish between a group that's gender mixed or gender neutral and a group that is specifically only a plural of males. So in Spanish you have a word like 'niño' which can mean 'boy' or 'child' whereas 'niña' means 'girl' -- but 'niños' can mean either 'boys' or 'children' so you have to do like extra stuff you want to talk about a group of boys specifically. So it's kind of uneconomical from a linguistic perspective to have your neutral word and your masculine word be the same word. Because this is genuinely a semantic distinction that's useful to be able to make and Esperanto just can't do it."
1,33,Lauren,right
1,34,Gretchen,"so it's a terrible language for a bunch of reasons and the the main reason that I stopped when I was 12, which I think was a great decision on my part, was that it was sexist."
1,35,Lauren,So Zamenhof was like a complete idealist.
1,36,Gretchen,he was a big idealist. The name Esperanto itself means 'one who hopes' and this was his pseudonym -- Dr. Esperanto. So he was really hoping for kind of world peace and world understanding which is very nice. I think maybe because of his political ideals -- that was really why people did manage to learn Esperanto. And it is one of the more successful common languages -- according to Wikipedia up to two million people worldwide to varying degrees speak Esperanto.
1,37,Lauren,but is that just people like me who go 'hotdogs! yes!'?
1,38,Gretchen,"yeah, so I don't know if you and I count because we know a few words of Esperanto, or if you have to be like a more dedicated enthusiasts. Some people have raised their children speaking Esperanto -- so as far as common languages go, it's had some success. But I've also heard that as a conlang it's not considered a very good conlang. So if you talk to conlangers, and I know a few conlangers, there is the kind of 'everyone's first conlang' which is pseudo-European everything combined, that still inherits a lot of the illogicalities of European languages. That's what this is. So that's like a stage 1 conlang and then a stage 2 conlang is when you learn about all the other stuff other languages do and you try to make a language that does all of them."
1,39,Lauren,it has 48 cases and clicks and evidentials...
1,40,Gretchen,"yeah, and ergativity and it just does every single weird thing you can imagine from a language -- like too many of them, so it's ridiculously complex. And then by the time you get to your third conlang you've learned the value of restraint and you can really make a good conlang. This is what I've been told. So apparently Esperanto has all of the marks of a first conlang."
1,41,Lauren,"The story I like the most about Esperanto, and its optimistic naivety, was that there were a whole bunch of people in commerce who were like 'Esperanto. Great idea. Universal language. Just tone down the optimism of world peace because it would be really great as like a commercial thing if we could have international trade through this unified language""."
1,42,Gretchen,so world capitalism instead of world peace.
1,43,Lauren,basically. And they got so fed up they broke off and created this language called 'Ido' which I think means like 'daughter' or 'child' language -- and then basically it fell apart because they failed to maintain the drive
1,44,Gretchen,they were insufficiently peaceful.
1,45,Lauren,they were insufficiently peaceful. Maybe there is a kernel there -- Esperanto selling itself is the universal language of peace seems to have done a lot for its longevity.
1,46,Gretchen,"I kind of think of Esperanto and people who learn Esperanto is kind of like couch surfers -- you know, people who joined like the couch surfing web site and they meet people from around the world and they like sleep on each other's couches and they really do like having experiences that are like connected to the local community -- and I think that's very nice, it's just a pity that they're doing it with such a terrible language."
1,47,Lauren,"Another language with someone tried to capture this idea of universal communication but from a completely different perspective was Blissymbols or Blissymbolics -- which were invented by a guy his name was Charles Bliss. But this was a name he gave himself because he was Carl Blitz and that didn't go down so well. He was Jewish and was interned in the Nazi camps. After he escaped the war, he moved to Shanghai he changed his name to 'Bliss' because 'Blitz' wasn't the the best for a former German prisoner."
1,48,Gretchen,was he also emphasizing this hope aspect.
1,49,Lauren,well i think it was part of this bigger personal brand that he had as this cheerful guy who was going to solve the world's communications problems through a language -- that was all about visual iconic imagery. He started learning Chinese and was like 'oh the character for 'man' in Chinese characters looks like a man I'll just take this to the full language' and he and his wife spent all of his savings (which is kind of a reoccurring story that seems to go with Conlangs). He and his wife ploughed all their savings into him inventing these Blissymbols as an international ideographic written language. They sent out copies of the book all over the world thinking -- this is the 1940s-1950 -- that he was going to revolutionize the way people connected and communicated and no one took it up.
1,50,Gretchen,"yeah i remember reading about listen about Blissymbolics a couple years ago when I read Arika Okrent's book The Land of Invented Languages, but I think you just read that book right?"
1,51,Lauren,"yep, and its really great."
1,52,Gretchen,"I really enjoyed it, and I forgotten now most of what she says about Blissymbolics -- but he tried to do this and there were a couple kind of tiny areas where he saw uptake right?"
1,53,Lauren,"yeah, so the idea went nowhere -- and then in the seventies Shirley McNaughton in Canada who worked with children who had either physical or cognitive disabilities found these symbols for her students to use to communicate.Until that point all the children had with this board full of symbols for 'toilet' or 'bed' -- really basic needs-based communication. And she was convinced that these children could communicate more, but their cerebral palsy would prevent them from speaking. So she set out the Blissymbols and used them as a way to teach these children to communicate. So she'd have the symbol for a person and the symbol for bed and then the symbol for photo or something and and the children were able to say, like, 'I had a dream last night about this thing...' -- people who'd never been able to communicate before. And it really took off in the organization where she was working in Canada. And then it started spreading, after sitting on a shelf for decades unused you finally have someone using them to communicate with people who couldn't communicate before, it was really powerful. And then Charles Bliss was still alive and there's just no way to tell story -- I mean Arika Okrent does tell the story really beautifully, but I just can't tell in a way where Charles Bliss doesn't sound like a jerk. But he kind of came into this situation and said 'you can't teach the kids to use the symbols like this' because she was using English grammar whereas in Sweden they were using them with the children to move on to Swedish, so they were using them with Swedish word order. And everywhere else they were bringing in variation to how the symbols were used, as a way to go from not communicating at all, to communicating with Blissymbols, to communicating with words in the kids' languages. Bliss said 'you're ruining the universality of these symbols'."
1,54,Gretchen,"Like, so much for helping children. No we can't do that."
1,55,Lauren,"No, we can't help the children. We need to maintain the 'authenticity' of these Blissymbols."
1,56,Gretchen,yeah this guy really seems like a jerk.
1,57,Lauren,"in the end they ended up settling for an absolute mass of money for him to give them the rights to use Blissymbols. It was just horrible that you would go from being like 'I'm all about communication and encouraging people to communicate"" to 'you're not using my invention properly so give me lots of money'."
1,58,Gretchen,"yeah the other thing I think is, because, I mean it's not like Blissymbols had caught on elsewhere ("
1,59,Lauren,"nope), and I think that kind of speaks to this hope. This kind of seductive hope, especially when it comes to visual communication, even beyond auditory communication, that if only we could just like get the right graphic designer we could just think this through. We could figure out ways to intuitively represent every single possible meaning in an immediately obvious sequence of little pictures that all humans will understand instantly and you won't have to learn anything. I get this when it comes to emoji a lot, because I do a lot of emoji interviews and some people say 'oh yeah emoji they're this universal language that you can understand immediately' -- and I think it's a similar problem that there's a lot in emoji that is culturally specific, or that is not universally understandable, and there's also a lot of meanings you can't convey an emoji because they aren't very easily picture-able."
1,60,Lauren,"it's like those times that people are like 'this thing got translated into emoji' and you're like 'great, translate it back out of emoji why don't you?'"
1,61,Gretchen,"yeah, you translate something into emoji and then when you translate it back it completely loses its meaning, or you have to already understand what the source text was. The other thing is people sometimes have a challenge where they'll communicate just in emoji for a day or a week or a month or something, and they all come back and they're like 'yeah you know it was pretty easy to convey if I was happy or sad but it was really hard to say actual sentences about things going on in the world or ideas that I had'. My favorite one is someone tried to do this and they said at the end 'I was missing grammar'. I said 'thank you', because that's what emoji don't have."
1,62,Lauren,or sometimes you find that people do -- you find temporary emergent communicative norms that will arise in these contexts where people are trying to use things.
1,63,Gretchen,"yeah, so for example, one of the issues that comes up with emoji is how do you convey 'I' as in the subject of a sentence? you know 'I would like you to do this"" or 'I'm going to the store now'. What people will sometimes do is they'll pick an emoji like a person emoji that looks kind of like them and they will say 'okay great, this one stands for me' you know. So they'll pick the man or the woman, they'll put the skin tone modifier on it and like 'okay, that stands for me'. But the only reason that the other person knows you're using that to stand for you is because you've developed this convention. Otherwise it could be a person who looks kinda like this who is not necessarily me who does this action. And this is a pretty basic concept that we just have a massive difficulty communicating with emoji."
1,64,Lauren,"and we also are really -- I mean we're not lazy, we just use the linguistic structures that we have. Of course it's 'person' and then 'bus' because English is 'I am on the bus'."
1,65,Gretchen,"right, but in other languages you can have like 'bus, I am on it' or something like that."
1,66,Lauren,"I enjoy whenever anyone's like 'look we made sentences in emoji', I love sitting there and like translating them really badly."
1,67,Gretchen,"yeah, I issued a challenge on Twitter a while back which was: if you want to assert that emoji are language that's fine you just have to do that in emoji."
1,68,Lauren,oh snap.
1,69,Gretchen,"yeah, and you have to make someone who doesn't know that's what you're intending be able to read that sentence. Because any language that we have, you know, even Esperanto, I don't know maybe even Blissymbolics, can assert that it's a language. Like there's a way to say in Esperanto 'Esperanto is a language'."
1,70,Lauren,yeah
1,71,Gretchen,"and so I got all these responses and read them and I was having a lot of fun providing naive interpretations of them something like 'I get happy when I sing the alphabet song', you know?'"
1,72,Lauren,so not that successful so far...
1,73,Gretchen,"not that successful so far, and I don't think it's for lack of creativity! I think it's because that's not what emoji are designed to communicate. That's not what obvious pictures are designed to communicate. There's a limit to how much meaning can be obvious because we have all these abstract things that we mean and lots of stuff that we talk about is not picture-able."
1,74,Lauren,"I get this a lot as well when I talk to people about gesture, and people are like 'ah gestures are the great universal thing that humans have' or 'you know when I travel I don't learn to speak the local language because we can get by with gesturing'. And I'm like 'well, yes, you can get by with gesturing if all you want to do is point at things and be a bit obnoxious'. But actually, beyond the fact that as far as we can tell every society seems to have gestures, a lot of what we presume is universal about gesture is partly based on this iconicity. So that's something that ties it to emoji and Blissymbols in a way, because there's some relationship between the gesture or the emoji and the thing it's representing or referring to."
1,75,Gretchen,"yes, so if you put your hand up to your mouth, that conveys 'eating' or 'drinking' or something, because when you eat you put things in your mouth, so of course that's what it means."
1,76,Lauren,"in the way a smiley emoji resembles the way your lips curl up when you're happy. This kind of visuality of it makes people think 'well, I can understand it so it must be universal'. But more and more we look at the way different cultures gesture - even something as simple as pointing. We thought for a long time for that index finger pointing was the the default universal way to point. And in fact we now know cultures point with their lip. Or, we know that some people in some cultures because of various taboos or because of style preferences will point with their eyes or their eyebrows, and there's a whole collection of different handshapes you can use to point in indigenous communities in Central Australia. So people will point with an open hand which means a collection, I'm pointing at a collection of things. And also there's taboos in some communities on pointing, or pointing with the index finger, or pointing with the left hand instead of the right hand..."
1,77,Gretchen,"and you know even in English, pointing with your middle finger can sometimes go wrong..."
1,78,Lauren,"in Nepal where I spend a lot of time that is a lot of free variation between index finger and middle finger pointing, and my Westerner sensibilities still giggle at that."
1,79,Gretchen,yeah I had a had a piano teacher once who would just at point with everything with his middle finger and I was thinking 'I know you're just pointing to the stuff but I'm really distracted right now'.
1,80,Lauren,so people are like 'we could all just gesture to each other' or all use sign language -- and sign languages still have all the same grammatical requirements of spoken languages.
1,81,Gretchen,yeah with an occasional bit of iconic convenience for you to learn signs.
1,82,Lauren,but it's not going to bring about world peace.
1,83,Gretchen,"yeah, I mean that there's some iconic stuff about spoken languages as well. There was an interesting recent study trying to look at statistically what are some iconic things that show up in spoken languages? Like the word for 'nose' tends to have an 'n' it because the 'n' sound is a nasal sound -- it's produced by putting air out of your nose. And so in something like two-thirds of the world's languages the word for nose has an 'n' in it which is you know statistically improbable, I guess that's what they found. But two-thirds is a high number for statistics but it's not a universal."
1,84,Lauren,good as we're getting.
1,85,Gretchen,"like it's not every language, it's just a lot of them. You know, it's cool that sometimes you get this, it's part of the way there. But it's not going to automatically give you an entire vocabulary in another language, because there's a lot of stuff that's not obviously iconic."
1,86,Lauren,"grammar, we're back to grammar."
1,87,Gretchen,This is why languages are great because they have all this grammar and they're not completely obvious.
1,88,Lauren,"so a lot of people now are like 'well you know we're basically there with English so let's just make English the universal language'. One industry where that is actually kind of happening is aviation. So you have something now called 'Aviation English' which is an attempt to make sure that people who work in the International Civil Aviation Organization all speak a degree of a particular kind of English that has very set terminology and very set word order and features like that, so that there aren't any miscommunications. In 1977 at Tenerife airport two Boeing 747s collided, and it was basically because one took off too early, because the person in the control tower and the pilot weren't really communicating clearly. The pilot said something non-standard that they were taking off and the person in the control tower assumed that they were going through the standard motions and requesting permission to take off -- and instead of giving the correct reply just said 'ok' which the pilot took as 'okay you can take off now because that's what you just said you would do'. And so that plane collided with another plane midair and many people died. And so now there is very precise standardized phraseology. And there's also one in radio telephony it's the International Phonetic Alphabet -- that's not the linguistic phonetic alphabet, it's the 'Alpha Bravo Charlie' one."
1,89,Gretchen,"I mean it's useful because 'b' and 'c' and 'd' and 'e' and stuff they sound very similar, they all rhyme. And so if you're not quite sure what consonant came with them especially over a terrible radio signal that's really fuzzy, it's easy to misinterpret."
1,90,Lauren,it's also the one that ensures that you have to say 'niner' instead of 'nine'.
1,91,Gretchen,"yeah and you see it sometimes, I mean, I've encountered when you're on the phone with your bank or something and you're spelling something for them and people sometimes use an ad-hoc system. Like, you don't necessarily have memorized the international aviation one but you just pick a common names so you say like 'n' as in 'Nancy' or 'm' as in 'Michael' because N & M sound very similar over the phone. So there's various ways to kind of get by these degraded communications. Another one that I find is very cool which is less about 'let's just do everything in English', but it's still got this high-stakes aspect is on the ISS. On the International Space Station, you have astronauts from the US and from other English speaking countries and you have cosmonauts from Russia. And obviously it's very important to get your communication right if you're on a tiny metal box circling the Earth or going somewhere. You don't want to have a miscommunication there because you could end up floating in space in the wrong way. And so one of the things that they do on the ISS -- so first of all every astronaut and cosmonaut needs to be bilingual in English and Russian because those are the languages of space."
1,92,Lauren,yep. The language of space are English and Russian? I'm sorry I just said 'yep' and then I didn't really think about the fact that that's a fact is it?
1,93,Gretchen,"I mean pretty much, yeah, if you go on astronaut training recruitment you know forums, which I have gone on for research for this episode..."
1,94,Lauren,you're got to have a backup job Gretchen.
1,95,Gretchen,"I don't think I'm going to become an astronaut, but I would like to do astronaut linguistics. And so one of the things they say, is 'you need to know stuff about math and engineering and, like, aerodynamics and you also fly planes in the military and stuff'. Like, these are various things people need to know. And they also say, you know, you either have to arrive knowing English and Russian or they put you through an intensive language training course. When they're up in the air one of the things that they try to do is have the English native speakers speak Russian and the Russian speakers speak English. Because the idea is if you speak your non-native language then you're sure what you're saying and the other person can understand you better. Whereas if you speak your native language, maybe you're speaking too fast or maybe you're not sure if the other person's really understanding you, to get a better kind of comprehension check. If you both speak the language you're not as fluent in then you arrive at a level where where people can be sure that the other person's understanding and there's kind of this hybrid English Russian language I think that's developed not a full-fledged language but kind of a"
1,96,Lauren,Space Creole!
1,97,Gretchen,"this space pidgin that the astronauts need to speak with each other and I don't know if anyone's written a grammar of this, I hope is the case that someone has written a grammar of space pidgin."
1,98,Lauren,that is amazing.
1,99,Gretchen,"I mean, it kind of reminds me of, like, you do get trade languages back you know kind of pre-space-age. The original lingua franca is a Frankish dialect -- an earlier version of French spoken around the Mediterranean by sailors and stuff from a bunch of different areas. And they all speak this kind of trade language with each other, you know, 'space is the final frontier' or something like that."
1,100,Lauren,yeah and we can all speak a Russian English pidgin and then we can colonize Mars and turn into a proper Space Creole.
1,101,Gretchen,"and everything will just become like A Clockwork Orange, like, I don't see what's wrong with this."
1,102,Lauren,"how could this plan go wrong. So, the thing that upsets me the most about the one language bringing peace and happiness fallacy is that like we just know it's wrong from the evidence. People who speak the same language don't inherently get along, and often find ways to hate on each other for speaking the same but ever so slightly different varieties of a language."
1,103,Gretchen,"do people who think that if we all spoke the same language we'd get along, have they ever been in a family? Have they never had arguments?"
1,104,Lauren,you have people who have grown up in exactly the same linguistic environment.
1,105,Gretchen,"yeah, like people get married and then they get divorced it's not because they don't speak the same language, it's because they have irreconcilable differences"
1,106,Lauren,"they probably speak the same language too well ,so they can say all the horrible things to each other."
1,107,Gretchen,"yeah, like you fight with your siblings or something like it's not because you don't speak the same language -- you just don't get along."
1,108,Lauren,"so Australia English as far as like, you know -- you look at America and there's quite a lot of linguistic diversity for one country. Australia is very linguistically homogeneous but when there's a state-based or city-based linguistic variation in Australian English we just lose our collective shit over it. It's kind of impressive how homogeneous Australian English is, and how disproportionately outraged people get about variation. One war that kind of flames up every few years is something known as the 'potato cake / potatoes scallop' war. If you go to a fish-and-chip shop in Australia a particular menu item that's available is a large disk of potato that's deep fried and it's very tasty and it's great like everyone should want to eat them. But for some reason in Victoria and South Australia they're known as potato cakes, in New South Wales and Queensland they're known as scallops or potato scallops, and this just upsets people so much."
1,109,Gretchen,I'm kind of baffled by this because I'm Canadian and I have both the item potato cake and potato scallop they just refer to different things.
1,110,Lauren,so what do they mean in Canadian English?
1,111,Gretchen,so neither of them is your thing.
1,112,Lauren,so both of them are the wrong thing.
1,113,Gretchen,"both of them are the the right thing. Anyway we're not going to have this argument. So potato scallop is like a casserole, you slice the potatoes and then you make like a cream sauce and then you bake it in the oven."
1,114,Lauren,"ah, see that's scalloped potatoes."
1,115,Gretchen,"oh, see scallop potatoes and potato scallop are the same thing for me."
1,116,Lauren,"right, ok."
1,117,Gretchen,then a potato cake is kind of more like your thing but it's not necessarily deep-fried and sometimes there's fish involved i guess like fish cakes?
1,118,Lauren,oh well that's terrible then.
1,119,Gretchen,"no, but you like, you just beat the potato but you don't necessarily deep-fried it you could just pan-fry it."
1,120,Lauren,okay.
1,121,Gretchen,"I think people project their differences and their opinions about other people on the languages. It's not as though the language comes with these particular distinctions itself, it's a proxy for things you think about particular good people or the simmering ethnic divides in Australia between people who live in Victoria and people who don't."
1,122,Lauren,"or just the simmering geographic divides. There's nothing ethnic, there's nothing particularly linguistic, it's purely that the Victorians and the New South Welsh will find any reason to disagree and we don't always have that many so we were reduced to bickering over fried food."
1,123,Gretchen,"at a larger scale, I think people see things like these trade languages or aviation English or like international symbols for the Olympics where you can see the symbol and see o'kay which sporting event does this refer to'? You think 'Wow! OK, people can kind of understand each other maybe if we had more of this we could do more of this trade.' But there's still a big divide when it comes to nationalistically. You know, there are civil wars, there have there been many of them in history. And they aren't because people don't speak the same language in the same country, they're because they do speak the same language and they realize that they hate each other. Or, imposing a language on people just so that you can all speak the same language, you know, this leads to resentment."
1,124,Lauren,"English as a lingua franca these days, we have to remember, it's because of fairly gratuitous and heinous colonial expansion by the British."
1,125,Gretchen,"yeah, Latin as a common language was also due to Latin/Roman imperial expansion. And sometimes you get a common language, but it's not because people just wake up one day and they like to decide that they want to speak this language. It's because they were forced to many cases."
1,126,Lauren,"I talked about Australia being a place where people can get really riled up about the different and potato cake and a potato scallop, and you can think of Australia as being really culturally homogeneous because of that. Like, if that is the level of difference that we're trying to pick a fight about. But actually, Australia is amazingly linguistically diverse and amazingly full of cultural diversity and I think sometimes people can get so caught up in thinking that one language will solve all of these problems that we run the risk of attempting to homogenize or losing really wonderful diversity."
1,127,Gretchen,"yeah, I think just as language can be a thing that we project, you know, our feelings about particular people on. I also think that we protect our hopes for humanity on it. Every Miss America contestant does want world peace, but that's because we do want peace, we do want people to be able to get along, least in theory. It's just that I think a pluralistic way of 'wouldn't be great everyone spoke multiple languages' is maybe more likely to get us there."
1,128,Lauren,Send your complaints to us in the form of emoji.
1,129,Gretchen,and we'll read them out loud on this audio podcast.

2,1,Gretchen,Welcome to Lingthusiasm - a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics. I'm Gretchen McCulloch
2,2,Lauren,"and I'm Lauren Gawne. Today, we're going to be talking about pronouns and how these little words do a lot of work. But first let's talk about where our logo comes from."
2,3,Gretchen,"When we were coming up with the idea that maybe we wanted to start a podcast, we started talking about logos - because that's the first thing, obviously! We realized that Superlinguo, Lauren's blog, uses a yellow-green background and my blog, All Things Linguistic, uses a teal background, kind of a bluish-green. So we figured that a true green, a vivid green, was the logical way of splitting the difference between that."
2,4,Lauren,"We're both big green fans. And we also have IPA symbols in both of our logos. Superlinguo has a schwa and All Things Linguistic has three and... I can't even remember, which ones are there? There's a theta I know that."
2,5,Gretchen,"it's alpha theta lambda, it's an acronym."
2,6,Lauren,Ah yeah that makes sense!
2,7,Gretchen,"Yeah, but they're also symbols that are used in linguistics"
2,8,Lauren,So nerdy linguistic symbol logos meant that we're going to continue that theme with this one as well.
2,9,Gretchen,"And so we ended up going with the one that we have which is a triple purpose logo. If you haven't seen it, it's presumably in the icon of whatever program you're using to listen to this podcast. The symbol looks like the International Phonetic Alphabet symbol for the glottal stop -- that's the sound in 'uh-oh', this kind of stop of air in the back of your throat. But we got it by cutting off the dot at the bottom of a question mark because that gave us more font options."
2,10,Lauren,"Unfortunately, disappointingly few stylish fonts have full symbol range for the International Phonetic Alphabet."
2,11,Gretchen,We were very disappointed! But this was actually one of the reasons why we picked the glottal stop -- because that way we could just chop off some question marks and we'd a lot more stuff to choose from.
2,12,Lauren,And then we liked that the end result of the one that we chose looks a little bit like an ear.
2,13,Gretchen,"Yeah! It looks a little bit like an ear, it looks a little bit like a question mark because we are curious about things, and it is also an IPA symbol."
2,14,Lauren,Because we are quite lingthusiastic about things.
2,15,Gretchen,We are very lingthusiastic! Yay! And the name I guess will probably be pretty obvious. [Music]
2,16,Lauren,"Today we are going to talk about pronouns, which some of you might have a kind of trauma of. It sounds like a dirty word from grammar classes in high school, or some of you may be going into sweats from recollections of learning second languages. But we think pronouns are pretty rad and so today we're going to be talking about them."
2,17,Gretchen,"Yeah, pronouns are fun!So pronouns, if you forget what they are, are these little words that stand in place of a noun. You have things like I, me, you, your, our, we, she/he, it, they. Instead of just continually repeating the noun you can use a pronoun instead. They're a way of making language more efficient, because you don't have to just keep saying the noun over and over again. You've all had this conversation with people who just keep repeating your name and you're like 'No, just stop.'"
2,18,Lauren,It's the creepy way AI robots in sci-fi will always continue to refer to you by your full name and it's really creepy. 'What are you doing Hal?' 'Hal don't do that' always includes that full noun reference and it's super creepy in extended conversation.
2,19,Gretchen,"Yeah you know if you want to try this at home, creep out your friends by saying their names all the time, in every sentence and they'll probably get annoyed at you"
2,20,Lauren,"The thing that makes pronouns so interesting in conversation is, to use the fancy linguist term, they're deictic. To use the actual 'what does that mean?' term, they point at something. And like a pointing finger, they don't always point at exactly the same thing all the time - where they point depends on the context in which they're employed. It sounds painfully obvious until you're trying to pull it apart in a language you don't speak that well, but when I say 'I', I for me means Lauren and 'you' in this context means you Gretchen."
2,21,Gretchen,"Yes, and 'you' also means you the listener, you plural. But when *I* say 'I', I means me Gretchen and not you Lauren, because you're a different person. And the thing is, you can see little kids get this wrong! Like they'll refer to themselves as 'you' because that's what everyone else calls them, and they have to figure out that no, mommy is 'you' and daddy is 'you' and the dog is 'you' but I am 'I'."
2,22,Lauren,When 'I' use it
2,23,Gretchen,"When I use it. And little kids will get this wrong initially often when they're learning a language and so it's not completely obvious to people, but it's a very important insight when it comes to pronouns."
2,24,Lauren,"And that's why robots in AI in sci-fi sound really creepy - it is something that's quite hard to keep track of, these references, and who is being referred to by which pronoun in conversation."
2,25,Gretchen,"Yeah, and different languages kind of carve up the pronoun space differently. I think a lot of languages make a distinction between the person who's doing the talking -- this is the 'I' or 'we', I'm either talking on behalf of myself on behalf of a group -- and the person who's being talked to, which is the you - you singular, you plural. English used to have 'thou' and 'thee' to be a singular second person pronoun, and now we have innovative plural forms like 'you all' and 'you guys' and 'y'all' and a whole bunch of others."
2,26,Lauren,'youse'. 'youse' is the Australian one.
2,27,Gretchen,"Good, so we have all of these different ways of carving up the the pronoun space. And then in the third person pronouns we have a whole bunch of different ways -"
2,28,Lauren,"And even within the first and second person, so the first being 'me' and second being 'you' - even within those there are lots of different ways to carve up the space, and lots of different languages do different things that are really neat. One thing I like about Yolmo, which is a Tibetan language that I work with, is that they have inclusive and exclusive versions of 'us', and the inclusion and exclusion is referring to the person that you're speaking to. So you can use one form and it means 'we including you who I'm talking to you right now are all going to go to the cinema' and then there's a 'we are all going to the cinema but we're not including you who I'm talking to right now in that group of we' which I think is a socially very handy thing to have."
2,29,Gretchen,"Yeah it makes the difference between 'we're going to the movies, are you ready yet?' and 'we're going to the movies, see you later!'"
2,30,Lauren,"Yep, as someone who is incredibly incapable of reading social interactions very well, I think this kind of thing in English would be so handy to know if you're included in the trip to drinks after work, or if you're included in the meeting or something like that."
2,31,Gretchen,"Yeah, it's a it's a really useful distinction this inclusive and exclusive we, and English doesn't have it. That's one of things I wish English had"
2,32,Lauren,Yeah
2,33,Gretchen,"yeah, that's a fun one. And English is kind of gradually working on trying to figure out a plural 'you' form. We've got a bunch of different dialects but not a standard one for writing, and that's a massive lack because you want to be able to distinguish between 'are you coming?' and 'are all of you coming?' because, again, who's invited.?And then another distinction that gets made with second person pronouns, is you can make a lot of politeness distinctions in second person. So you can say 'you' informal, 'you' formal. So I speak French, and French makes a distinction between 'tu' and 'vous' - where 'tu' is informal and also singular, and 'vous' can be either singular or plural. When it's singular it's formal. I find actually the weird thing about this is I get annoyed, because I don't have an equivalent of 'you all', like I don't have a way of being unambiguously plural, because sometimes you know if I go to a store and I want to say 'do you guys have any bananas?' or something and I don't want to imply..."
2,34,Lauren,As opposed to 'you specific cashier do you have any bananas with you right now?'
2,35,Gretchen,"Yeah I, I don't want to put them on the spot, like, it's not your fault if you're out of bananas, that's the store manager's fault or something. So it's weird to me that I don't have an unambiguously plural pronoun, but I do instead have to navigate this politeness distinction. Particularly when you're dealing with kind of strangers you meet in public and so you don't have any frame of reference to know anything about them already - do you use the the 'tu' or the 'vous' ? it kind of depends on their age, and whether it seems like you're peers or they're like an older person you want to respect them or something like that."
2,36,Lauren,"As an English native speaker, growing up with the language that doesn't have any kind of politeness distinction like that, and growing up in Australia which is kind of stereotypically famous for its lack of formal register - even though that's not entirely true. This distinction in formality really made me - and you hear this a lot from English speakers when they learn languages with these pronoun difference distinctions - it really stresses them out as to which one is appropriate. I started learning Nepali which has, not only two, it had three different politeness distinctions. So it has the formal polite pronoun and then it has the like one that you can use with people who you're close to, and then it has one that is for children and dogs. So my Nepali teacher just didn't even teach me that last one - she was like 'as a foreigner there is no social situation in which that one is going to be appropriately useful for you' and so trying to navigate when which one is appropriate it can be, it can feel a bit stressful."
2,37,Gretchen,I get it because - so I learned France French but now I live in Quebec - but in France French they use 'vous' a lot more than in Quebec French. So in Quebec French to a stranger in public you're a lot more likely to say 'tu' whereas in France French you're more likely to say 'vous'
2,38,Lauren,Hmmm
2,39,Gretchen,So I know I'm too formal for some people and like they'll 'vous' me back
2,40,Lauren,Yep
2,41,Gretchen,But they don't really think they should be needing to.
2,42,Lauren,"Right yeah, and because there's this thing, like maybe being polite is just the best default thing to do, but then in some social situations it actually pushes people away and makes it difficult."
2,43,Gretchen,"Yeah, being polite can kinda create this social distance."
2,44,Lauren,Yep
2,45,Gretchen,"There's some languages were using words like 'please' and 'thank you' or polite forms to ask someone to pass you the beans or whatever, it is actually rude if you say them to a family member, because you shouldn't have to be polite to a family member. And that's a sign of social distance between you, so yeah politeness pronouns are very complicated thing."
2,46,Lauren,"And they're complicated for native speakers. So there's an article in the latest edition of 'Language' which is a scholarly journal and it looks at pronouns in Spanish. so Spanish has a very similar distinction to that in French, where it has a formal and informal register. And so this work was done by Chase Wesley Raymond who's at the University of Colorado and this was a massive corpus study, so there are over a thousand speakers in the corpus and hundreds of hours of recorded conversations between different people in different contexts, and this study demonstrating... you know, people who speak these languages probably have these feelings anyway, but this study demonstrated that when people use polite or the formal or informal pronouns these aren't fixed. There's no clear rule that you can put in a textbook to learn, it's that these things are negotiated and they can change and people can shift to being informal to throw someone off or they can become more formal because they're in the workplace, whereas they might be less formal if they're hanging out with this person in some other context. So even for native speakers there's not always a kind of fixed rule 'oh this person is my superior so I will always use the polite form' or something like that."
2,47,Gretchen,"Yeah I think that was one of the things that surprised me is I found that sometimes I would use the pronouns inconsistently and I thought that I was doing something wrong as a non-native speaker of French, that I was using 'vous' and 'tu' at the same person sometimes, and yet it turns out that that's something a lot of people do and to try to negotiate that. I thought because the textbooks give you a model of 'Okay we have to have this dialogue where we officially say 'Shall we now 'tu' each other?'' and that's not a dialogue I've actually had very often."
2,48,Lauren,Yep
2,49,Gretchen,"Because people often figure it out. But yeah, it's an important question. Let's move on to third-person pronouns"
2,50,Lauren,Okay
2,51,Gretchen,Because there's also a lot of interesting stuff that goes on with them
2,52,Lauren,Yep!
2,53,Gretchen,One thing that happens with third-person pronouns is what I have called in a blog post The Gay Fanfiction Problem.
2,54,Lauren,That very serious linguistic problem.
2,55,Gretchen,"It's a very serious linguistic problem that happens when you have a narrative with multiple people using the same pronoun, and you have to figure out, with a sentence like, 'he touched his hand', who's touching whose hand or other parts of the body."
2,56,Lauren,"Yeah, especially when this has been going on for multiple paragraphs."
2,57,Gretchen,"Yeah, for pages and pages and pages. And you don't want to necessarily keep repeating their names. You often get people using epithets like 'the taller one' or 'the shorter one' but then it's not always clear which character is actually taller, which character is shorter, who's younger, or which one is blonde or something like that if you want to use descriptions of them. So to try figure out how do we track multiple people when we're telling a story with people and we want to have the efficiency gain of using pronouns but -"
2,58,Lauren,"Everyone's a 'he', or everyone's a 'she'"
2,59,Gretchen,"Yeah so one of the things people ask about pronouns sometimes is why do we have gender in pronouns, and one of the reasons is that it's a rough-and-ready way of trying to divide the population into two equal groups. And it's not perfect but it's better than some of our other options -- like dividing people into groups of tall and short people, or young and old people or something like that. It kind of works in a lot of situations that statistically some people in a group will be male and some people in a group will be female. So, you know, it's not The Straight Fanfiction problem because those ones you do have pronouns to tell apart"
2,60,Lauren,If there are only two people in an interaction
2,61,Gretchen,"Well so there's two problems, right, there's the Gay Fanfiction Problem, and then there's the orgy fanfic problem - sorry, the Poly Fanfiction Problem and those are two separate problems."
2,62,Lauren,"Yep, but when they collide it's very complicated."
2,63,Gretchen,"when they collide it's even worse, yeah, then there's The Gay Poly Fanfiction problem'."
2,64,Lauren,Not all languages have this problem for their gay fanfiction
2,65,Gretchen,"I don't know if all languages write gay fanfiction but they presumably all tell stories were multiple people are involved. Lauren, you have an interesting example of this not happening?"
2,66,Lauren,"One example is where you have two different third person singular pronouns, one that you use for one referent and one you use for a referent that has already been discussed. The fancy word for this is 'logophoric pronouns'. Essentially what logophoric pronouns can do is solve the problem of when you say something like 'he said that he is going to cook a barbecue for us on the weekend'. So in isolation or in an ongoing context if you're talking about Bob and Dave and you could say 'Bob said that Dave's going to cook a barbeque on the weekend' or 'Bob said that Bob himself will cook a barbecue on the weekend'. But if you're just using pronouns, 'he said that he's going to cook a barbecue on the weekend' -- you don't actually know if 'he' is the person that will do the cooking or if 'he' is assigning someone else that promise. And so logophoric pronouns like 'he', 'the person who said that he will cook a barbecue' or 'he said that some other him will cook the barbecue'."
2,67,Gretchen,Yeah so you have a different pronoun for referring back to the person who was already speaking vs referring to a different person from the one who was speaking
2,68,Lauren,"Yeah, and so I think it would solve that 'he put his hands on his hips' problem, where it would become clear if someone's putting his hands on his own hips or on some other dude's hips."
2,69,Gretchen,I don't know if that solves that problem. It solves the 'he said that he loved him' problem.
2,70,Lauren,Oh yeah
2,71,Gretchen,"Or you know 'he said that he wanted to come over' or something... I don't actually speak a language with logophors, so don't know if you can do it with 'he put his hand on his hip'."
2,72,Lauren,"No, to be honest I don't know these languages well enough to make that promise to be honest."
2,73,Gretchen,"What I was going to say is that, one thing that I know does solve this problem which is not logophors, is a different phenomenon which is known as obviation. And that's a phenomenon where your pronouns, instead of having gender, they track how important someone is to the discourse. So basically you have the more important or the more central person get one pronoun and the less important or less central or less vocal person or persons get a different pronoun."
2,74,Lauren,Oh I can see that being handy.
2,75,Gretchen,"Yeah and so sometimes it's called third person and fourth person -- in the sense that, if you have a have a scenario with multiple people in it, the third person is obviously more important or more central somehow than the fourth person. And this is of course a storytelling device, so you can decide as the storyteller who is more important to your story. There's no gender involved so either it's 'third person put third person's hands on fourth person's hips' or 'third person put third person's hands on third person's hips'. So you can track who's who along that situation and that allows you to very easily keep track of two different persons. And the way you know which is third and which is fourth is, when you first say their names or you first say the noun or something that's associated with them that the pronouns are going to have to refer to, is you put a little marker on the names like a suffixm that indicates that this one is going to be your third person one and this is going to be your fourth person one and then afterwards you can just refer back to them with that."
2,76,Lauren,Nice
2,77,Gretchen,"So it's very interesting from a storytelling perspective because then you can retell the story the same way if you just swap which one is obviative, which one is fourth person, then the story gets completely different focus which is kind of interesting."
2,78,Lauren,Cool
2,79,Gretchen,So obviation does a great job of solving the gay fanfiction problem. It doesn't do a whole lot to solve the poly fanfiction problem because generally you have a third person and a fourth person and so if you end up with 4 or 5 people in a scenario that's not -
2,80,Lauren,It's not enough pronouns to go around.
2,81,Gretchen,"Yeah. Some languages have a more obscure pronoun known as the 'further obviate'. It's like a fifth person, so you can have like three people of various levels of importance in this scenario but I haven't seen it used a whole lot because I guess making this distinction two ways is enough for a lot of languages."
2,82,Lauren,"And of course there are a set of languages where none of this is a problem at all, and they are sign languages that use spatial locations for pronominal reference. So in sign languages, generally what happens is to make the equivalent of a pronoun in a language like English, they all sign someone's name or a reference to someone or their actions in a particular space and then that space will be used to call back to that person throughout the interaction. Or the person can move around in the kind of signing space but they're always able to be spatially referred to."
2,83,Gretchen,So signing space could be like 'top left' or 'towards the right of the person' who's signing or something like that.
2,84,Lauren,"Yeah. I mean, when you speak English and you gesture across a narrative you're possibly doing this without really thinking about it anyway. So you may be referring to - who were my barbecuers again, Bob and Dave?"
2,85,Gretchen,Yeah
2,86,Lauren,"Bob and Dave might get referred to as if Bob's on the left, Dave's on the right and I kind of keep referring to them and gesturing throughout the interaction, but in sign languages like Auslan, which is the one I know this type of example from best, Bob will get put in a particular space and he'll be signed there and then he'll kind of keeping called back to from there."
2,87,Gretchen,"So if the barbecue is to the left of us and Bob's by the barbecue that we set up the barbecue on the left, we set up Bob near the BBQ, and then we have Dave over by the house on the right."
2,88,Lauren,Yeah
2,89,Gretchen,Something like that.
2,90,Lauren,"And so if Bob says something, I'll sign what Bob said in the left-hand space"
2,91,Gretchen,Or kind of turn your body towards that space
2,92,Lauren,Yeah
2,93,Gretchen,As if you're speaking from Bob's perspective
2,94,Lauren,Yeah
2,95,Gretchen,I don't know much ASL but I've seen people talk about this in ASL as well.
2,96,Lauren,It's a very elegant solution.
2,97,Gretchen,"It's beautiful. And the nice thing about it is you're not limited to just having people on the left or people on the right, because you could have someone that's kind of like 'top-left', 'bottom-left', 'top right', 'bottom right'"
2,98,Lauren,Yeah I don't know what the maximum number is... I guess it's however many people can kind of keep track of in the narrative.
2,99,Gretchen,I feel like I've heard someone say seven but that might be false.
2,100,Lauren,"A good storyteller, surely"
2,101,Gretchen,"Yeah, if you're like a really good storyteller you can keep track, just kind of fan them out around your face."
2,102,Lauren,Yep
2,103,Gretchen,"But definitely you can do more than two, which is fantastic. And it doesn't matter anything about their gender because you can just set them up wherever you want."
2,104,Lauren,"Gender doesn't matter, number doesn't matter, all of those kind of things."
2,105,Gretchen,"So sign languages have solved the gay fan fiction orgy problem, all other languages will have to figure out how to do that."
2,106,Lauren,"playing catch-up, really"
2,107,Gretchen,Yeah you know or just learn a sign language so that you can write better fanfiction.
2,108,Lauren,Yeah
2,109,Gretchen,Because that's a good reason
2,110,Lauren,The obvious solution
2,111,Gretchen,"The clear and obvious solution! So we we talked about language typology systems, but another thing that comes up in English and other languages is the idea of a gender-neutral pronoun especially in the third person."
2,112,Lauren,"Yeah, we are technically unable to do this podcast on pronouns without mentioning English singular they, it would be a crime."
2,113,Gretchen,Because it's the one that keeps making the headlines.
2,114,Lauren,"It's been very popular, it was Word of the Year for the American Dialect Society last year in 2015."
2,115,Gretchen,Yes it was! I was there for that vote and we were pretty excited about it.
2,116,Lauren,Did you vote for singular they?
2,117,Gretchen,"Yes, of course I did, I actually wrote a whole article nominating it for word of the year."
2,118,Lauren,So what even is singular they?
2,119,Gretchen,"So singular they is the use of 'they' which is traditionally thought of as - and I'm going to put a large asterisk besides this because I'm going to get back to that - as a plural third person pronoun, as a singular pronoun instead. And it is not a new thing in English, this is why I wanted to but an asterisk by that use of 'traditionally' because using 'they' in a singular form is actually very very old. So this is examples like if you say 'someone left their umbrella' and you don't know whose umbrella it is but generally people don't share in joint ownership of umbrellas, probably."
2,120,Lauren,"Not in this day and age of affordable umbrellas. And when you say it's not recent, Jane Austen used singular they in this context, Shakespeare used singular they in this context."
2,121,Gretchen,"Chaucer used singular they, it goes all the way back to Old English, in fact singular 'they' is only about a hundred years younger than singular 'you'."
2,122,Lauren,Right
2,123,Gretchen,So if you remember when we started losing 'thou'
2,124,Lauren,"Oh yeah I remember that, back in the day."
2,125,Gretchen,"I know just get in your time travel box and go back to when people started using 'you' for singular, then jump forward about a hundred years and you'll hear people starting to use they as singular. In fact I don't know maybe they were using earlier, that's just when we have written records."
2,126,Lauren,Prove it to us with an example
2,127,Gretchen,"Yeah, so this is going to be me badly pronouncing Middle English"
2,128,Lauren,Yessss
2,129,Gretchen,"Because I am not an English historian. So this is from Chaucer's 'The Pardoner's' prologue, around 1395, which goes 'and whoso findeth himself without such blame they will come up'. And so this means approximately 'and whoever finds him whatever out of such blame, they will come up'. So this 'whoever' is a nonspecific singular person and you can tell it's singular because it's using the conjugation 'findeth' and then 'they' is being used to refer back to 'whoso'."
2,130,Lauren,"Yeah, okay"
2,131,Gretchen,"And here's one from 1489, which goes 'each of them should make themself ready' so that the example of singular 'themself' from Caxton."
2,132,Lauren,He is also old
2,133,Gretchen,He is also very old. And here's the Shakespeare example which goes 'there's not a man I meet but doth salute me and I were their well acquainted friend'. That's from 'Comedy of Errors' in 1594.
2,134,Lauren,"So Shakespeare said it, must be legit"
2,135,Gretchen,"Shakespeare said it, must be legit."
2,136,Lauren,"Right, so this is not a new and exciting thing, why the hell was it Word of the Year last year?"
2,137,Gretchen,"Yeah so why talk about it as if it's something new? Well, for one reason, the Word of the Year doesn't have to be brand-new, it's generally 'newly prominent'. So people are talking about it more, and when you looked at what types of words people were talking about in 2015, singular they showed up in there. I did a Google N-gram search that showed that people were searching for it more, it seemed to be there was a meeting of the American Copy Editor Society which Ben Zimmer was at and reported on people talking about singular they a lot there. And then a lot of people read Ben Zimmer's article about the copy editors meeting and thought 'oh well that's interesting' so there was a lot of talking about singular they."
2,138,Lauren,Right
2,139,Gretchen,"And what a lot of people were talking about with singular they was not just this non specific usage, this stuff like you know 'each of them should make themself ready' or you know 'and whoever finds him they should come', it's this specific usage for a particular person, which is also not completely new, but not as old as Shakespeare."
2,140,Lauren,"RIght. So, older examples it's talking about 'they' as in it could be anyone. Whereas now it's about a specific person in the way that 'you' is about a specific person or 'he' or 'she'."
2,141,Gretchen,"Yeah, so it's about a specific person, so in the way that I prefer people refer to me with the pronoun 'she' and 'her' when they're talking about me in third person, some people say 'could you please refer to me using the pronouns 'they' and 'them' when you're talking about me in the third person' and that's something that's a newer phenomenon."
2,142,Lauren,Yep
2,143,Gretchen,So referring to someone as 'they' as a specific person so if you say something like 'Alex looked at themself in the mirror'.
2,144,Lauren,Yeah
2,145,Gretchen,And so you have singular they there.
2,146,Lauren,Yep
2,147,Gretchen,Because the thing is for the nonspecific kind of singular they is that you can often find a way to write around if you're not a fan. You can recast the sentence in the plural or you can use a passive or you can do various things to try to get rid of that 'they' if you're really determined that it can only be singular.
2,148,Lauren,Yeah
2,149,Gretchen,"But for an individual person who says 'please refer to me as they', the only way to get around that is our gay fanfiction problem where you have to refer to them by their name every single time."
2,150,Lauren,And that's just creepy.
2,151,Gretchen,It's just creepy! It gets really weird sounding really quickly
2,152,Lauren,"Yeah I mean, unless that's a person's preference, and then as well as you can deal with the cognitive load of that fair enough."
2,153,Gretchen,Yeah it is definitely a lot more difficult if you don't have any pronouns at all to refer to someone.
2,154,Lauren,Yeah
2,155,Gretchen,"So singular they as an individual pronoun for specific person is a phenomenon that people have been advocating for a lot more recently, and it's gotten a lot more visibility. And then that becomes kind of 'Well, if you're going to accept singular they to refer to a specific person, why not let the nonspecific use in by the back door while we're at it?'"
2,156,Lauren,"Yeah it's a much easier way to get it in. You're just kind of pushing a little in the paradigm and creating a little space that people are increasingly finding is necessary. And it may feel a bit weird now and I know some people really struggle to find it grammatically acceptable but I think over time it will normalize, and a good example of the likelihood of that is from Sweden. So Sweden has a 'she' and 'he' equivalent it's 'hon' and 'han' - I'm definitely not saying those right, sorry Swedish people. But now Swedish speakers officially have the option using a gender-neutral form 'hen'. Officially, as in, it's now in all government documents and legal anything where it doesn't need to refer to someone specifically as male or female, the form 'hen' can now be used."
2,157,Gretchen,"Yeah and we know that even if the current generation of speakers have a bit of difficulty with it, if you expose kids to something, it's something they can learn. In particular, general neutral pronouns are things that many languages have and so there's no reason why kids can't learn that in English as well, even if it's a bit harder for an adult. But I mean, adults can learn whole new languages! It takes some effort, but you can learn a new language, so learning some new pronouns for a given language, yeah it takes some effort but it's not impossible."
2,158,Lauren,"No, my feeling is, if someone wants to be called by whatever pronouns they want to, they've generally gone through a lot more massive process in their life to come to that decision and feel comfortable with sharing it with people than I have to go through to change a very tiny part of my linguistic behaviour."
2,159,Gretchen,Yeah I feel like it hurts the other person more for me not to use their correct pronouns than it does for me to figure out how to use those myself.
2,160,Lauren,Yeah
2,161,Gretchen,"Singular they is one of the most visible of these gender neutral third-person pronouns for English because it has this nonspecific use that's been going on for a long time, but there is also a whole set of other nonspecific third-person pronouns that are used in English."
2,162,Lauren,So people have come up with other suggestions to kind of fill the paradigm but not create the same problem that we have with 'you' where it can be singular or plural.
2,163,Gretchen,"Yeah, so there's a whole bunch of those and they actually go back to the 1850s."
2,164,Lauren,Really?! I didn't know they were that old
2,165,Gretchen,"Yeah, so the earliest usage -- insofar that there are records of it because I haven't been able to find ones on the non-binary activism side but maybe they exist -- but the one that I have records of are grammarians saying, 'Well, gosh, we can't deal with this plural pronoun being used for the singular so let's invent one for the singular because clearly it's necessary to have a non-gendered alternative for the singular'. So they're approaching it, at least in the record that i'm aware of, they're approaching it from a grammatical perspective initially."
2,166,Lauren,I love that.
2,167,Gretchen,"Yeah, so the term is 'epicene pronoun' and it goes way back"
2,168,Lauren,There you go. Do you know what the original candidate suggestion was or what the suggestions were?
2,169,Gretchen,"There's this lovely website from Dennis Baron at the University of Illinois, and he has a chronology of early non-binary pronouns"
2,170,Lauren,Right
2,171,Gretchen,and oh wow - sorry - the earliest examples that he has is from 1792 so that's actually earlier than the 1850s.
2,172,Lauren,Right!
2,173,Gretchen,"And this is the Scottish economist and philosopher James Anderson, who writes an article arguing for the usefulness of an indeterminate pronoun like the pronoun 'oo' recently reported in provincial use. Dennis Barron goes on to say that in fact Anderson went overboard suggesting that English would benefit from 13 genders including two indefinite or common gender pronouns"
2,174,Lauren,Well he's trying to solve the poly gay fanfiction orgy scenario.
2,175,Gretchen,"Oh yeah wow this is really interesting, um so I'm just looking at this list..."
2,176,Lauren,This is what happens when you do research while reading it out loud Gretchen.
2,177,Gretchen,The internet is beautiful! So if you look at his list he has pronouns to denote 'male animals alone;'
2,178,Lauren,Right
2,179,Gretchen,"'female animals alone; inanimate objects alone; animate objects which either express a general class or whole genus or where it is not necessary to specify sex at all, animals known to be castrated and meant to be distinguished as such,'"
2,180,Lauren,ok
2,181,Gretchen,"'male and females known to be such, though not meant to be separated' - this is what he calls the matrimonial gender!"
2,182,Lauren,urrrgh
2,183,Gretchen,"so he's not gay enough - 'males only, part perfect and part castrated.' Oh, perfect being non castrated, hmm that's an interesting terminology; 'females and castrata; males, females and castrata; males and inanimates conjoined; females and inanimates conjoined; males, females and inanimates conjoined' - these are not matrimonial gendered"
2,184,Lauren,I am tired!
2,185,Gretchen,"'males, females and inanimates either separated or conjoined where no distinction gender was to be meant it was averted to in any way. This precisely the power of present pronoun they.' So that's finally his 13th gender pronoun."
2,186,Lauren,Phew! I've forgotten the first one now.
2,187,Gretchen,"Yeah so 13 genders, probably not necessary, but this is the proposal from 1792, and then just two years later there's another article providing a critique, explanation and defense of singular they, and another call for the coining of a common gender pronoun."
2,188,Lauren,There we go
2,189,Gretchen,"And we get one from 1808, someone suggesting that we use 'it' for our gender neutral pronoun"
2,190,Lauren,I think 'xe' and 'xir' is the one I know of that has the most traction.
2,191,Gretchen,Yeah so 'xe' and 'xir' is one of the best-known ones and it does not show up in the early list. So there's a whole bunch of early proposals for gender neutral pronouns and we'll include a link to this fantastic page about them.
2,192,Lauren,Fabulous
2,193,Gretchen,"But the best-known one at the moment I think is 'xe/xir' which is spelled a couple different ways, there's 'xe', 'xir', 'xie', 'xer', couple different options there."
2,194,Lauren,Yep
2,195,Gretchen,"Oh some people spell it with a 'z' as well, 'zie' or 'ze', but as far as I know people generally pronounce the 'x' one as also a 'z'"
2,196,Lauren,"Yep, so English pronouns have been changing as long as there has been English and they will continue to change whether that's the inclusion of singular they or 'xe' becoming more popular. Maybe we'll finally go back to having a plural you form that everyone agrees on."
2,197,Gretchen,"Yeah, I think we're on our way to a 'you' form, but you know we definitely haven't gotten there. Maybe if we have singular 'they' then we'll end up with like 'they all' or 'th'all', like with 'you all' and 'y'all' '"
2,198,Lauren,'theys'
2,199,Gretchen,'theys'
2,200,Lauren,'thinz'
2,201,Gretchen,"'thines'. 'They guys' does not work for me, I guess you could have 'those guys' but then you run into a gender problem, so.."
2,202,Lauren,Yep
2,203,Gretchen,"Probably I don't support that one. But 'th'all', I don't know, I can get my head around that, because then you have this nice like 'y'all/th'all' paradigm"
2,204,Lauren,'th'all'
2,205,Gretchen,Yeah
2,206,Lauren,Yeah I like it
2,207,Gretchen,Yeah.
2,208,Lauren,"There you go, we've solved English for you."
2,209,Gretchen,"We've solved it! And now we just need to make everyone else do the thing which as we've seen is, is always a challenge. [Music]"

3,1,Lauren,Welcome to Lingthusiasm! A podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics. I'm Lauren Gawne.
3,2,Gretchen,"and I'm Gretchen McCulloch. And today we're going to be talking about the linguist film, Arrival. But first, Lauren what have you been up to these days?"
3,3,Lauren,I am enjoying getting a fair amount of work done and published which is a rare and exciting feat in academia sometimes. So I have a descriptive grammar of Yolmo which is the language that I worked with for my PhD and that's now available. I'm really excited because it's an open-access book which means that anyone can download it and read it for free
3,4,Gretchen,Yay!
3,5,Lauren,I'll put the link to that in the show notes for those who are in any way interested in the grammar of Tibetan dialects of languages spoken in Nepal. I know many of you are. But it's really really exciting.
3,6,Gretchen,It's a bit niche.
3,7,Lauren,"Yeah. You've seen Arrival - now read detailed descriptions of the distribution of ergativity! Now, that's been happening and i'm going to a conference called LDLT so it's Language Documentation and Linguistic Theory in December at SOAS University which is also the university I'm at. So a no travel required conference - always a bonus! So if there's anything interesting to report there I will report back"
3,8,Gretchen,I look forward to hearing about it
3,9,Lauren,What have you been up to?
3,10,Gretchen,"I have been working away in the background on my book about internet language and the future of English. Which is something that occupies a lot of my time but currently has nothing that I can share with people, so. I'm trying to get the second draft done and into my editor so, you know, it's making progress! It's taking shape to be a real book which is exciting."
3,11,Lauren,yay!
3,12,Gretchen,"But there's still a lot of editing ahead of me. I also just got back from EmojiCon which is a conference about emoji, where I met some members of the Unicode Consortium. That's the shadowy committee that decides which emoji we have. I had a lot of conversations about what types of things should be represented and what the role of a technological standard is implementing that. So I think that's really interesting because it's kind of the opposite of how dictionaries work. Like dictionaries are just playing catch-up you know people decide to use words and then the dictionary adds them. Whereas for emoji, because they're a technological thing, the committee has to decide first based on sometimes shadowy evidence whether or not an emoji is going to be desired by a lot of people. So that was very interesting."
3,13,Lauren,"It's funny occasionally at the moment I message someone and I'm just like 'ah, I wish there was an emoji for this thing it would be really handy right now.' So all I have to do is lobby the Unicode Consortium apparently."
3,14,Gretchen,"Yeah, you can write a proposal! You make like a PDF document that has the reasons and some kind of google trends data, to try to provide some sort of justification for whether people are searching for it or whether people are tagging stuff with that on Instagram. Or something like whether it's a concept that's being used -- because I mean obviously if it's just something very obscure they're going to say no."
3,15,Lauren,Hmm!
3,16,Gretchen,So if you ever want to write an emoji proposal i can point you to where to do that.
3,17,Lauren,"There you go, I learned a thing today [MUSIC]"
3,18,Gretchen,Shall we talk about Arrival?
3,19,Lauren,"Yes. I mean, I feel like I've been talking about nothing else but maybe people who aren't linguists haven't been quite as excited as linguist internet has been about the film Arrival."
3,20,Gretchen,"Yeah, the linguist internet has been very excited about it. But I also have the linguist who consulted for Arrival on my facebook so I've been seeing all her posts about it."
3,21,Lauren,Not only do you have her on your facebook but she was like your teacher right?
3,22,Gretchen,Yeah she was my advisor in grad school - I worked with her on my thesis.
3,23,Lauren,"That is amazing. So, for people who don't know what the film arrival is about you saw it slightly more recently than me Gretchen so it's a week fresher in your brain."
3,24,Gretchen,"So Amy Adams plays a linguistics professor and the linguistics professor gets called upon to-- Aliens arrived! Sorry, aliens arrived and nobody can talk with them."
3,25,Lauren,I love that you start with the linguistics professor. There's a linguistics professor!
3,26,Gretchen,"Yeah I start with the linguistics professor because that's clearly the most important part, but there are also aliens and no one can communicate with them because they're aliens and we don't have a universal translator 'cause that's not a real thing guys. And so the military comes knocking on her door and says 'hey, can you figure out how to talk to these aliens for us?' And she's like, 'Yeah I guess ok.' And she goes and tries to figure out, you know, what they have in common and what they can talk about and kind of builds up from basic words into more complicated stuff. So she can finally ask them what is their purpose on earth? What are they doing here? And then like stuff happens. I think this is going to be a spoilery review because the movie's been out long enough."
3,27,Lauren,We're not doing this so shortly afterwards. If people are listening to this they've had plenty of opportunity to see the film. Or press pause right now and come back.
3,28,Gretchen,"Press pause, go watch the film, come back when you have seen it!"
3,29,Lauren,So the reason that this film has endeared itself to linguists and the general word nerd community is that it is a relatively authentic representation of the kind of steps you need to go through when you find yourself having to communicate with someone who you have no language or communication system in common with. And I think that's why it's been so appealing. And it's a really compelling part of the story as well because it means that they don't fall back on this kind of deus ex machina universal translator or interpreter or something like that. Trying to communicate is the major driving force behind the film.
3,30,Gretchen,"Yeah and the process of trying to figure out a language when you have no language in common with the people who are speaking it is a real thing, it's called monolingual elicitation. Ken Hale, who is a former professor at MIT, is the best known person who's done that. There are demonstrations for linguistic students about doing this. So it's a real thing that people have to do.I've seen a monolingual fieldwork demonstration and you generally start with very concrete objects. You pick up a stick, you pick up a rock, or you gesture to yourself and you say your own name. And this type of thing -- body parts, stuff that's around you, that you can point to. And you work on the assumption that the other person also wants to communicate and they also understand that communication is a thing and that words are a thing. And you're just trying to convey your intent that you want to try to learn their language. And then you can start acting stuff out like 'I drop the stick' or 'I'm walking' 'I'm falling' you don't necessarily know if they're giving you a word for 'walk' or if they're giving you a word for 'go' or if they're giving you a word for 'move'. So you have to figure that out later. But you're at least getting some sort of verb and you can see kind of what the verbs do and stuff like that. So, monolingual fieldwork is a real thing that people do with humans and in theory if we got in contact with aliens that would be something we'd have to do."
3,31,Lauren,"Yeah we're lucky that they are embodied aliens. Like, they're aliens that have bodies and as far as we can tell those bodies belong to separate entities because if there was some kind of like hive-mind who didn't realize that individual humans were communicating with them separately."
3,32,Gretchen,"Yeah or if, as is more likely, we're making contact with them via radio waves or pulses of light or something like that and we didn't have bodies in common at all, that could be a lot more difficult."
3,33,Lauren,Yeah so really the fact that they turned up in giant spaceships is very convenient
3,34,Gretchen,Very convenient
3,35,Lauren,To doing linguist-based fieldwork
3,36,Gretchen,And that the spaceship has a kind of like built-in whiteboard thing. It's like they knew.
3,37,Lauren,Yeah that was pretty cool.
3,38,Gretchen,"Very helpful. Thanks, aliens, good job! I think actually in the short story, they just sent in like a television screen for the aliens. They didn't actually have the aliens physically there."
3,39,Lauren,"Yeah, so some people may know this, but the film is based on a short story about essentially the same premise of aliens come to earth and we have to learn to communicate with them. But there's something really beautifully mundane about the short story. So in the short story 120 of these screens essentially appear across the earth and pairs of aliens turn up to them and work with humans to kind of communicate. And instead of people being in a mass hysteria about it, which is a kind of driving tension in the film, everyone's actually just pretty chill. Like, they go in, they worked with the aliens, and then they go home at the end of the day."
3,40,Gretchen,"Yeah, it's a lot calmer there's less of this like tension music. The short story is called The Story of Your Life and it's by Ted Chiang. It was published quite a long time ago. The creators of this film spent a while trying to figure out how to get it made because it's not a very Hollywood story. So they did have to up the tension which I think works well in the movie context where you have people wondering if there's going to be riots in the streets and you know people complaining about the government and dramatic news reports and all this stuff. But at the same time I think that there's something very intimate about the short story. So the movie itself the director was Denis Villeneuve who is a Montreal-based director he's from Montreal, his family's here. That's why they filmed it in Montreal."
3,41,Lauren,"Ah, I thought it was just because of that thing where Canada's cheap for Hollywood to shoot in."
3,42,Gretchen,"Probably that too, I'm sure the tax breaks did help. But i think the reason why Montreal specifically with because yeah he has family here. So they were filming in Montreal I think some of these scenes at the university were filmed at Concordia. And when they filmed it in the summer of 2015 they got in touch with some professors at McGill University. I know they got in touch with several different professors. So, Jessica Coon, who was the one that was my advisor, was the primary linguistics consultant for the film because she has done fieldwork and she's kind of a similar age demographic to Amy Adams. So if you're going to model stuff off her I guess it makes sense. Jessica said they asked her what kind of bag she carries so that they could give Amy Adams a similar laptop bag. And then they also worked with Morgan Sonderegger who's also a prof at McGill on some of the audiovisual stuff. So I think he's the one that's responsible for them using Praat on the computer screens."
3,43,Lauren,"Apparently it's not real Praat it's like fake Praat. So these are the kind of details that linguists get really excited about in this film. But when you pan over the computer screens that different analysts are using in dealing with these aliens, a lot of the software looks really familiar. And one of the pieces of software that linguists use to analyze spectrograms, which is a kind of visualization of sound patterns, is a program called Praat. It's adorable it was written in the eighties or nineties and it still looks like it today."
3,44,Gretchen,It's a pretty old-school looking program but it works great
3,45,Lauren,Every generation who was trained on computers to do phonetic analysis was trained with Praat. We have warm and fuzzy feelings towards it so seeing something that looks very much like that piece of software on screen was nerd points plus.
3,46,Gretchen,"Yeah so that was good. So i think he's responsible for that. And then when they were figuring out the office that Amy Adams's character would have in the movie they wanted to look at real linguistics offices and the story goes that they went to Jessica's office and Jessica showed them around her office and they made a note that she had like a tea kettle and a cup of tea, so they were like she can have tea, we can have tea for this prof. Which I think is very authentic - a lot of linguists have tea in their offices. But they also wanted an office that had like more stuff in it. So Jessica took them upstairs to Lisa Travis's office and they looked around Lisa's office and they also took inspiration from that office. Lisa has been a prof for longer and she has more books around and she has more papers and more stuff in her office. So they rented some books from Jessica but they also rented some books from Lisa because Jessica didn't have enough books."
3,47,Lauren,i mean there are a lot of books in that office.
3,48,Gretchen,They rented the books by the foot.
3,49,Lauren,By the foot!
3,50,Gretchen,"Yeah, they rented the books by the foot and they really wanted to rent the blue and cream books that Lisa had."
3,51,Lauren,It was impressively uncluttered for an academic office
3,52,Gretchen,"Yeah I think they kind of struck a medium between Jessica's office and Lisa's office. Because Jessica's office is also very clean, very neat and uncluttered. And so I think they kind of struck a medium between there. But the way the shelves are formed looks a lot like McGill shelves"
3,53,Lauren,Right so you feel very homely when you see that scene.
3,54,Gretchen,Yeah! Ben Zimmer did a post on Language Log talking to Lisa and Jessica and Morgan about the office design decisions so we can link to that in the description as well.
3,55,Lauren,Another thing that they put a lot of effort into was designing the language Heptapod B which is the beautiful circular writing system. Someone said it looks like a coffee stain from a mug and I haven't really been able to get that image out of my head. But that logographic writing system is actually a functional constructed script as far as i'm aware.
3,56,Gretchen,"it has pieces to it. Like it has different specific parts that mean specific things and this was one of the other things that they got Jessica Coon to do. They sent her a bunch of printouts of this script and they said 'Go, analyze it! We're not gonna tell you anything.' And so she kind of marked it up with what she thought different stuff might be doing, to try to figure out like what each part meant without any knowledge of what it was doing and they used that as some of the -- I dunno if they used the exact things that she had marked off herself or if they just used that as a basis for some of the annotations that Louise Banks as the linguist character would do in the film."
3,57,Lauren,I read somewhere the guy who designed the script his son got like really into it and it was his son who designed the analysis program that goes through and looks at the points and does science on it.
3,58,Gretchen,"So there were two things. There was the like artistic designer who designed the script and then there were the analyst people who did the physics and computer programs. So, i don't remember the name of the script designer but I know it was like the production designer's wife or something and they keep referring to her as the wife and not with her name which is annoying to me. So I don't know her name but we'll try to link to her. She's a graphic designer who made the script and then it was Wolfram -- I think Stephen Wolfram and his son who did the math and physics-y side and they wrote an active computer program to analyze bits of the script and put it together."
3,59,Lauren,Yeah
3,60,Gretchen,"There's a moment in the film where she's trying to make a sentence and she picks the part that means human and the part that means arrive or something. She picks, you know, a noun and a verb and something else and she picks these bits and says put these together and it like smushes them together into a round circular thing on the screen. Which is a great computer program. I would love to have this program to do linguistic analysis with."
3,61,Lauren,Yeah it looked really pretty. I love that in days of aliens arriving they can make better linguistics software than we've had in like 10 years
3,62,Gretchen,And we're still using praat.
3,63,Lauren,We're still using Praat. I'm going to link to Praat in the notes
3,64,Gretchen,"Oh yeah, please do"
3,65,Lauren,Just because the logo is amazing. Someone drew it in Paint like in the nineties.
3,66,Gretchen,I believe that.
3,67,Lauren,And it's just stayed that way. It's pretty adorably hideous.
3,68,Gretchen,Yeah so in the meantime the military has this money to write a whole computer program in ten days.
3,69,Lauren,"One thing we've not even touched on yet is the cornerstone of the emotional journey of the film which is that in working with these aliens and figuring out their language and learning to use it, it changes the way Amy Adams's character perceives time. Time stops being a linear construction for her. Really, if you got this far through the podcast you deserve to have that plot point spoiled if you haven't seen it yet."
3,70,Gretchen,"It's also in the short story. So I walked in already knowing it and I still got a lot out of the movie. So at the beginning of the film we see a short montage of her with a child you know having a baby and the child growing up and then the child ultimately dying at quite a young age - I think around 11 - of some terrible illness. And so I think people are supposed to assume that this has already happened before the events of the movie even start. Because we see her with a child, but we don't see each a father for the child. So we just see her daughter. And then as she starts decoding the alien language she starts getting what we think are flashbacks but in the end are actually flash-forwards into her life with the child. And at the end she makes the decision that, yes, she's gonna go ahead and get with this guy, even though she knows that it's going to end up in divorce and separation and then ultimately the child dying. So she decides that the good points of that are worth the sad points."
3,71,Lauren,"So that's something in terms of the emotional journey that is something quite different between the film and the short story because in the short story she says very clearly even though I knew exactly what was going to happen and how events were going to unfold I felt completely uncompelled to— I mean, I guess it's the same in the short story and the film but in the short story it's not made clear that she and her husband get divorced because she tells him or he figures out that she knows something about the future. it's just how events go. Sometimes when films dabble in that kind of stuff from a short story or a story you really like you can feel a bit cheated but I thought it was done really well."
3,72,Gretchen,"Yeah, I think mostly it was done very well. It turned into a meditation on choice and free will and whether moments of joy are worth moments of suffering or if you had the chance to change your fate would you?"
3,73,Lauren,Yeah I know he has a name but I can only think of him as Hawkeye so it's Louise Banks hooks up with Hawkeye.
3,74,Gretchen,I think he's technically Jeremy Renner but we can keep calling him Hawkeye.
3,75,Lauren,Ok good.
3,76,Gretchen,And the character is Ian. So Louise Banks hooks up with Ian. Amy Adams with...
3,77,Lauren,Hawkeye.
3,78,Gretchen,I was expecting his character to be a lot more annoying because they kind of set him up as like this douchey scientist at the beginning and then he just became a foil for her to like say her ideas and I was fine with that.
3,79,Lauren,It's really nice for a guy to be the ditzy eye candy I'm completely okay with that
3,80,Gretchen,"I don't really think of Jeremy Renner as eye candy but it was really nice to have a female character be just kind of compelling. It wasn't that she was like sexualized she's just there being a scientist. Ok so there's this one bit which i think is a big linguist quibble part of the story where his character says to her character 'You think of language like a mathematician.' The thing that I found very unrealistic is that she does not say, 'Um, yeah, obviously.'"
3,81,Lauren,"Yeah there are a few times we're you're just like 'If she was a real linguist she'd just be like ""Uh yes, of course, that is obviously what I do.'"
3,82,Gretchen,"Like, 'Oh my god, seriously this is literally what linguistics is.' But i get that she wasn't supposed to be like a smart mouthing, wisecracking person. There's another moment in the film where she uses this analogy of the kangaroo story. So the military guy is saying 'Why do we need to learn learn basic verbs and nouns? Why can't we just ask them why are they here?' And she's like, 'Look, we have to build up to that and we have to understand their response. Because when Captain Cook was arriving in Australia he asked one of the Australians 'What is this?' and the person said 'kangaroo' which it turns out just means 'I don't know'.' So what I've heard is that this was a line in the script that Jessica Coon looked at and she's like, 'This story is false.' But the producers were like, 'Well, we still want to have the story in because it makes this point really well.' And so what they did is they added in a line where the military guy would leave and then physicist guy would be like, 'Great story!' and she'd be like 'Yeah, it's false.' That turned into kind of a laugh line for the audience."
3,83,Lauren,"Actually, it annoyed me because the line was, 'It's probably not true.' And the actual reality is it's definitely not true. It was a language that wasn't spoken near Sydney. There's a long and now better documented history."
3,84,Gretchen,"Good. Yeah so the original version of the script had her play that story straight as if it was true and then it's because of Jessica as the linguist consultant because she was like, 'this story is false' that they added in the second part."
3,85,Lauren,"Excellent she did a good job. And of course just as i was feeling good and smug that they got that right, the military dude then turns around and says all this bullshit about-- I can't remember what the line was but I was so angry at the time.'"
3,86,Gretchen,"I think it was like ""they got wiped out by a superior race' or 'they nearly got wiped out by a superior society' or something like that. And it's supposed to be an analogy that maybe the aliens are coming to wipe out humanity. But it turns into saying that the colonizers were superior for wiping out the Australians. And thaaaaaaaat's not great"
3,87,Lauren,"Yeah, did not sit very well with me. So I did talk about this on Twitter after I saw the film, and I've had a few people be like 'Maybe they did that knowingly' or 'But the black guy said it' which was definitely not my favorite suggestion for why it was ok. Yeah I don't think they did it knowingly and that was quite an annoying line to toe."
3,88,Gretchen,And I think you could make a similar point without making a line that's quite that bad
3,89,Lauren,"Yeah like, if she was a real linguist she would definitely have gone to town on him for that."
3,90,Gretchen,"Yeah, because real linguists care about the well-being of minority language communities and defend them."
3,91,Lauren,"Yeah. So the nonlinear time that Louise starts perceiving is, as we said, key to the plot and the twist in the whole film. And that idea in the film and in the short story is inspired by something that people have been talking about in linguistics for quite a while now and that's the theory of linguistic relativity."
3,92,Gretchen,"And the reason that the alien language causes her to perceive time differently because it's written nonlinearly. So the linguistic relativity I think we agreed that it's a satisfying emotional journey, but from a technical standpoint it just seems really really unlikely that learning another language is going to completely alter your sense of what past and future is. But then again this is a film about aliens."
3,93,Lauren,Yeah and who knows maybe there was some weird special mind-altering gas in the chamber and it wasn't really a linguistic influence it turns out to be some neurotoxin influence. That's what I'm putting my money on. You want to really reanalyze that environment she was in.
3,94,Gretchen,"Maybe it was a neurotoxin. I mean, I think the film is trying to set up the point that it's the language, because they talk about the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis and they talk about this idea that language can affect how you perceive the world. And I think that's the point that the film is trying to make. But i don't think we as an audience have to believe that this is a real thing that happens any more than we believe in time travel paradoxes or heptapod aliens existing in the first place."
3,95,Lauren,Linguistic relativity is an entire field of academic inquiry and I don't want to reduce it to a pithy line. My feeling with it is that the effects that we've seen that exists to suggest linguistic relativity is a thing are usually deeply embedded in culture and language acquisition and other factors that are hard to tease apart. And they often tend to be effects that can be negated through a small amount of metalinguistic awareness and a bit of training in a certain paradigm to kind of counteract any effect.
3,96,Gretchen,"And it can be quite subtle. One example of something that has been shown for weak versions of linguistic relativity is that if your language says that two particular shades are part of the same colour, you'll tend to treat them similarly whereas if it says that they're part of different colours then you'll treat them differently. So if your language has different words for light blue and dark blue. Which English doesn't, but Russian does and Italian does, you'll tend to treat those two colours as different -- the way English-speakers treat pink and red as different colours. I don't think it means that we're physically incapable of perceiving the difference between different reds, because obviously we do this all the time. It's just that it kind of facilitates our thinking in a particular direction, because we're used to associating one group of things versus another group of things. So the linguistic relativity effects that you get tend to be very small and tend to be in the direction of other types of cultural associations and cultural priming. So there's an analogy that John McWhorter uses, which is if you feel more serious in a tuxedo than you feel in a clown suit, that doesn't mean that the clown suit is affecting your thoughts. It means you have these associations with what wearing a red nose and big shoes and like a multicoloured wig is, that are different from your associations with wearing a tuxedo."
3,97,Lauren,Yeah it's a good way to put it.
3,98,Gretchen,"One thing that I found interesting about the interviews with the movie creators is that they were really proud of themselves for having gotten the words 'nonlinear orthography' into a Hollywood movie because that's kind of technical. But this idea is that the alien language, at least the written one, is produced in such a way that you have to know what the whole sentences is, as it's kind of spurting out of your inkblots sort of way. So because the aliens are producing language non-linearly they're also thinking non-linearly about the whole world. And i don't know if I buy this connection. I think that was one of the weak points to me that the alien language would truly be nonlinear because it just looks to me like it's written in a circle but it still has like parts to it."
3,99,Lauren,Yeah I definitely had more weavy visualization when i read the short story it's more about the kind of meshing together of different bits.
3,100,Gretchen,"In the short story i got the idea that— so let's say you have a sentence in Heptapod that's like 'I see the dog' so you know three words, ostensibly. And that the part that meant 'dog' might exist in like five different spots."
3,101,Lauren,Yeah
3,102,Gretchen,And the part that meant 'see' might exist in five different spots so that it would be kind of distributed
3,103,Lauren,"Yeah, weavy. Partly this is the case because it would be truly difficult for humans to come up with a very very very nonlinear language and so we end up just doing the linear language but putting it in a circle."
3,104,Lauren,if people liked this film what else could they see or read to tickle their linguist interest or their linguistics sci fi interest.
3,105,Gretchen,I think my top recommendation for people who liked Arrival would be Embassytown and this is a book by China Mieville -- I dunno how you pronounce that person's name actually.
3,106,Lauren,I say China Mieville
3,107,Gretchen,"I don't know how to pronounce French words in English I just speak too much French. So this is a book, it's sci-fi-ish, it's set on a different planet. There are characters who are responsible for figuring out the language and stuff. It does have this like alien language plus thought thing which is like a fun sci fi thought experiment the same way that faster-than-light travel is a fun sci-fi thought experiment."
3,108,Lauren,"Sci fi that plays around with linguistics tends to come back to linguistic relativity just because it is a really compelling thing to play around with it. So Babel 17 is a book by Samuel Delaney that kind of also plays around with this trope of learning another language liberates your brain from the constraints of these boring and linear human languages. But in a much more classically sci-fi kind of way. Like Snow Crash is also quite similar. Snow Crash is definitely Neal Stephenson and that's more of the neuro linguistic programming. Susette Haden Elgin's Native Tongue is another book that has linguistic relativity as a central theme but also looks at this kind of through language and gender and she created a constructed language around which the plot in her book is based and you can learn that language independent of reading the book and the book is kind of the world in which the languages is used and used as a tool to change the way people think. So that's another possible read. Otherwise, just reading the original short story by Ted Chiang The Story of Your Life that Arrival is based on."
3,109,Gretchen,"Yeah, I would definitely recommend the short story."
3,110,Lauren,Give a much more nuanced view of the kind of mundane realities of field work rather than the high drama of the film.
3,111,Gretchen,It's less dramatic. It has more fieldwork and more physics in it.
3,112,Lauren,"There are very few sci-fi films where you're like, 'Wow, I'm really glad that the linguistics got a better run than the physics.'"
3,113,Gretchen,"Yeah, yeah! It was refreshing to see more linguistics than physics in the film. I've heard that physicists are also tolerably pleased about it because the physicist nowhere wears a white coat ."
3,114,Lauren,Right
3,115,Gretchen,And doesn't like sit in the lab with coloured beakers and pour one into the other.
3,116,Lauren,It's done amazing things for geeks everywhere.
3,117,Gretchen,"There's quite a good interview on -- what's it called, television versus science, I think -- it's a new YouTube channel that did an interview with a bunch of different creators including Jessica Coon and Amy Adams and the real physicists in this and so they talked about physics representation as well. But I think one of the things that's really exciting for linguists about this film is that there have been language-related short stories and novels that play with linguistics ideas. But if you look at the pantheon of linguistic cinema I mean, what is there Lauren, there's like My Fair Lady and Star Trek."
3,118,Lauren,That's about it.
3,119,Gretchen,"So in My Fair Lady you have Henry Higgins who is a phonologist. He does analyze different dialects, he can tell where someone's from based on how they talk, which is moderately realistic. But he's also kind of a jerk."
3,120,Lauren,He is very a jerk. The whole thing is deeply uncomfortable about class and power and gender.
3,121,Gretchen,"Yeah, he's really pretentious and snobbish about the 'right' way of speaking English and training the flower girl Eliza Doolittle into speaking 'correctly' so that she can get a job et cetera et cetera. He's also a misogynist. He's not a very pleasant guy! And so having that be the linguist that's the best-known movie linguist is-- you know, Amy Adams's character Louise Banks is a vast improvement over that."
3,122,Lauren,"Definitely. Before we wrap up, what is your geekiest thought about the film?"
3,123,Gretchen,I'm gonna let you go first.
3,124,Lauren,"From an interactional and cognitive perspective, by far the weirdest thing about the aliens, the Heptapods, is that they didn't point. They had seven bloody hands! Tentacle, finger things. The closest you get it when they tap on the glass to let her know that the bomb is about to go off and then they splat on the glass but there's no pointing. You know, we don't have many things we feel comfortable saying are like universal hallmarks of human communication but we've yet to find a human society where people don't point or understand pointing. It may vary between cultures in terms of frequency and whether people use certain fingers all their lips or whatever. But pointing and being able to perceive what a point means seems to be a fundamental part of human cognition -- and can be used by a variety of other animals. It's one of the ways that domesticated dogs are different from wolves apparently, is that dogs are much better at following pointing."
3,125,Gretchen,"Ok, so you think if we were to meet an intelligent species it would have to understand pointing"
3,126,Lauren,"No, I just think it would have made those interactions that we didn't see because there were some nice montages-- trying to figure out exactly what things were you know Louise and Ian point at themselves and they're like 'Louise, I'm Louise' but the the creatures don't point at themselves."
3,127,Gretchen,Yeah that's true
3,128,Lauren,So it's not clear if they understand pointing or if they don't understand pointing and they figured it out some other way. But yeah that was definitely my hmmm moment.
3,129,Gretchen,I think my geekiest thing was wondering why... So we do see later in the film there's this kind of time travel paradox. Not quite time travel but like future flash-forward paradox where she learns information in the future that she needs in the past.
3,130,Lauren,Yeah
3,131,Gretchen,"So in that case if the heptapods know that in 3,000 years they're gonna need the assistance of humanity, then presumably they already actually understand human language. At least some parts of human language or some of the human languages, maybe not English. But like they're walking in and it's not a monolingual fieldwork situation for them it's only a monolingual fieldwork situation for the human."
3,132,Lauren,Well maybe it would have been utterly impossible if they didn't have that.
3,133,Gretchen,"Yeah, so maybe this is what made it possible right? When Louise says 'humans' and it turns out they give her a logogram that means 'human' they can only do that because they actually do understand what she says. So this is what makes the the fast montage of 10 days actually realistic. Because if you were an actual fieldworker doing this with no language in common you'd have a bunch of false starts. Where you'd to assume they were saying 'human' but they were actually saying their word that meant 'person' or something like that. Or maybe they don't make a distinction between 'human' and 'person' maybe their words for those are the same. There's a bunch of different potential ambiguities that you could have. So maybe this is what makes the 10-day fieldwork situation possible."
3,134,Lauren,But you just think that if they are able to perceive time like that then why not just turn up with a phrasebook ready to go?
3,135,Gretchen,"Yeah! Why not show up with a dictionary? Like, 'hey, here guys, we made you some flashcards!' Or 'we're just gonna talk English like the aliens in Star Trek.' The reason that I came to after thinking about this for a while was that maybe what they wanted was-- they didn't just want to be able to talk to humanity, they wanted to be able to influence. First of all, they needed to be able to teach humans their language and you make a better case for learning the language if it seems like the aliens can't speak yours. Because the point is they wanted to be able to make the humans see the future as well and so on and so forth. And secondly, that they wanted to screen for a very particular type of person to be their primary contact -- they wanted to screen for a linguist or at least someone who cares about communication and can figure out how to do this sort of monolingual fieldwork elicitation and isn't just a military person who's going to run in there with guns ablaze. So they wanted to have a more meditative experience with the humans where they they were able to to talk back and forth more. That was the conclusion I ultimately came to but it did make me wonder.

4,1,Gretchen,Welcome to Lingthusiasm! A podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics. I'm Gretchen McCulloch.
4,2,Lauren,"and I'm Lauren Gawne. And today we're going to be talking about the Word of the Year. But first, since we did our last podcast, we've gone live, and it's very exciting!"
4,3,Gretchen,"It's more exciting for us maybe, because we've been keeping it a secret for a long time and now we get to see it all. We're not talking to an imaginary audience."
4,4,Lauren,We're talking to real people and real people who have been listening! It's amazing. Thank you all so much.
4,5,Gretchen,"And there are so many more of you than we expected and your comments have been so much more than we've been expecting as well -- there have been more of them and they have been nicer than we expected. I don't know, we weren't expecting mean comments but we weren't expecting this many nice comments either so thank you for that."
4,6,Lauren,So I feel like we're doing a real podcast now because I get to say to people 'if you like this then go to iTunes and leave a positive review' and that just makes me feel like I really am doing a podcast now that I have to beg for likes.
4,7,Gretchen,"We've levelled up. And you should also know that we're doing transcripts of the episodes. So if you are not a person who likes listening to things, um, I don't know how you got this far, but if you know people who don't like listening to things, you can send them to our transcripts which are also on our website at lingthusiasm dot com."
4,8,Lauren,"And we also have a Twitter and Facebook. We're pretty chatty really, unsurprisingly."
4,9,Gretchen,"We're pretty chatty and also on other platforms like Google Play Music and youtube, if you're really not a podcast person and SoundCloud. So if you don't do iTunes don't worry we're there too.[Theme music]"
4,10,Lauren,"So, Gretchen, you were at the Linguistics Society of America annual conference and as part of that the American Dialect Society run their annual Word of the Year vote. They have it at the start of January so it definitely encompasses all of the possible 2016 word-time and it's a big vote. You have been to the last few and you were there for this one this year, right?"
4,11,Gretchen,"That is correct!So, we were in a big ballroom in the Marriott in Austin, Texas where the whole conference is being held. If you can picture it, I'm trying to describe this for you, you can picture a big conference ballroom with a couple hundred people in it. I didn't do a count, there were a lot of them, it was standing room only. Big, packed conference room, probably like for 400, 500 people in this ballroom. And what we do is on Thursday we nominate words for a bunch of different categories for Words of the Year. And then on the Friday night we vote for those categories. There are short, 30 second speeches from the floor in support or against particular words in those categories or to nominate a new thing. And then Friday we also take nominations and vote for the actual final overall word of the year. Sometimes that percolates up from the other categories, sometimes it's a new candidate, depends on the year."
4,12,Lauren,So it's all kind of a combination of like structure and tradition and kind of free-form chaotic fun.
4,13,Gretchen,"It's a lot of fun! It's got a certain structure to it. We always have a limited amount of time because that's just how conferences work, and so in the past all the years that I've been at it's chaired by Ben Zimmer, who stands in front of the mic and tries to keep us moving along and and counts votes and then he has a bunch of vote talliers. So voting is by show of hands and there's a vote tallier for each section of people, who walk down the rows and count the people in their sections. So they report back to Ben, you can just watch all this happen, they report back to Ben and then you have Grant Barrett on the slides and so he writes down those numbers and you can see him project it up there. Grant is generally in a word document projected up onto the screen and so he takes down those notes and also makes whatever snarky comments come into his head when he feels like it on the slides (which is fairly often) so that's a lot of fun."
4,14,Lauren,"So it's like a meta commentary happening on the slides. And then there's a whole other kind of dialogue happening on Twitter. So for those of us that don't make it to LSA every year, there's hanging out on the WOTY hashtag which we'll put a link to in the show notes because there was lots of great tweeting happening around it and it meant that even for those who weren't there we got to feel like we we're kind of participating."
4,15,Gretchen,"Yeah, there's also the hashtag, which is always confusing for people because it's WOTY16 because the sixteen refers 2016 the previous year, whereas the LSA's hashtag is LSA2016 because that's LSA happening in the current year."
4,16,Lauren,LSA2017?
4,17,Gretchen,"17! See, even I got this wrong, because it's whatever, what year are we in!? So there's those parallel conversations happening in the hashtags, there's also conversations in the WOTY hashtag up to a month or two before, because bloggers will start proposing their candidates for words of the year making their blog post with recommendations. And people in general will just be posting in the hashtag saying 'this is what I think would be a good thing'. People who can't make it but normally come will be nominating stuff and sometimes people get picked up by other people to say there's a buzz around this and I'm going to nominate it so there's kind of these advance and parallel conversations that happen on the hashtag as well."
4,18,Lauren,I put my nominations on the hashtag a couple of weeks before the event which was really fun because then I felt vaguely invested in the discussion.
4,19,Gretchen,"Yeah, last year I wrote an opinion piece about why singular 'they' should win and it did win so I felt very proud, although I'm sure I can't take complete credit for it because it was also kind of--"
4,20,Lauren,But you did campaign for last year's winner.
4,21,Gretchen,"Yeah it was kind of zeitgeist-y of the year, there had been a lot of talk about it and so I was happy to campaign for it. This year I was campaigning to keep the emoji of the year category in."
4,22,Lauren,"Maybe we should talk about the categories in general. The American Dialect Society Word of the Year discussion is pretty elaborate because they have categories for different types of words and those categories shift and change every year, some of them have been around for a long time, some of them kind of come and go, and last year you got an emoji category up."
4,23,Gretchen,"Yeah, so the Word of the Year categories are kind of a way of focusing conversation around particular types of things that come up a fair bit and a way of recognizing that there are often a whole bunch of words that are interesting in a given year and kind of having a more focused discussion about that rather than just having a giant list of 20 and having to pick a single word from that. Some of the categories include a euphemism of the year, most useful, most likely to succeed, most creative. These categories have been around for quite a while and there's often different types of domains in those categories. But I was actually part of a subcommittee to change some of those categories because we have had in the past had categories like most unnecessary and the least less likely to succeed and most outrageous and those are kind of weird because if you know the words unlikely to succeed why are we even voting for it? So sometimes for most outrageous or most unnecessary, we would get into this this discussion whether the word itself was unnecessary, or if the concept itself was outrageous, which was which. So those had turned out kinda weird, so we abolished the 'least' categories, least likely to succeed and most unnecessary for this year and we added a couple new topic based ones, like politics word of the year and digital word of the year and slang word of the year to bring stuff back into domains rather than the idea of necessity. I think that was relatively effective definitely a bit easier to vote on then trying to determine whether something is outrageous."
4,24,Lauren,"Yeah because one person's like, 'this is a word I've been using for years, it's completely fine' whereas another person is, 'oh my gosh how could you even say that?'"
4,25,Gretchen,"It also depends because the room itself is made up of anybody from the Linguistics Society of America conference that wants to attend and so it's got kind of a mix, it's got linguists but it's got grad students, it's got senior professors, it's got undergrads a few of them come, it's a bit of a mix. And sometimes you get someone saying, 'I've never heard of any of these words!' But you look at them and you think, 'Well, I don't know how exposed you are to newer words.' So it also depends on kind of where people are coming from that's why it's a vote I guess."
4,26,Lauren,"Yeah and it's quite a discussion, right."
4,27,Gretchen,"Yeah, it's quite a discussion. And you know in a room full of a couple hundred people the speeches from the floor have to be quite short -- it's a 30-second limit -- but it does turn into quite a lively discussion."
4,28,Lauren,So someone mentioned something about clicking this year?
4,29,Gretchen,"Yeah, so one of the things that was new about the vote this year was that sometimes when someone would make a really good point in a little speech from the floor, a bunch of people would snap their fingers, you would get kind of a wave of finger-snapping across the room. I thought that was kind of interesting, it's something that hadn't happened in previous years. I think a couple people started doing it and then they would pop up when someone made a point. So that was kind of a good straw poll way of getting a sense of how much the room agreed with someone or disagreed with someone."
4,30,Lauren,Is that a thing from something that I don't know?
4,31,Gretchen,"I'm aware of it as a way to express agreement with someone like you can say 'snaps for this person' or do a couple fingers snaps, snap, snap, so you can snap your fingers to indicate agreement I've been aware of it for probably like 10 years by now? So it's a thing for some people."
4,32,Lauren,"This kind of brings me to another point. Because I mean that's not a thing I'm familiar with but maybe it's a thing that happens in North America. But we currently have an Australian and Canadian talking about the American Dialect Society Word of the Year, how has that happened? Because this is one of the biggest and it gets a lot of press in the days after the vote and it's taken as one of the -- not definitive but we'll talk about in a bit like, there's a whole bunch of different dictionaries that give their word of the year -- but the American Dialect Society vote is one of the biggest events, why is that do you think?"
4,33,Gretchen,"I think it's partly because it's the oldest event so they've been doing Word of the Year since 1998, it was founded by Allan Metcalf. He's still around, he still comes to all the votes but he's passed the emceeing torch to Ben Zimmer. So it's the oldest of the Word of the Year events that I think anybody's aware of. And the conference is conveniently timed for early January. So for example the Canadian Linguistics Association conference, which I have been to, meets in May and it's kind of weird to select a word of the year in May and it's also much smaller. So I think it's considered a large group of linguists but there are some weird elements to it. Another weird element-- so I'm kind of a fan of the age range because I think having a few older people in the room help keep us from getting too trendy and having younger people in the room helps keep us with the trendy words. So I think the age range of the balance and the gender range of linguists tends to be fairly good, but there are more white people in linguistics and in academia in general than there are in the population at large, so I don't think we're totally representative there."
4,34,Lauren,"Right, and from reading Twitter there was a bit of discussion around, and there seems to be every year, around the fact that in some of the categories you get a lot of words that come from African-American varieties of English. By time white girl Australian-in-England Lauren hears them they're like so filtered through many layers of popular culture, but there's this tension it seems between taking these words or borrowing them or there seems to be something a little bit awkward about the American Dialect Society's relationship with some of these words. Would you say that's something that's reflected in the event?"
4,35,Gretchen,"Yeah, I think the American Dialect Society's relationship with these words is a reflection of our broader society's relationship with these words. So African-Americans get stigmatized for themselves speaking African- American English or themselves speaking in ways that differ from what we consider educated English, what we consider mainstream English, and can get penalized on the job market and stuff like that. And yet suddenly some of these words get adopted as cool and and become popular when they weren't as popular in the mouths of the original people that were saying them and so I think justifiably that's not fair. I think the American Dialect Society Word of the Year vote can in some cases reflect that words for African-American English get brought into mainstream society -- they get picked up in places like BuzzFeed, they get picked up by white celebrities, and white suburban teenagers and things like this. I think this is a process that does happen and in a sense the vote is chronicling things that do happen, so it's not necessarily inappropriate for the American Dialect Society to be reflecting that. But also to be making sure to reflect that these words have a longer history and have a longer context and that we owe them to the people that originally came up with them. And that you can't just talk about them as if they started in 2016 or in a particular year without that context before that."
4,36,Lauren,"Okay, that makes sense."
4,37,Gretchen,"I think that the long-term solution is, when you look at how words get borrowed from one language to another or one culture to another, they often reflected the existing power relationships that exist between those cultures. So words get borrowed between English and French but this isn't as fraught because English and French have had a relatively egalitarian power relationship through history, but that's not true for all of the words that have been borrowed into English. Whether that's from African-Americans or whether that's from indigenous peoples, or other people whose history has been erased as their words have been borrowed, those histories can be more fraught. And I think the least we can do is acknowledge that and give them credit for their linguistic creativity when we're doing that, but ultimately the way to make the power relationships less weird around those words being borrowed is to make those power relations be less weird in society in general."
4,38,Lauren,And I feel like that's why I really appreciate the Twitter feed that happens around the World of the Year because I get a much more diverse kind of perspective on these words and how people feel about them I feel like that kind of helps influence my awareness about words and their history especially from groups that I'm not in regular contact with.
4,39,Gretchen,"I will say as someone who has been at the voting for a number of years, there are a number of people who make these points in the speeches from the floor during the voting as well. And I think they often sway the audience towards or against particular words based on what's going on there, pointing out the history of these words. It's a bit tricky with the nomination process to trace the full history of these words as they're being nominated in the same hour that we're doing the voting, so some of that history taking happens afterwards."
4,40,Lauren,Fair enough.
4,41,Gretchen,"But I think continuing to point this out, continuing to point out that just because a word hits prominence in The New York Times, say, doesn't mean it's actually new that particular year, it may have a ten-year-old or 50 year old history among different group of people that we need to recognize."
4,42,Lauren,"I mean we talked about this with singular they and the pronouns episode, that it has a history that spans centuries, it's just that it felt like it was being talked about and that the time was right for it."
4,43,Gretchen,"Yeah, so the criteria for especially the American Dialect Society Word of the Year is not necessarily new, but 'newly prominent'. Because the year in which a word is new it's often that nobody really notices at all and so it's when it feels prominent. In practice, the way that gets enforced is when a word that has been nominated before gets nominated again, Ben Zimmer will just say 'Oh yeah, we had that word back in this year' because he somehow seems to know all of these."
4,44,Lauren,He's a Word of the Year oracle.
4,45,Gretchen,Basically if it hasn't been nominated before then it's fair game and somehow Ben Zimmer just knows all of the words that have ever been nominated.
4,46,Lauren,Useful man to have around.
4,47,Gretchen,Yes he's very useful!
4,48,Lauren,We haven't even talked about the winner yet of the American Dialect Society Word of the Year!
4,49,Gretchen,"That's true we haven't talked about the winner! So the overall winner, in case you somehow missed this, the overall winner was dumpster fire which can also optionally be expressed as an emoji with the wastebasket and the fire emoji but we did vote for it in its conventional English orthography. I think partly people felt like that was a very good word to sum up what 2016 had been and also how people have been talking about 2016 in terms of all of the bad things that had happened that year."
4,50,Lauren,Yeah so it was my nomination in my three weeks before the vote tweet so I feel--
4,51,Gretchen,congratulations!
4,52,Lauren,--very smug that I am of the zeitgeist.
4,53,Gretchen,You are on trend!
4,54,Lauren,"None of my specific category votes were correct, I'll put them in the show notes, but my Word of the Year was the one that won. Awkwardly though, my super backward Android phone doesn't have the wastepaper basket in my emoji library so I can't even emoji tweet the Word of the Year which is a bit of a tech fail."
4,55,Gretchen,If you copy paste it from somewhere.
4,56,Lauren,"I could, but it's getting very elaborate by that point. So it kind of was a dual win, so the word is the Word of the Year but people are also using the emoji as well."
4,57,Gretchen,"People are also using the emoji as well. I think there was some discussion about whether the wastebasket is a very good dumpster because obviously those are quite different shapes. I think initially, at least when I had started using the wastebasket + fire, I had been using to stand for trash fire or obviously something that means the same thing."
4,58,Lauren,"Which in my dialect is rubbish fire, or bin fire."
4,59,Gretchen,"I would really say garbage fire probably because trash to me reads as American so trash fire or garbage fire, I've been using the wastebasket for which I think is a perfectly reasonable use of the wastebasket. But then of course because dumpster fire is a synonym for that then you get the dumpster fire."
4,60,Lauren,"And there's been some good commentary on it, we'll link to Ben Zimmer's Language Log posts and Nancy Friedman's post on her blog about dumpster fire as the winner."
4,61,Gretchen,I will say that there's also something else that comes up in pretty much every Word of the Year vote is when a word reflects a political idea or an event or particular concept: Is voting for that particular word a political endorsement or is that simply a reflection that a thing has happened even if you don't agree with the fact that that's happened? And that was something that came up especially this year.
4,62,Lauren,Ok so this isn't the American Dialect Society admitting that 2016 was really bad by voting for this word.
4,63,Gretchen,"Well, dumpster fire is comparatively neutral, but if you look at some of the other categories and we look at some of the discussion that happened during that vote, so things like deplorables and nasty women were nominated. There was some discussion about alt-right although don't know if it ended up actually being nominated. And these are certainly words that were used a lot in 2016 but is the nomination of them going to be taken as an endorsement? And in some case it is. That's the thing. So last year when singular they was the one that was selected, I read several articles in the month thereafter saying, 'Well, one of the reasons why you should use singular they, it has a long history, it solves a convenient gender neutrality problem, but also the American Dialect Society has endorsed it.' And so it does have that signalling function."
4,64,Lauren,"Right, and we can't just say, 'Well, it's a positive word so we voted for it as an endorsement and it's a negative word so we voted for it as a warning.'"
4,65,Gretchen,"Yeah, and then the previous year the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter was voted for. And so I think that was again saying this was a significant event that happened in a particular year, but it's also saying the American Dialect Society -- the people who are voting for that particular Word of the Year -- would also like to assert that black lives matter. It's hard to separate the political and social functions of words from simply their descriptive nature even though we would like to do that sometimes as linguists."
4,66,Lauren,"So obviously dumpster fire was the ADS Word of the Year winner, but it seems like every dictionary has its own word of the year. There's words of the year all over the place at the end of the year, it's becoming an increasingly popular sport."
4,67,Gretchen,I mean it's such a good PR opportunity.
4,68,Lauren,"Is this just a PR opportunity, is this why people do this?"
4,69,Gretchen,"I mean, you can't deny that you do get a bit of press out of that and people like reporting on it. There's a bit of a sense I think among various dictionaries and other groups, that places try to choose different words of the year. Because if you pick the same word of the year as someone else then you're not as interesting from a reporting side, or you're not making your own statement. So I think that there was a widespread expectation that Oxford dictionaries was going to choose Brexit because they're--"
4,70,Lauren,--because they're the British one.
4,71,Gretchen,And then when they didn't maybe that freed up Collins Dictionary to choose Brexit.
4,72,Lauren,"Oxford Dictionary chose post truth for anyone who's interested, we'll link to all these."
4,73,Gretchen,"And they also pick different methodologies for choosing their words of the year. So the American Dialect Society has this big vote and at that point we're aware of what everyone else has chosen so there's often a bit of a tendency to not bother so much with already-chosen words. And the American Dialect Society vote specifically focuses on new words, whereas several of the other dictionaries -- because they have statistics and what people have been looking up a lot -- they often focus on the words that have had a particular spike that year or that have been looked up more often than normal and go for that. Those different methodologies will also tend to lead them to different words. Dictionary.com, for example, because I happened to be talking with Jane Solomon about this, they had a spike in xenophobia around Brexit and I think also around the U.S. election so they were a couple different spikes there. For Merriam-Webster, their word was surreal, and in previous years they've had words like science -- they tend to choose the words that have just an overall high in that given year without particular spikes and that will tend to bias you towards more common words, so that's why you get stuff like surreal and science. So I think partly people try to choose different methodologies to keep it interesting you know, and then if it comes with some PR, I don't think anyone's objecting to that."
4,74,Lauren,The Australian National Dictionary Centre vote for their word of the year and they kind of do an internal office discussion thing and they have shortlist and then they have a winner. I'm very pleased that the 2016 word of the year for the ANDC was democracy sausage.
4,75,Gretchen,So you might need to explain what that is.
4,76,Lauren,"So a democracy sausage -- earliest sources tend to be around 2012 but we had an election in and they were very popular in 2016 -- because we have this great system called compulsory voting. When you vote, which you have to do, afterwards often the local schools and local charities will set up a BBQ out the front and be cooking sausages. This is known as a sausage sizzle and you can buy yourself a sausage in a piece of bread maybe with some tomato sauce and onions and this is the cornerstone of democracy. The thing I was most excited about after I was 18 and I got to vote for the first time was that I got to vote and then I got to go out and have a sausage from the sausage sizzle afterwards. And this year thanks to the wonders of technology people got really into setting up like sausage sizzle finder apps so you could find a really good way to find a democracy sausage after voting."
4,77,Gretchen,"I don't know why all voting booths don't have these in other countries. Like, I would like some democracy sausages in Canada please."
4,78,Lauren,"Yeah, it's just part of it being like an event."
4,79,Gretchen,"That sounds really fun and it's definitely a very Australian word because we don't have them. I looked up to see as the resident Canadian whether anybody had ever declared a Canadian Word of the Year and I'm very disappointed to report that I did not find much. So there was some guy who was declaring Word of the Year for 2009 to 2012 and then just kind of stopped but I think this is something I might need to get going. I might need to get my friends of the Canadian Linguistics Association, I do know many people in the Canadian Linguistics Association, and I might need to get them on that because everybody else gets their PR op but--"
4,80,Lauren,"Yeah, it's Canada's turn."
4,81,Gretchen,"Yeah, it's Canada's turn. So we'll have to see if we can get a Canadian word of the year declared next year. And there are other stuff from other countries though, we're not going to list all the countries but Austria had a particularly interesting word of the year from their election and in my best German -- this word is 51 or 52 letter long, I didn't count, and reports vary -- the Austrian Word of the Year is 'Bundespräsidentenstichwahlwiederholungsverschiebung' and it means something like have a recount of the election, to do the election twice and this is something that apparently happened in Austria this year so people were talking about it a lot."
4,82,Lauren,"There's also a Dutch Sign Language Word of the Year. The Dutch Sign Language Word of the Year is you put your hand flat on your head and then you lift your fingers up kind of 90 degrees and put them back down again which is the Dutch Sign Language sign for Donald Trump. You may be able to figure out where the iconicity for that one comes from. So Dutch Sign Language declared a sign of the year which was pretty cool. [Update: this was actually the Swiss Sign Language word of the year, not the Dutch, sorry about that!]"
4,83,Gretchen,I asked a linguist who works on sign languages if there was an American Sign Language Word of the Year and she said 'Oh no there isn't but that's an interesting idea!' so maybe stay tuned.
4,84,Lauren,2017!
4,85,Gretchen,If there is an ASL Sign of the Year or Auslan Sign of the Year we will be sure to report back.
4,86,Lauren,"Something that people may be wondering by this point in the conversation, having talked about the Dutch sign, the Australian democracy sausage, the dumpster file which is also in emoji form, by the time you get to this point you thinking what even is a word right?"
4,87,Gretchen,Because the word of the year is often a phrase.
4,88,Lauren,Well the Austrian one is basically like a sentence in English.
4,89,Gretchen,"The Austrian would be a sentence in English, well, it would be kind of a compound noun in English, And the previous year singular they wasn't 'they' itself it was the fact that they was being used as singular that was a specific part of the words that we were looking at and yeah this does get us into the question of what even is a word."
4,90,Lauren,"And by time you're kind of done with this you realize that linguists play pretty fast and loose with the definition of words. The unit of the word -- unless you're a dictionary maker or a lexicographer or something really specific like that -- you don't often think about words when you're doing linguistics, weirdly enough."
4,91,Gretchen,"I think the average person thinks about a word as like, something with spaces around it. But that gets really complicated really quickly. So if you think about numbers, 22 when it's written in numerals doesn't have spaces but when it's written in words you can put a space in between it or you can put a dash in between it. And lots of compounds you can put a hyphen there or not put a hyphen there and does that make it two words now? I mean if you're writing an essay for a class and you have a word count ,maybe, but intuitively twenty-two with and without the hyphen mean the same thing so they should be the same word. Or if you take something like website you can write that open as web (space) site or website all together and those should be the same thing. And linguists would say those were the same thing."
4,92,Lauren,"Yeah, so something like dumpster fire or democracy sausage. They're nouns that are made up of other words so we think of them as compound nouns in linguistics. You know, I've kind of come to the point where I just try and tell people the word of the year is like word as in like a single semantic sense that has kind of one label, and maybe that label is a compound noun and sometimes that label as a single word and sometimes that label is an emoji. But language doesn't always just go with the white spaces."
4,93,Gretchen,"Yeah, and the white spaces are themselves artificial because you learn to speak before you learn how to write. And when the words come out of your mouth in a speech stream you're not pausing between every single word the way you need to put white spaces between words when you write them. So 'website' you say without a pause in between it regardless of what you do with the spacing. I think the best quote that I have about what a word is, so it was back when I was teaching, and I had a student that came up to me about halfway through the intro course, and said 'I'm really enjoying this course but the problem is, before taking linguistics I thought I knew what a word was. And now we've been getting into it more I just really have no idea!' And I said, 'Congratulations, you've become a linguist!' Because I would say, I went to a conference a couple years ago which was entirely about words and how they get put together, and someone made a joke to this room of a hundred or so linguists who all work specifically on words, saying, 'Yeah, well, you know, nobody really knows what a word is.' And there was laughing and agreeing. So if you ask group of a linguists what a word is I don't think there's a clear consensus -- it's not clear when you should put spaces and when you shouldn't put spaces. It's clear that there are some things that definitely aren't words and some things that definitely are, but there's a lot of stuff on the margins."
4,94,Lauren,"And that's even only in one language, let alone across the world's languages."
4,95,Gretchen,"So instead of words, linguists tend to talk about units of meaning and units of sound and then you have a morpheme which is some unit of sound that also has a particular meaning. It's very clear that something is or isn't a morpheme, because it has some sort of sound associated with it and has some sort of meaning associated with it. And it doesn't matter whether that morpheme is attached to another morpheme or all by itself as a word, it's still a unified thing to talk about. I've also realized we're talking about what's a word that I collaborated on a video with Tom Scott, who's a YouTuber, about what even is a word and some of the different things that different languages do with different words.We're going to put a link to that video in the show notes if you want to go check that out, and we will also of course be linking to a bunch of different discussions of words of the year.

5,1,Lauren,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics. I'm Lauren Gawne."
5,2,Gretchen,"and I'm Gretchen McCulloch. And today we're going to be talking about colour. But first! I want to point out that all the transcripts for previous episodes are now online so you can check those out. Also: Lauren, what have you been up to lately?"
5,3,Lauren,"I have been in the world of gesture and the world of language data archiving. I've been at iGesto conference in Porto in Portugal, which was a delightful place for a delightful conference. And I've been archiving language data with a couple of projects, one of which is super exciting and I don't want to be one of those people that holds exciting projects over people's heads, but I've been doing some work with 1970s data recordings that's pretty cool and coming along nicely. And of course getting my own data into an archive that will be accessible for other people to look at whether they're speakers of the language or interested in the language or want to do linguistics on it. So that's been my month, how are you?"
5,4,Gretchen,I had a pretty quiet month but at the end of February I'm heading to ICLDC which is the international conference on language documentation and conservation in Hawaii.
5,5,Lauren,"I'm so jealous! I say, having just come back from Porto."
5,6,Gretchen,I am really excited because I've been hearing about the conference for years and I have not made it yet. So this is an international conference about language revitalization and I'm going to be running some workshops on getting your language information on Wikipedia and I'm also really excited to learn more about what other people's projects are that they're working on.
5,7,Lauren,"Awesome. I'm so excited that LingWiki, the linguistics Wikipedia editing thing is having a season in Hawaii The ICLDC conference is so great it has such a good community and I'm sure ICLDC7 will be a hashtag with lots of action on it in late January early March. [Update: the hashtag is actually ICLDC5.]"
5,8,Gretchen,"Yeah, so check out the hashtag, we'll try to tweet something about that, I'm sure I'll be tweeting from my own twitter account on that hashtag. I don't know how much people use hashtags at gesture conferences so maybe check out Lauren's."
5,9,Lauren,Lots.
5,10,Gretchen,"Oh good! OK good, you just have to take photos of the gestures."
5,11,Lauren,"Yeah, I'll add a link in the show notes as well to the iGesto hashtags. That's what Twitter photos are for."
5,12,Gretchen,"Ahhh photos, I forgot about photos.[Theme music]"
5,13,Lauren,"I am so excited that today's topic is colour and language! You may be wondering why we would be interested in talking about colour and language at the same time and that is for a number of reasons. If you take a cross-linguistic perspective you find that there are a variety of ways in which different languages cut up the colour space in order to talk about them, that has some really interesting implications."
5,14,Gretchen,"Yeah, so I guess the simple reason is colours are things that we have words for! But not all languages have the same words for the same colours, so you have a potential visual spectrum of possible colours that exists and languages that carve up that visual spectrum in some ways that are similar in some ways that are different. Lauren, you have a story for us."
5,15,Lauren,"I have, conveniently, two languages that I've learnt at two point in my life illustrate this really neatly. When I was in primary school we were 'taught' - I'll put that in some quote marks - Italian and I still remember in grade five or six you had to describe a face and I wrote, and and this will probably not be grammatical Italian because I'm remembering what eleven-year-old Lauren knew, but I wrote something like 'occhi blu', so that person has blue eyes, 'blu' being the Italian word for blue. And my Italian teacher was like 'meeeeh that's a fine... I mean, I understand what you mean but the person actually has occhi azzurro'. Or there's probably an adjective conjugation there that I need to do that I haven't done but for eyes for this Italian teacher you don't use the word 'blu' you use the word 'azzurro'. And people have argued that Italian actually has two basic colour words for what we think of as blue and 'blu' covers everything that's like royal blue and really rich blues and darker and azzurro is like light blue and sky blue. So I didn't really get it as an eleven-year-old and it's still hard for me to think of this, but then when I started learning Yolmo, which is a Tibetan language spoken in Nepal, they have one word for blue but that word also includes most of what we think of as green. And this is sufficiently common it's not that unusual for languages to have one word that covers everything we describe as blue and green and it's so common that these are often referred to as languages that have a colour 'grue', which is the word I like very much."
5,16,Gretchen,"'Grue' is a portmanteau of 'green' and 'blue', in case anyone needed that explained to them."
5,17,Lauren,"Thanks for explaining that, I think it's good that you've explained it. So you have Italian which creates divisions across what we think of as one colour and a language like Yolmo which covers what we think of as two colours with one word and this is something that happens pretty commonly across the world's languages."
5,18,Gretchen,"Yeah, I mean the the light blue dark/blue things may seem weird to English speakers but if you think of the words for red and pink, where pink is really just a light red and historically English didn't have a word for pink, you can kind of get a sense of it -- imagine if we did the same thing but for blue."
5,19,Lauren,"Yeah, and people had been aware of these differences across languages but the study that's often cited as the thing that kicked off a consistent research agenda in colour terms across languages is a study by Brent Berlin and Paul Kay from the 1970s. Oh, it was actually published in 1969, their monograph. So this was research done in the late sixties and then was really popular and replicated and discussed a lot in the seventies and eighties."
5,20,Gretchen,"I think they did a second study in the seventies and eighties, they did it again, but more broadly. So the bigger one that they get cited on is from the seventies. Anyway, so they decided that they wanted to, the first pilot version of the sixties they got some people or so who spoke some languages that they knew, you kind of wander around your linguistics grad department, find people who speak different languages and ask them about their colour terms. And then they replicated that on a larger scale by sending people out or working with people who are already going out and doing linguistic fieldwork and giving them the box of coloured chips, like paint chips that you get in a store to match your colours and giving them these typewritten instructions. We'll link to those in the show notes if you want to see the original instructions that they send out to people."
5,21,Lauren,And the colour chips that they used specifically known as Munsell chips which doesn't sound very tasty but the thing that's important about Munsell chips is that they are produced with incredibly consistent colours. So whatever is Munsell color 42 is going to be exactly the same across all of the Munsell set so you have this real consistency in the colours they were questioning people about across languages.
5,22,Gretchen,"Yeah, so they sent out people with all these consistent colour chips and they asked them, okay can you get some people who speak whatever language you're working with to sort these chips by groups that all belong to the same colour and by the most basic colour terms? So in English terms you'd be sorting out things like red and blue and even pink but you wouldn't be sorting out sky blue which is a colour term that has a literal word attached to it or bright red vs. dark red. So they were trying to get people to avoid using extra descriptors and just use whatever the most basic set of colour terms was that that language had."
5,23,Lauren,"So English has eleven colour terms I think. Let me see; red, green, yellow, blue, brown, purple, pink, orange, grey - I've only got up to nine, maybe I meant 9."
5,24,Gretchen,I think it has 11.
5,25,Lauren,I missed black and white! There we go.
5,26,Gretchen,There we go!
5,27,Lauren,"Black, white, red, green, yellow, blue, brown, pink, purple, orange, grey. That is actually cross linguistically quite a lot of words, but we can make even broader distinctions if we talk about light blue/ dark blue, warm yellow/cool yellow, off white - these kind of extra descriptors."
5,28,Gretchen,"Yeah and there are a few languages that have more distinctions, Korean apparently has a distinction between yellow and greenish-yellow, which is I think uncommon cross-linguistically, but they do it. It's a little bit weird the fact that English has words for purple and violet which generally people consider basically the same colour, but we do have two quote unquote 'basic' colour terms for it."
5,29,Lauren,"There are also a variety of terms like violet and turquoise and sienna for example, which are considered to not be basics because they're not part of the basic vocabulary that is taught to children, they're more technical terms. They're generally terms from a specific thing so turquoise has that colour because of the colour of turquoise or amethyst you could say that's a nice - I would never say - that's a nice amethyst sweater, but if you wanted to you could, it would be grammatical but it's an extension of the meaning of the colour purple from that stone and it's a sub colour within purple."
5,30,Gretchen,"But if you look back historically some words that we now consider basic English colours at one point were words that were used to refer to a specific object. I'm harping on pink a lot but the word pink originally meant a particular type of flower, a kind of a carnation and was later extended to mean the colour. The word orange started out as the fruit and then became the word for the colour. Even like a word like black in English which is a very basic colour term originally come from a Proto-Indo-European word meaning 'burnt' so you can make these etymological links. I guess it's when speakers become unaware of the etymological links that they really become basic colour terms."
5,31,Lauren,"It blew my mind in undergrad when I learnt that black is historically cognate with a lot of the European terms for white so in other Germanic languages you have something like German 'schwartz', which I definitely didn't say right, and then in all the Italian, French, Spanish languages you have was like 'bianco', 'blanc' or something like that which is cognate with black because black means something that's like burnt or brightly lit."
5,32,Gretchen,Burnt up versus burning brightly.
5,33,Lauren,"Burnt up, there you go. So these terms can change and evolve."
5,34,Gretchen,"English also has words 'blank' and 'blanch', 'bleach', which all come from the same route but refer more to the removing of colour than the the darkening of something, so that's the connection there. And this is one of the things, so what this Kay and Berlin colours survey found is that languages differ with how many basic colour terms they have, somewhere between about 2 and about 12 and that they need to follow at least an approximate trajectory. They have a specified quite a specific path but later research has shown that there are a few more divergences then they noticed. So if a language only has two colour terms they're going to have terms for light and dark."
5,35,Lauren,"I mean it's hard to imagine as an English speaker speaking a language that only has two colour terms. Generally they cover a pretty broad spectrum, so it's not just dark and light it's like the dark and cool colours and these are the light and warm colours. But that's your most minimal set of colour terms."
5,36,Gretchen,"Yeah, and then if you get an additional colour term in that, number three, you're going to end up with kind of the red spectrum, all of the stuff around red so now you have light and dark and red as a distinct thing and then after that things diverge a bit more. Sometimes people's fourth colour is yellow, sometimes it's a green, but those are yellows and greens that also include stuff like blue because remember all the languages that don't split up green and blue. But probably mostly light blues because your dark blues would still end up with black in the dark spectrum."
5,37,Lauren,"And then once you have green and yellow you generally have blue, and after that brown follows and then stage 7 is purple, pink, orange, or grey. so you get more and more sophisticated and nuanced colour terms."
5,38,Gretchen,"Yeah, you get finer variations there but it's hard to imagine there's language that only has three colour terms and those terms are turquoise, orange, and pink."
5,39,Lauren,"Yeah because that's not covering a lot. I mean, it might be covering a lot of the colour space in your wardrobe but not for all speakers."
5,40,Gretchen,"No orange! Turquoise yes, in my wardrobe."
5,41,Lauren,"So it's not surprising that we we're talking about pink and orange and these later stage colours in English have really clear and relatively recent etymologies compared to something like red or green or white. I remember when I learned this stuff in undergrad a friend who I was doing this with was completely-- she just would not believe that you could cover brown, purple, and grey in one colour. She was just like how could you have one lexeme or one word that covers all of those three?? And then one day she came to class and she was so excited and was just like look look at the scarf that I bought! And it was true, you couldn't tell, in certain contexts it looked brown and some context it looked purple and in some contexts it looked grey and that was her, like, theoretical proof those colours were close enough that it made sense to put them in one lexeme."
5,42,Gretchen,"Well the scarf actually brings us into an interesting point about why languages developed colour terms, which is that there's often some relationship between produced goods whether that's dyed fabrics or gemstones or other types of processed goods that people make into specific colours. Because if you're thinking about the sky for example, you know, we say all the time the sky is blue, but it's really not necessary to specify that the sky is blue. You can say the sky is dark or light, the sky is cloudy or clear, and if it's clear and its light of course it's blue! What other colour is it going to be? Or you can say something like the tree is living or the tree is dying, you don't necessarily need to specify the tree is is green or that it's red. So a lot of colours in nature a lot of things only really come in one specific colour. Whereas once you start making cars you don't say this car is ripe or it's not ripe, or this car is cloudy or it's clear, or this dress that you're going to make is ripe or unripe or that this basket that you're weaving is dyed a particular colour. Once you start dying stuff in colours it becomes more useful to talk about a finer variations or if you send someone to buy for you a particular thing in particular colour may want to specify exactly what that colours going be once you start colouring stuff artificially."
5,43,Lauren,So certain technological innovations can give rise to the necessity for finer distinctions and colour terms.
5,44,Gretchen,And some colour terms are etymologically linked to specific things that created those colours so purple is linked to the name of the particular mollusc that was used to make purple dye back around ancient Greece.
5,45,Lauren,The original Berlin and Kay survey has grown because it was really well written as methodology and using the Munsell chips meant that lots of people could get these colour sets and go and test with lots of different people around the world. The World Atlas of Linguistic Structures has a map about the number of colour terms across a large number of languages. They currently have 119 languages in WALS. I don't think we've talked about WALS on the podcast yet somehow.
5,46,Gretchen,"No, so WALS is an acronym for the World Atlas of Linguistic Structure and it is a very cool website you can go look at it yourself at wals dot info, we'll link to that in the description. And you can check out all of these cool maps of different linguistic features as dots on a particular map so in this case you can look at a map that has the red dots as the languages with this many colour terms and the yellow dots as languages with a different number of colour terms and you get kind of a view at a glance. I will say WALS is great and it's a good resource, it's got often a couple hundred languages for a particular feature, but it doesn't have all the languages. There are like 6,000 languages and many of them just don't have the kind of grammars--"
5,47,Lauren,But it's as comprehensive as we've got.
5,48,Gretchen,"Yeah, many of them just don't have the kind of grammars that can be used as input to databases like WALS. So it's very cool resource but it obviously over-represents the languages that we have grammatical descriptions of."
5,49,Lauren,"So there's lots of data on WALS for South American, Central American and kind of central West Africa and Australia and Papua New Guinea for colour terms. And interestingly, the lowest number of colour terms in a language in the WALS survey is three for basic colour terms. Languages with only three include Murrinh-patha in the Northern Territory of Australia, a number of West African languages including Wobe and Dan and then only one that I can see in Southern America which is Campa. I will put a link to the WALS colour maps in the show notes, so you can have a click around on the map and look at all the languages and the distribution of colour terms there."
5,50,Gretchen,"I will say that on the one hand it's very cool that the Kay and Berlin survey has this very standardized side of chips and does allow you to do these cross-linguistic comparisons. But when we were doing some research for this episode, I also came across a paper that pointed out that it can be also useful to look at the colour terms for language in terms of how those group use them specifically to refer to natural objects, sometimes this can illuminate stuff that the very standardized qualitative approach doesn't illuminate. The example that they had was there was a language that made a distinction between light and dark or black and white and then also between reddish-brown and pale green, you think huh that's a bit of a weird distinction to make, maybe, but if you look at how they actually use the words the pale green group was for living, growing things and often wet things, and the reddish-brown group with for dry or desiccated or dying things. So if you cut a stalk of bamboo off and you saw that wet opening of the raw bamboo, that was considered the pale green colour, even though literally speaking it's brown. Whereas if you have a dry leaf which might be the same shade of brown, that's considered the reddish brown colour. So there are pros and cons to doing a very standardized approach I guess."
5,51,Lauren,"Yep and one thing people have criticized it for is this lack of cultural context and specific conversational context. Another thing that's worth talking about in relation to colour terms and how people use language to describe colour is that there aren't just differences across languages, there are also some differences within a language with different groups. There's been a variety of studies looking at this, but we just thought we'd talk about some of the ones we know and find interesting and worth talking about. Some of the first effects that we see is an effect of gender and there's a really great study here from 1977 by Elaine Rich on sex-related differences in colour vocabulary, in which she finds that there is a difference between men and women in terms of how large their colour vocabularies are. Do you want to guess which way that effect goes Gretchen?"
5,52,Gretchen,"I think if you're going to get me to guess that means you're setting me up for something. So generally people assume that women have a larger colour vocabulary than men, are you going to tell me that's not the case?"
5,53,Lauren,"I'm going to tell you it's the case in this study but there are some other factors involved as well. So in the survey that the researcher did which involved a set of 25 colour cards -- I love it, she used the Crayola crayon colours as her focal colours because she wasn't using Munsell chips. And then she surveyed a variety of groups of people and she found that women could use more and more elaborate colour vocabularies than men but there were other complicated factors involved. So for example there was a social class difference and there's also an age difference, so younger men have larger colour vocabularies than older men in her study."
5,54,Gretchen,What was the social class difference?
5,55,Lauren,"The social class was technical vs non technical jobs for younger women in the demographic. She doesn't actually define what a technical job is as far as I can see but there was a professional distinction there. So one of her groups that she studied were a group of Catholic nuns, and these women did score lower in the number of colour terms they used than the other women in her survey. So even within languages there are different factors that indicate how many colour terms a person might use even if the language has a variety of them."
5,56,Gretchen,"I came across the study of I think it was women in Eastern Europe where the age effect that they found was the opposite. The older women had more colour terms and specifically the older women had more colour terms related to traditional dying methodology for textiles, whereas the younger women had become disconnected from traditional dyeing terminology for textiles and could no longer identify words like madder and russet and stuff like this that are used in traditional terms -- they tended to use more industrialised colour terms. There's the famous London cab drivers study which shows that people who have been driving cabs in London for years and years and years and learned all of the little byways in London have developed a really good sense of direction for London, they've got larger hippocampi to give you directions. And I think this seems to be one of those 'if you use it you get more words for it' areas, like with any specialised domain."
5,57,Lauren,"Yeah, there's a professional vocabulary distinction to be made there as well. I do remember reading something, and again we're into uncited anec-data here, but I do remember reading something that said professionals can discriminate with more lexical items and words, like technical words, but it doesn't necessarily mean they see more colours than people who don't have these professional words. So you might give people colour chips and one is magenta and one is russet, and people might say well they're both within red. And someone who does fabric work will know that's magenta and that's russet someone who doesn't have to discriminate will be like well this one's rustier and this one's richer red, and so they can still see the difference. It's not like not having the word prevents you. And you know, people who I'm friends with in Nepal who predominantly speak a language that doesn't have a blue-green distinction, they still see the distinction, they still prefer fabric in one colour over another one. So we're not saying anything about it affecting the way people literally see colour. I'm also going to put a link in the show notes to Randall Munroe of XKCD's colour survey from 2010. Results relatively similar to those found by Rich in the seventies except he had a few more data points. He had people labelling colours on their computers, so there's a monitor effect here, but he had almost a quarter of a million users logged on to label five million colours. So a few more data points there. There's more distinction for some colours among people who have identified in the survey as female compared to those who identify as male. It was the same set of focus colours though, so you know everyone agreed that red was red and pink was pink in the brightest shades of those, and everyone agreed that no one can spell 'fuchsia'. So it was a pretty successful study."
5,58,Gretchen,"That's a good thing to be aware of, I can't spell fuchsia."
5,59,Lauren,I cannot spell fuchsia. So I'll put a link to those in the note as well. [Update: thanks to spellcheck for spelling fuchsia for us in the transcript!]
5,60,Gretchen,"There's also been an interesting post by Kory Stamper on her blog. She's an editor at Merriam Webster, and the post is talking about the history of defining colour terms in the dictionary. Because especially before we had computers, when you're making a paper dictionary of course it's going to be printed in black and white. You can't just define a colour the way an interior designer might with like 'here's your swatch.' You have to give some sort of a description. For complex colour terms, like fuchsia or magenta, this is easier to do -- you can say it's a dark pink or you can say it's a pinkish red or something like this. But for simple colour terms, how do you define 'red'? That's a more difficult task. So she has a post about the history of coming up with either very eloquent literary definitions or very technical definitions and some of the difficulties that editors at Merriam Webster have come up with in terms of defining colour terms."
5,61,Lauren,There are another group of people who have an effect when it comes to learning language and those people are children.
5,62,Gretchen,"Here's a fun experiment to do if you have a child or you know a child -- it's asking what some colours are! Because kids are actually quite bad at colours, a lot of them are really terrible at them. So this one paper that I was reading said by two years children can generally learn a 'highly imaginable concrete noun' from a single exposure but they're still making colour errors at age six. So colours are not as easy to learn as 'this is a dog'."
5,63,Lauren,Right so you can show them something that they've never seen before and be like 'hey kid this is a blerg'.
5,64,Gretchen,And they'll learn the word 'blerg'.
5,65,Lauren,And then two weeks later you can be like 'go get that blerg for me' and they'll know exactly what that is. But you can say to a child what colour's that very purple looking dress over there and they'll be like 'pink?'.
5,66,Gretchen,"Blue?! Yeah, and they're aware that colour words exist. If you ask them to list how many colour words they know, they can list you some that they then can't identify or can't identify correctly. This other thing that the paper showed was that they compared two populations of children, I think it was one English-speaking or Western group of kids that got a lot of explicit colour instruction with a lot of exclusive colour terms, and the other one with a group of kids that weren't getting this kind of instruction -- I forgot what language they were speaking -- and they made the same number of errors at age six. They were still having problems regardless of whether they've been getting, like, three years of intensive instruction in colours in preschool or whether they were not really getting any colour instruction at all."
5,67,Lauren,"Right, ok, so children are bad at colour."
5,68,Gretchen,Which is weird considering how good children are a lot of other stuff in language.
5,69,Lauren,"Yeah. I did not know that, this is a thing I learnt."
5,70,Gretchen,They're doing complicated verb tenses before they're doing colours.
5,71,Lauren,"Well, the other thing is even adults sometimes disagree about colours. If you ever want to have some fun with adults, get an ambiguously coloured scarf or something, and ask people whether it's fuchsia or whether it's magenta or whether it's maroon. I'm sure I could have had my friend tearing the classroom apart with her grey-brown-purple scarf."
5,72,Gretchen,"Yeah, or whether something's turquoise or teal or if it's turquoise is it more blue or more green."
5,73,Lauren,"We have this problem in my family because I have a dress that used to be my mother's, and my mother constantly refers to 'the red dress' and my sister and I both know it as the 'salmon' or the 'pink' dress it's a very very rich pink, but it is definitely pink. And it really weirds me out because my mom is an art teacher, like I just feel like if someone should be able to know the cutoff between red and really dark pink... and I just wonder are we seeing the world the same way, like where does her red stop? I need to get a set of Munsell chips and test my mother."
5,74,Gretchen,"Yeah you do I mean but maybe she has a different cut off point for for where the colours are, like people disagree about this stuff. And I think that this is one of the things that Kory Stamper noted in the dictionary post is that even when you can pin down a bunch of descriptive terms for colour, some people will disagree about 'is fuchsia redder than magenta or is magenta redder than fuchsia?' something like that."
5,75,Lauren,Yeah or my mum is just wrong is the other obvious possibility.
5,76,Gretchen,"I mean she's your mother that makes her wrong, right?."
5,77,Lauren,"It's a really nice dress, thanks for the dress mum."
5,78,Gretchen,"But I think these are legitimate areas where people can disagree. One area where you can see that English speakers have changed our conceptions of what we think of as belonging to specific colour boundaries is in what we think of as red. So a lot of people wonder, 'Why do we call people redheads?' or 'Why do we call hair red when really this is an orange coloured hair?' and the thing is is that there have been English speakers with orange coloured hair, with this particular coloured hair, for much longer than English has had a word for orange."
5,79,Lauren,Ahhh that's why that is.
5,80,Gretchen,"Yeah, so initially English doesn't have a word for orange. The word for orange gets introduced somewhere in Middle English. When the first oranges start arriving from warmer climates, of course oranges don't grow in England, up until that point there hadn't been a word for the colour. And then when the food gets introduced suddenly there's this very salient thing in a colour that is very specific. The Anglo-Saxons had a few words like 'yellow-red', which was kind of a yellow red colour and 'saffron' but they mostly talked about it as red and the orange is responsible in the introduction of that colour and 'redhead' stuck around as a fossilised term from before we needed a distinction between those colours. And you might wonder, well, why don't we use a different vegetable that is also orange instead of oranges? Surely oranges are kind of far removed from England. But in fact, if you think of other salient orange fruits and vegetables, carrots for example originally came in a bunch of colours so you could get carrots in purple, you could get carrots in yellow, you get carrots in orange, and you can still get these at a farmers market or something but they're a bit more obscure. So carrots are not that useful as a reference term for particular colour because how do you know if you're talking about purple or you're talking about orange? And pumpkins are a New World vegetable, they're from the Americas, and so they were introduced even later than the orange was."
5,81,Lauren,"Because 'orange' has really swept Europe. You look at your European languages and the word for the colour orange is often the same as that fruit and that's because when oranges arrived people were really like this is the thing with this colour that we haven't really lexically pinned down in our languages before. Which really, it always does my head in when I hear this because I just think of oranges such a basic colour."
5,82,Gretchen,"Yeah it seems really basic to us but if you think about what kinds of objects they had around them then, you had kind of yellows and browns that you can make easily with plant dyes but there weren't a lot of very orange objects so might as well just lump them in with red."
5,83,Lauren,"We're not really going to touch on, because you know there's so much to talk about with colour as a thing, we're not even kind of touching on the metaphoric extensions that people have for certain colours or the cultural signifiers that certain colours are used as across the world. But one thing I think it's fun to talk about is the relationship between colour and other senses. So this crops up in a number of things, one thing I want to talk about is a recent study from de Valk and a bunch of the team at the Meaning, Culture and Cognition lab in Radboud University about the relationship between colour and smells. And in this study they looked at Dutch, Thai, and Maniq which is a language spoken by a small hunter-gatherer community in Thailand. So they live in the same kind of similar cultural context to other Thai speakers but they speak a different language and they live as hunter-gatherers. And the difference in how these groups described odours has implications for the colours that they associate with different smells. And the thing I love about this study is that to distribute the odours they literally just put-- So they had smells that were very familiar to Dutch speakers and smells that were very familiar to people from Thailand whether they were Thai or Maniq speakers so they had smells for things like red wine or peanut butter or they had smells for things like coconut, or smells that were familiar to both groups like banana. And they put these objects-- they just literally put like a banana in a spray bottle and then just sprayed the smell under people's noses. It was very lo-fi but very effective."
5,84,Gretchen,Like a spray bottle with with water or just with air?
5,85,Lauren,Just with air and a banana.
5,86,Gretchen,Okay! This is great.
5,87,Lauren,"And so they repeated the experiment with people twice and they did things where they asked people to describe the small and checked with people asking if they knew what the smell was like, what the object was that they were smelling. So there were a few things and what they found was that Dutch speakers usually describe the odour by describing the object so they would say, if we have the banana in the bottle, they'd say 'oh it smells like banana'. Whereas Thai/Maniq speakers would use words that describe the smell quality. They wouldn't say it smells like a banana, they'd say it smells really sweet. And when people described the odour with an object, so if they said 'oh that smells like a banana,' when they had to match the colours to the odours -- so that bit was the final condition, they were asked to match colours to the odours -- they found that people who used the word for an object to describe the smell would be more likely to use a colour consistently. So if they smelt peanut butter and said 'that smells like peanut butter' they'll be more likely to pick the colour brown whereas if they smelt peanut butter and used a term like 'that smelled musty' then they would be less likely to choose a consistent colour."
5,88,Gretchen,"So mustiness doesn't necessarily have a consistent colour association, but we know what colour peanuts are and they're pretty much always the same colour."
5,89,Lauren,"Yeah so their finding suggests that the odour-colour associations that people have are most likely formed through language. It's really neat article and they have a great website kind of summarizing the findings, we'll put that in the show notes."
5,90,Gretchen,"One thing that interests me about colours and words together is the phenomenon called synesthesia where you have these relationships between different senses. And one of the most common types of synesthesia is what's called grapheme-colour synesthesia, where you associate certain graphemes - letters and numbers and other types of symbolic shapes - with particular colours. I have this kind of synesthesia, so it always interests me when you find particular research about this and this is not unfortunately an episode where we're going to talk about all kinds of synesthesia, because that'd be really cool, we should do one of those. But one thing that I find is cool is that there's sometimes a connection where the colours aren't evenly distributed. So my particular set of synesthesia is not as if the rainbow just sat down and there's the alphabet sitting along it. I have, like, more yellow letters then I do purple letters for no particular reason."
5,91,Lauren,So every letter of the alphabet has it consistent colour mapping for you.
5,92,Gretchen,"Yeah, and all the numbers too. And so a lot of early synesthesia research is just focused on establishing that these are consistent, if you bring synesthetes into the lab and you ask them what colour each letter is, and in a year you bring them back and ask them what colour each letter is again, they'll give you the same answer, whereas for non-synesthetes they'll be a lot more variable. And this research I find very boring because I already know that my colours are consistent, that they're there, because of course I'm experiencing them, but this is how you do science I guess. And the later research has been trying to show kind of more complex stuff about it. So this is a specific topic I'd love to see more people research."
5,93,Lauren,Ok we'll do a synesthesia episode at one point then.
5,94,Gretchen,"Well, one way you can get kind of colour/ letter effects even if you're not a synesthete is you can do what's called a Stroop test, and what this is, is that you take a word like green and you write in a colour ink that does not correspond to the actual word. So you write green with, let's say, red ink. And then you tell people, 'Okay, you need to read the colour of the ink not the word.' And people find it really difficult. So you're seeing green in letters but it's in red ink and so you have to say red. And we will link to an example of a Stroop test that you can take yourself and see how challenging it is."
5,95,Lauren,I am rubbish at them.
5,96,Gretchen,Yeah they're really hard because we get so good at words. They've been used in psycholinguistics literature for a bunch of different things.
5,97,Lauren,You can also fail at a Stroop test and tell us how badly you did through the link in the show notes page.
5,98,Gretchen,"Yes! So this has been a lot of colour research. There are more cool studies out there, if you have a favourite colour study or colour research or colour etymology do feel free to let us know!"
5,99,Lauren,"Or colour, if you have a favourite colour."
5,100,Gretchen,Yeah! What's your favourite colour! [Theme music]

6,1,Gretchen,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, the podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics. I'm Gretchen McCulloch."
6,2,Lauren,"and I'm Lauren Gawne. And today we're going to be talking about the International Phonetic Alphabet. But first -- it was International Mother Language Day in February and even though it was a couple of weeks ago now on February the 21st, I think it's still worth saying a belated 'Happy Mother Language Day' to you Gretchen!"
6,3,Gretchen,"Happy Mother Language Day to you! Which we are wishing in our of mother languages of English, which is kind of boring."
6,4,Lauren,Both wishing it our mother languages. Do you have any other heritage languages that you wish to acknowledge?
6,5,Gretchen,"I mean, technically Scottish Gaelic is probably a long time ago a mother language for me, but my ancestors were lowland Scots so it's a really long time ago."
6,6,Lauren,Well happy Scots Gaelic day
6,7,Gretchen,Do you have any other?
6,8,Lauren,My grandmaternal language is Polish and thanks to generally typical Australian attitudes towards non-English speaking in the 1960s that wasn't passed on to any of my mother's generation at all. So yeah it's still a very recent part of our family history. I'm the only grandchild who ever learnt enough Polish to speak with my grandmother in her mother tongue
6,9,Gretchen,Oh that's cool
6,10,Lauren,"Which is cool, I wish I still spoke that much"
6,11,Gretchen,"Well I mean it's cool that you learned it, it's not cool that no one else did"
6,12,Lauren,"It's probably questionable how much Polish I remember today. And yeah, I always like to think of my Nan and my lack of opportunities to learn Polish on February 21st. What have you been up to or what's coming up?"
6,13,Gretchen,"Well, by the time this episode goes out I will have been to South by Southwest, where I will have done a panel with Erin Mckean and Jane Solomon and Ben Zimmer"
6,14,Lauren,How are you not going to like die of fangirling at people?!
6,15,Gretchen,Because I've already met all of them anyway?
6,16,Lauren,Awwww I'm so jelly
6,17,Gretchen,"But they're really cool and I'm really excited to be on a panel with them! We're going to be talking about 'Word curation: Dictionaries, tech, and the future' which will happen by the time you guys get this episode so you can check out the hashtag that I'm sure will have some action on it and we'll link to that in the show notes."
6,18,Lauren,I'm really excited for that panel. I'm looking forward to it hopefully - is it going to be recorded? Am I going to be able to see it as a non South by Southwest attendee?
6,19,Gretchen,"I think there's going to be an audio recording on soundcloud that South by Southwest is going to put up online because they've done that for previous years. So I can't promise that they'll do that again but they seem to like doing it in previous years, I don't know why they wouldn't do it again so we'll link to that if we have it."
6,20,Lauren,"Yay, excellent! [Music]"
6,21,Gretchen,"So there's a problem when you learn to spell English, which is that it's really hard to spell English."
6,22,Lauren,It's really a lifelong learning process as far as I'm concerned
6,23,Gretchen,"It's a lifelong learning process. You know, some languages don't have spelling bees because their spelling systems are so consistent they don't need them - we can only wish! So, the English spelling system is especially ridiculous, it's got silent letters, it's got something around 14 vowels but only five letters to write them in. My favorite demonstration of this is that there's a phrase that has all of the English vowels and the phrase goes - I have to have to say it in a non-rhotic accent because it only works that way - the phrase goes 'Who would know aught of art must learn, act and then take his ease'. And each of those words has a different vowel in it."
6,24,Lauren,Cool!
6,25,Gretchen,And that's one way of remembering the vowels
6,26,Lauren,That's a nifty sentence!
6,27,Gretchen,"Yeah, but if you try to write that down in English it's hard"
6,28,Lauren,"With the English orthography that we have, or the English writing system - orthography - that we have"
6,29,Gretchen,"And spelling systems are also inconsistent across different languages. Even languages that are consistent in themselves are often inconsistent when you compare them with each other. So, some languages use the letter J for the /dʒ/ sound [as in Jane], some languages use it for the /ʒ/ sound like French [Jean], some languages use it for the 'y' /j/ sound like German as in 'Jan' or 'Johann Sebastian Bach', some languages use it for the /x/ sound as in Spanish like 'Juan'. There's a whole bunch of different sounds you can use the same letter for depending on your language"
6,30,Lauren,"There's a really great tumblr post that kind of encapsulates this variety in the ways different alphabets that are based on the same alphabet English is based on, use their orthographies in different ways which we'll link to. When I first read this I was like oh look someone's just posting in Norwegian or Danish or something, but then if you sit there and read it and you know the orthographic conventions in different languages it says something along the lines of 'I wonder if English speakers will notice that I'm writing this in English but using the spelling conventions of my language'"
6,31,Gretchen,"And yeah a whole bunch of people have certain different versions of it - there's a Finnish one which is pretty good, there's an Irish one which is fantastic"
6,32,Lauren,"It's good, because once you know what the phrase is that gives you a feel for what the conventions are in different languages. For example I found the Polish one really easy to read and then for some of the others I was just basically guessing because I knew what the sentence was, and it really nicely illustrates this problem that we have that we all learn different spelling conventions for different languages"
6,33,Gretchen,"And we're not the first people to have noticed this problem! In fact people have been realizing this problem for quite a long time, as long as people have been writing with different systems. And it became especially apparent as writing systems became standardised in the 1700s and 1800s, when dictionaries are becoming popular and people were starting to write in a standardised sort of way and looking at other languages and realising that their standardisations were converging on something different"
6,34,Lauren,"I really love that historically there was no consistent spelling conventions, and so in Old English text we actually have a good idea of the different common literate dialects of people who lived in Mercia or people who live in Cumbria and because the way that they wrote English really reflected the way their accent worked. Once spelling systems became standardized that stopped being the case"
6,35,Gretchen,"It also became really difficult people for who are trying to learn English because even if you learn the spelling systems, then you pronounce the words the way they look and people look at you like 'that's not actually how it's pronounced' and you're like 'how was I supposed to remember that?' Various people came up with various proposals for spelling reform for either just like a more phonetic way of writing English in total, or for ways of adapting English words so that it could be used for specialised purposes like people who are learning the language, or people who want to write down specific things and annotate exactly how they're said"
6,36,Lauren,"And some people went for massive 'let's create an entirely new alphabet', some people just wanted some small reforms. So Noah Webster is probably one of the people who had the most impressive effect on English especially on American English. It was Webster who decided to take and consistently use conventions like 'i-z-e' instead of 'i-s-e' and using words like colour without the 'u' instead of with the 'u' as part of this attempt to make English spelling more realistically reflect the language that was being spoken"
6,37,Gretchen,"Yeah and there were other British reformers that were trying to do this, so there was a guy named Henry Sweet who came up with an alphabet called the Romic /ɹomɪk/ alphabet or the Romic /ɹɑmɪk/ alphabet, I'm not actually sure how to pronounce the name of this alphabet, which..."
6,38,Lauren,If only was written down some where in a consistently pronounceable script!
6,39,Gretchen,If only! He didn't seem to actually write the name of his own alphabet anywhere in a consistent script so that's a shame. And that was based on mostly Roman letters but with adaptations for sounds that English had and Latin hadn't. And then there was Alexander Ellis who was apparently the real-life origin of Henry Higgins from 'My Fair Lady'
6,40,Lauren,Really?!
6,41,Gretchen,"I dunno, that's what Wikipedia says!"
6,42,Lauren,"Okay, because I'm going to invoke the supremacy of David Crystal, if that's okay. I don't know if Crystal officially trumps Wikipedia, but in his book called 'Wordsmiths and Warriors' he says if Higgins is anyone it has to be Daniel Jones who is a phonetician who is very influential in terms of like codifying the vowel system. So what we think of is the modern International Phonetic Alphabet vowel space kind of started with Daniel Jones' cardinal vowels"
6,43,Gretchen,I mean I don't know it could have been a composite or something
6,44,Lauren,"I think to be honest that the most likely is that there was a genre of gentleman academic at the time who's very interested in these topics. Anyway, there was a lot of work being invested in generating some kind of writing system that accurately reflected speech"
6,45,Gretchen,"Yeah and so they made the International Phonetic Association in the late 1800s, which confusingly enough also has the acronym IPA, and they had some meetings and they were like, 'yeah, we need to come up with a system for this'"
6,46,Lauren,So the IPA is where the IPA was created
6,47,Gretchen,Yeah I hope they were all drinking IPA but I can't guarantee that
6,48,Lauren,In our reenactment that is definitely what's happening
6,49,Gretchen,"Yeah, when we when we all get dressed up in historic costume (bagsies Henry Sweet), then we will all drink IPA"
6,50,Lauren,"I'm Daniel Jones apparently - no wait, I'm going to dress up as Cardinal Vowel, I always thought that would be a great linguist costume"
6,51,Gretchen,Ah that's great! Were cardinal vowels invented yet?
6,52,Lauren,"Well it was Daniel Jones who did that, I don't know when he was working"
6,53,Gretchen,Oh ok good
6,54,Lauren,"I mean we'll have to have a whole episode just talking about vowels and how they work, but that was kind of a thing that was figured out at the time"
6,55,Gretchen,Yeah and they came up with some principles for future development of this International Phonetic Alphabet and these were: each symbol should have its own distinctive sound and the same symbol should be used for the same sound across all languages
6,56,Lauren,"So instead of having the J sound sounding like /dʒ/ or /ʒ/ or /j/ or /x/ across different languages, every time that sound was used it would be used for exactly the same sound"
6,57,Gretchen,Every time that *symbol* was used
6,58,Lauren,Yes sorry every time that symbol was used it would be used for the same sound
6,59,Gretchen,"They also came up with some principles that influenced which symbols ended up being chosen for which sounds. So they decided to use as many ordinary Roman letters as possible and to have a very minimal number of new letters, and to use what they called quote unquote 'international' usage to decide the sound for each symbol"
6,60,Lauren,"So they wouldn't like, take the symbol that we have for 's' and decide 'oh we're going to make that the sound for 'l' because we're crazy people'"
6,61,Gretchen,"Yeah, they didn't do that. But the other thing is, so if we look at the vowels, the IPA vowels look kind of weird from an English perspective. So the IPA uses the letter that we think of as 'i' to represent the 'ee' /i/ sound and uses the letter we think of as 'e' to represent the 'eh' /e/ sound and so on. And this doesn't make sense for English, but it does make sense when you look at a whole bunch of other languages like Spanish and Italian, and the way the Roman alphabet has been used for non-European languages generally falls along these principles as well. So they said, 'Look, even though we're English speakers we're going to not do the English things'"
6,62,Lauren,"Okay, so they really did go with this kind of international general preference"
6,63,Gretchen,"Yeah, I mean, they're still eurocentric, they're still starting with European languages and kind of working their way outwards, but they were at least not completely Anglo-centric, which is helpful here, because English does some weird stuff with its sounds"
6,64,Lauren,"Yeah and we only have 26 letters in the English alphabet, a few more if we kind of pull everything from across European languages, and there are so many more sounds that the world's languages can make, so once we've run out of kind of standard letters where do we go from there?"
6,65,Gretchen,"Where we are from there is often Greek letters or Latinised looking versions of Greek letters because those were familiar to these creators. Another thing that they did was they would rotate letters. and this was partly because the shapes are still familiar if you do that and partly because this is the 1800s and people were typing with metal bits of type. So if you just take a lowercase 'e' and turn it upside down, you can just print your new character by flipping or rotating an existing metal type bit rather than casting a new one"
6,66,Lauren,"I have a really nice example from Australia, so I was at a workshop the other day and a colleague was showing me a booklet of Kamilaroi, so it's a language from the New England area of New South Wales in Australia, and William Ridley was working on this language in 1856. So this is even before the IPA was codified. And these languages have a sound like an English sound but you may not notice it in English because it's a sound at the end of words like 'sing' or 'bring', that /ŋ/ sound, but that sound can occur anywhere so you can have it at the start of the word as well as at the end. This /ŋ/ sound now has a symbol in the IPA that looks like an 'n' with a little tail and it's called an 'engma'"
6,67,Gretchen,Yeah kind of like an 'n' with a 'g' tail shoved on it
6,68,Lauren,"Yeah, and Ridley is one of the first people who adopted this symbol for use in his describing languages work in the 1850s, which was before the 1880s when the IPA was established. But this symbol had begun to be used for this /ŋ/ and it makes sense because it's like an 'n' and a 'g' squashed together. But when he sent it to the typesetters for his booklet they didn't have a /ŋ/ and so they just turned a capital 'G' upside down which sounds a bit crazy and it looks a bit crazy it looks like it's just full of upside down 'G's, but it meant that that was a way that they could represent this /ŋ/ sound. Apparently he sent it to some other journal in Europe and they just turned it all into a 'z'"
6,69,Gretchen,"Wow, a 'z'!"
6,70,Lauren,Yeeeah
6,71,Gretchen,"Wow, that's really bad! So I guess that's why it's good that another principle the IPA had was that the look of the new letters should suggest the sound they represent, so once you've learned the kind of basic ones and if you see a couple languages and you have a sense of what's used in other languages then you can often guess fairly accurately what an IPA letter is going to be like. So it's better to have a symbol for /ŋ/'that looks like an 'n' and a 'g' shoved together because that's how it's often written in different languages, a bit like an 'n' sound, a bit like a 'g' sound. Another one of their principles was that diacritics should be avoided where possible. So adding extra little like accent marks or other types of small bits on top of letters was something that they tried to avoid for their basic sounds. Diacritics were only was supposed to be for if there's a modified version of a sound, but not for basic sounds in general. So in the current IPA, you still get these rotated letters, which must make the IPA very difficult for people who are dyslexic; you get small capitals; you get Greek stuff like the Greek letter theta is used for the 'th' /θ/ sound, and the runic and ultimately Icelandic sound /ð/ -- so the symbol that looks like an 'o' with kind of a cross above it, that's from Icelandic and it used to be in English before the Normans came, that got borrowed back in -- so borrowing from other established systems. Because then you could just go to Iceland and grab some of their metal type bits, I don't know, or go to Greece and get some from them"
6,72,Lauren,"It's something that was a problem with the original metal type but it's also been a problem for a long time with modern software. So for a long time computers didn't really have fonts that expanded beyond the kind of really basic font set of like English and French and some diacritics and some special things. If you have some older software or if you look at older digital documents you have, y'know, people using capital 'A' for particular vowel sounds, vowel characters in the IPA that are symbols in the IPA that aren't in regular type or y'know schwa would be a capital 'E' for example"
6,73,Gretchen,"Yeah you can even see this on some old websites, people will use a different system that only uses the basic 26, plus capitals to do the extra stuff or maybe some places use like an 'at' sign @ to indicate a schwa, because we've also had a different version of this encoding problem with technology"
6,74,Lauren,So it's not just the metal type it's also modern computing
6,75,Gretchen,It's also the byte! It's the type and the byte!
6,76,Lauren,"The type and the byte have been a problem, it's getting better"
6,77,Gretchen,"It's getting better thanks to Unicode, thanks Unicode! So yeah the first version from 1887 was designed to work for sounds in English, French, and German because that's what they were doing at the time. It's a bit weird compared to the modern IPA because we're used to seeing it as a chart and they just gave a list of symbols and keywords that stuff was found in for various languages. So they'd say something like okay this 'a' symbol is going to be like the sound in English 'father' or this symbol is going to be like the sound in German 'Bach' and they just give the keywords like sometimes you see in the front of the dictionary. And then later, so they kept on working on it in the late 1800s and then by the year they expanded, published a version that included Arabic and a few other languages' sounds, that's when they finally publish it as a table for the first time"
6,78,Lauren,"So why would it be in it table, for people who aren't familiar with the International Phonetic Alphabet?"
6,79,Gretchen,"The cool thing about the table is -- so our English alphabet that you learn as a kid is 'ABCD' in no particular order, that's just the order it is, that's just for historical reasons -- but the table is ordered based on how the sounds are produced. So sounds get produced with constriction in various parts of the mouth and with different degrees of constriction once you're in that place"
6,80,Lauren,So it's a nice feature based table of all the kind of combination of features in particular places
6,81,Gretchen,"Yeah, exactly. If you superimpose a mouth onto that table, it looks a bit weird but you can kind of do it and you can see where each of the sounds is produced"
6,82,Lauren,"I have a link somewhere to an audible IPA chart so you can click on the sounds and hear what they sound like, but the ones on the very left side are all produced with just the lips like /p/, and the very front of the mouth. And then the ones at the very right edge are all the way back at the far back of the mouth, and that's things like your velar sounds like /g/ get made with that soft bit there or your uvula like right down in the very far back in the mouth"
6,83,Gretchen,"Yeah, it goes from your lips, through your mouth along the roof of your mouth and back into your throat. And the weird thing about this version from 1900 is that it's a mirror image of that so it has 'p' and 'b', your labial sounds on the right instead of on the left"
6,84,Lauren,"Oh no, that would confuse me so much"
6,85,Gretchen,"You can see an image of it on Wikipedia, it's all like typewritten, we'll link to that"
6,86,Lauren,"Wow, awesome"
6,87,Gretchen,"But it looks really weird, and they also have the vowel chart and the consonant chart on the same chart"
6,88,Lauren,"Right, okay!"
6,89,Gretchen,They just have like a really wide section where the vowels go
6,90,Lauren,How weird!
6,91,Gretchen,"Yeah, which is something else that changed later"
6,92,Lauren,"So there's now a table for the consonants, there's a few consonants that don't even fit, and then there's a vowel chart that's a separate thing, but it's very similar principle like it starts at the front of the mouth and goes back"
6,93,Gretchen,"Yeah, and what's cool is that the version that we use today is actually very very similar to the version that was solidified in 1932, which was quite a while ago. There were some adjustments made in 1989 and then after that it's just like 'oh well we need to add this one symbol because we found some languages that use it' but pretty much it stays very similar for quite a long time once it's established"
6,94,Lauren,"Nice. So it goes from left to right all the different places in the mouth, and then from top to bottom there are different ways just looking at the consonants, the ways to pronounce different consonants so you have the very plosive sounds like /b/, /k/, /d/, /t/ - we call them stops - along one row and your nasal sounds, so your /m/, /n/, /ŋ/, sounds along another row..."
6,95,Gretchen,"It kind of goes in order of how much you need to drop your jaw. So if you think about the sounds in the top row, your mouth is the most closed when you're making like a 'p' or a 'b'. You have to literally close your mouth for a second, you have to close your lips to make those sounds. Whereas if you're making a sound like 'r' /ɹ/ you don't have to actually close anything you're letting the sounds kinda come through. So the 'r' /ɹ/ sounds are near the bottom, but the /p, b/ sounds are near the top"
6,96,Lauren,I mean that's the thing I found super neat about it when I was studying the IPA in undergrad was just how elegantly it captures all these different parameters in one table
6,97,Gretchen,"Yeah, just to realize that someone has thought this through, thinking 'ok what are all the permutations you could put your mouth in and which ones do people actually use and let's organize this'"
6,98,Lauren,And English just uses one subset of it
6,99,Gretchen,"Yeah, every language is going to pick some subset of the sounds in this table, or if it doesn't we have to add something. So one of the cool things that you can do with the IPA because it's based on different positions the mouth can be in is adapt it to other mouth stuff. For example, Lauren Ackerman, who has the linguistics blog 'Wug Life', has made a table of emoji with their mouth positions as if they're making sounds in the IPA. So you can look at this table and she has things like the surprised emoji, which has kind of a round mouth and so that's like an 'oo' /u/ sound because you have to round your lips for that, and the 'ee' /i/ is kind of like a smile, and it is completely ludicrous but also great"
6,100,Lauren,These are the important things that linguists do with their downtime
6,101,Gretchen,"Yeah and the other cool thing you can do with the IPA is because you can use it to represent mouth sounds is you can write beatboxing in IPA, because beatboxing is done with the mouth"
6,102,Lauren,"Oh yeah, that must look amazing!"
6,103,Gretchen,"It looks so cool! I have a picture of it, of a chart that some beatboxing linguist researchers made"
6,104,Lauren,That is awesome
6,105,Gretchen,So we'll link to that too
6,106,Gretchen,"I mean we both have a lot of love for the International Phonetic Alphabet, obviously it's something we engage with a lot in all varieties of linguistic work. I think it's worth mentioning though that like, it's not perfect for everything, it can get really annoying sometimes."
6,107,Gretchen,Yes!
6,108,Lauren,"Particularly, as I mentioned in terms of the fact that font encoding on computers is still a problem, you still occasionally will get proofs back from a publisher for a journal article and all the engma, they're all mysteriously like really ugly still, we haven't quite got there with them being part of the font set for every single font"
6,109,Gretchen,Yeah and it can be hard to write on a normal keyboard
6,110,Lauren,"Yeah it's also really annoying to write on a normal keyboard sometimes. Also especially in the vowels, like I get a bit of like IPA anxiety when I use IPA and share it with people publicly, especially for long passages of text it's not always that easy to transcribe things"
6,111,Gretchen,"Yeah, and as fluent writers we've gotten used to the Byzantine nature of the English spelling system and we we also know how to talk, but thinking about how you talk in a more conscious way to say 'what sound am I saying here, what sound am I saying there' -- that's different. So it can be hard to write extended passages in IPA. I know if I make a blog post that has an English sentence or two in IPA, I'll inevitably get some corrections from a linguist or something that says 'I think you're probably producing this sound here' and I'm like 'Oh yeah you're right' because there's no spellcheck for IPA"
6,112,Lauren,"Yeah and also even if there were a spellcheck, you and I would produce different IPA transcriptions for our own pronunciation of things"
6,113,Gretchen,"Yeah and we're pretty good with understanding people's different pronunciations of things when we're hearing them, because I guess humans have a lot of evolutionary practice at that, but for reading things we have a fairly standardised system. I remember when I was still a young linguist back when John Wells's phonetic blog was active. He's a well-known British linguist who's involved in some of the history of the IPA and he used to keep a blog and he would sometimes write full posts in IPA. And they were really interesting for me to read, to practice but I also found them very difficult because he would be transcribing his own accent. And he was British and so he wouldn't write all these 'r' /ɹ/ after vowels that I would, so I had to figure out where all these /ɹ/ were supposed to be. I'd end up reading his post out loud to myself and hearing the British accent being like 'oh yeah this is what he's trying to say'"
6,114,Lauren,You would be saying it in his accent?
6,115,Gretchen,"Yeah, I'd be saying it in his accent, because you can write someone's accent, which is the cool thing but also the more challenging thing about reading IPA"
6,116,Lauren,"Linguists also talk about broad IPA and narrow IPA transcription - so like, you can do a kind of rough-and-ready, mostly correct transcription, or actually if you are a phonetician and you're looking really closely at how people actually articulate things, you discover all kinds of things that you need to transcribe to capture the correct and accurate transcription but which people don't hear kind of consciously or would find really weird when you've represented it to them"
6,117,Gretchen,Yeah or don't notice
6,118,Lauren,"And there's often like phonological processes, like when you tell people that the vowel that they use in the middle of 'handbag' is actually, for native speakers if they say it quickly, it often becomes 'hambag'"
6,119,Gretchen,"'hambag', like a ham sandwich"
6,120,Lauren,"Yeah, like a bag-o-ham. If you write it out in IPA, people are like 'that's incorrect,' and you're like 'well that's what you said'"
6,121,Gretchen,"There's a fun story about that, so English speakers also often say 'sammich' instead of 'sandwich' because the 'm' the like the nasal sound becomes like the 'w'. Except for Anglo-Italians; so in Canada there's like Italian Torontonians and Italian Montrealers and people who grew up in those communities often have a particular accent. So in that accent they say 'sangwich' instead of sammich' because in Italian the 'w' sound is kind of more velar whereas in English it's more labial and so it like pulls the nasal along with it to be a different sound"
6,122,Lauren,"And when you start transcribing things in really close IPA you can see those distinctions, it's really cool"
6,123,Gretchen,Yeah and we often just reduce the vowels in words that we're saying quickly or in the small unimportant function words we often reduce the vowels all to schwa or something like that
6,124,Lauren,"I still remember in in my undergraduate class learning that English vowels will often change into schwa, this is the /ə/ sound in unstressed syllables and it just made me realize that for a certain set of words, that's why I was really bad at spelling them. Because you sit there and you're like 'is it amu... amuni ammunition?'. I mean, is it ammunitiON or is it ammunitiAN? That's not a great word to use as an example but it's the first one that came to mind. For certain vowels, because it's unstressed and it's a schwa, it's possible that any of the vowel letters could be used to spell it. So you just have to memorize what the spelling is because your pronunciation doesn't help you. And that's why I tell people I'm bad at English spelling - it's not my fault, it's the fault of my stress system and orthography!"
6,125,Gretchen,"The other thing is, is sometimes English orthography gives you useful cues to distinguish between certain words or when a suffix who's added sometimes the stress changes and you have to recover vowels that are kind of there but had turned into schwa. So if you take a word like 'electric' which becomes 'electricity' - in some senses it's weird that it's spelled with a 'c' and not with a 'k' or an 's' because 'c' is completely redundant, it always makes one of those two sounds, but it does reflect that when it's 'electric' with the 'k' sound and then when you add an '-ity' to it, the 'k' sound becomes an 's' sound because that's what happens with 'c', but it doesn't happen with 'k'. Or the vowels also change - with 'electric', 'electricity' you get different sorts of vowels. So it's kind of useful to have some of this stuff there that was historically there and has changed in its sound. But it also creates this extra layer of complication. Or you can get used to speed reading because a word always looks like the same in spelling whereas if you had to speed read a whole bunch of different accents then an unfamiliar accent might be harder to speed read, but then again it's harder to learn spelling in the first place if you have an accent that's less similar to the spelling system"
6,126,Lauren,But we still love the IPA for all of the occasional detriments that occur
6,127,Gretchen,"We still love it and it's still useful to have it as an option to write something very specifically even if you don't want to do that all the tim. I find if I'm meeting somebody and they have a name I haven't heard before, then I write it in IPA and then I can pronounce it correctly when I'm talking back to them. People like it when you pronounce their names correctly."
6,128,Lauren,"That's handy. The Journal of the International Phonetic Association used to accept articles written in IPA, which blows my mind. So people would write about some feature of phonetics and they would do the whole thing in the IPA. I think it very quickly became apparent that that was more labour both to produce and to consume than there was any benefit in doing that, for many of the reasons that we've already mentioned"
6,129,Gretchen,"Like, 'hi I'm going to write about like long vowels in Sussex' or something and that whole thing would be in IPA"
6,130,Lauren,"Yes, I think academics clearly had more time on their hands 50 years ago."
6,131,Gretchen,"I mean, to be fair, I have played IPA Scrabble, which is like Scrabble, but you do it in IPA"
6,132,Lauren,Do you just kind of argue for your own pronunciation or do you have to do it in your own dialect?
6,133,Gretchen,"The way that I've done it is I combined IPA Scrabble with Descriptivist Scrabble, which is a little bit like those bluffing games, so as long as you can convince other people that it's a word then it's a word"
6,134,Lauren,"Ah, I like that"
6,135,Gretchen,"Yeah, because like, dictionaries are arbitrary authorities anyway, so with Descriptivist Scrabble you can just use whatever means you have at your disposal to convince people that it's a word. Of course choosing an obvious word like dog or something is going to be easier to convince people than saying--"
6,136,Lauren,blergh?
6,137,Gretchen,"Yeah, than saying 'blerg is a word, honestly it means a colour kind of like grey and blue at the same time' but you can try!"
6,138,Lauren,There are heaps of cool things people have done with the IPA including someone has made a set of IPA Scrabble
6,139,Gretchen,"Yeah so I posted on All Things Linguistic a set of frequencies and scores that you can use for IPA Scrabble tiles, because I made it with a friend in undergrad and we had figured this out. We just cut out bits of cardboard to make them, and then some undergrads at Yale came across this post and decided to get their friend who has like a wood cutting machine to cut these out of these gorgeous wood tiles and they sent me some photos which I've also posted. You can see those on the blog, they're amazing, so yeah so someone has made a wooden IPA set that I still have not played but it's really cool"
6,140,Lauren,"IPA characters also make for popular tattoos because they're quite beautiful, so I've definitely seen a schwa tattoo and I've seen a glottal stop which is a little bit like a question mark - it's our logo!"
6,141,Gretchen,It is also our logo. Do people get whole words in IPA or like phrases in IPA tattooed on them?
6,142,Lauren,Mmm I haven't seen any but if anyone has we will definitely be interested in seeing it
6,143,Gretchen,If you know any IPA tattoos please send them to us
6,144,Lauren,Well I've seen a couple but not that long
6,145,Gretchen,There's also a whole version of Alice in Wonderland that's published in IPA - so this takes us back to the Journal of Phonetics - and she's like talking to the Mad Hatter and so on and it's all in IPA. The weird thing about this particular version is that this publisher decided to also have capital letters
6,146,Lauren,"Huh, interesting"
6,147,Gretchen,And of course they had to make capital versions for all of the IPA letters
6,148,Lauren,"Wow, that's commitment"
6,149,Gretchen,"Because you know if you think about it capitals are redundant, they don't add any extra phonetic information to a sound, so the IPA doesn't use them. And sometimes the IPA uses small cap versions of a letter to indicate a different sound because it's an extra symbol. And so instead this person decided that no, if I'm going to write it as a book I'm going to make capitals and so yeah it's very interesting how they decided them."
6,150,Lauren,"Yeah, there you go. My IPA nerd craft activity was to cross stitch the consonant chart, I did that quite a few years ago and it's a very useful adornment in the office when you just need to quickly refer to some of the symbols. I also was going to do the vowel chart but the modern vowel chart is very very complicated and messy which is why I went with Jones's much more elegant original cardinal vowels"
6,151,Gretchen,Ahh so you did a simplified version
6,152,Lauren,Yep I'll put links to those in the show notes
6,153,Gretchen,"And you also did a cookie cutter, right?"
6,154,Lauren,"Oh yeah! I made a schwa cookie cutter for Christmas last year, just what you need, and it's a 3D printable cookie cutter, so you can also download that design and print your own and make your own gingerbread schwa or shortbread schwas."
6,155,Gretchen,"That's great. There's also an IPA version of the game 2048, which came out when the game 2048 was popular - so that's the one where you like slide the tiles around and you try to combine to make bigger and bigger things. And so you start with a schwa and then you combine them to make an engma, which makes no sense phonetically, and then you combine them to make an esh. Again, this won't teach you anything about phonetics"
6,156,Lauren,But it goes into more and more elaborate and less frequent forms
6,157,Gretchen,"Yeah it does get to more and more elaborate stuff, like you end up with like a glottalised bilabial click or something like that"
6,158,Lauren,"Right, it doesn't officially teach you anything about the IPA but it is a good excuse for a distraction"
6,159,Gretchen,"You should not do it if you're a student and you're about to write an exam on the IPA, this is not a good way to procrastinate"
6,160,Lauren,Official warning!
6,161,Gretchen,Instead you should play IPA scrabble
6,162,Lauren,Much better way!
6,163,Gretchen,Which will teach you some more about the IPA
6,164,Lauren,Or read Alice in Wonderland
6,165,Gretchen,"There's also a fun sketch from the sketch comedy show John Finnemore's Souvenir Programme, which is a sketch where some characters encounter some skeletons and the skeletons are pirates but these skeletons cannot tell you that there are pirates because they don't have any lips, so they cannot produce the 'p', sound so they call themselves 'kirates',"
6,166,Lauren,Awww
6,167,Gretchen,"And the characters who encounter them are very confused, like 'what are you?' 'we're kirates, I said we're kirates!'. Anyway, I am probably not doing it justice but you should listen to it, we have a link to that as well"
6,168,Lauren,Excellent
6,169,Gretchen,"Although they don't make the point which I kept thinking, which was like 'Well, if the don't have any lips, they probably don't have any tongues either, so they probably can't produce any sounds because they're skeletons'"
6,170,Lauren,They probably don't have any kind of pulmonic air flow ability
6,171,Gretchen,Like all they can do is clack
6,172,Lauren,"Yup, Morse code?"
6,173,Gretchen,"Yeah! So skeletons can communicate with us in Morse code, there we go"
6,174,Lauren,Yeah. I was going to say sign language just because I always seem to want to mention sign languages because they're always cool
6,175,Gretchen,Oh yeah please do
6,176,Lauren,"it's worth pointing out that like obviously the IPA is for all spoken languages, if you haven't figured that out by this point in the podcast, I'll just make that abundantly clear. It's for all oral languages. In individual sign languages people talk about like phonemes and morphemes in terms of hand shapes so there are some hand shapes that are possible in some sign languages that don't occur in others. And so you have a similar kind of basic feature sets that you can refer to in in sign languages. But because it uses a more complex modal articulation system and it isn't just limited to the mouth, then it's a bit more complicated cross-sign-linguistically, but they do have their own kind of equivalent of phonemes or phonetics"
6,177,Gretchen,"There's a couple different standardised sign transcription systems, I don't know if any of them have caught on at an international level in the same way to the IPA has, I mean to be fair there there are other phonetic transcription systems that aren't the IPA, it's just the IPA has caught on more than the others. But you can transcribe signs, there's a couple different ways of doing that. There's also the fact that sign languages have alphabets that they use to borrow words in from spoken languages among other functions and within that there are sign equivalents of at least some IPA characters, which I know because I've been to linguistics conferences and seen interpreters signing talks and they will sign a particular IPA symbol when the person who's giving the presentation is talking about that particular IPA symbol"
6,178,Lauren,There you go
6,179,Gretchen,"Yeah, I cannot recite any of them for you, but I remember noticing it and thinking 'huh, ok I guess that's what they're doing'"
6,180,Lauren,"Man, awesome! [Music]"
6,181,Lauren,"For more Lingthusiasm and links to all the things mentioned in this episode go to Lingthusiasm dot com. You can listen to us on iTunes, Google Play Music, SoundCloud or wherever else you get your podcasts. You can follow at @Lingthusiasm on Twitter, Facebook and Tumblr. I tweet and blog as Superlinguo"
6,182,Gretchen,"And I can be found as @GretchenAMcC on Twitter and my blog is All Things Linguistic dot com. Lingthusiasm is created and produced by Gretchen McCulloch and Lauren Gawne, our producer is Claire and our music by The Triangles. Stay Lingthusiastic! [Music]"
7,1,Lauren,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics. I'm Lauren Gawne."
7,2,Gretchen,and I'm Gretchen McCulloch. Today we're going to be talking about kids these days and how they're not ruining language. But first we have an exciting announcement. Lingthusiasm is on Patreon! Yay!
7,3,Lauren,"Yay! So if you want more Lingthusiasm every month, or an opportunity to ask us your burning linguistics questions, or you just want to help us keep the show running sustainably, doing things like paying our producer and our web hosting fees, and the person who writes our transcripts, then you can help support us on the Patreon and that directly allows us to keep the show running in a sustainable manner."
7,4,Gretchen,"Yeah, and if you're wondering if we can upgrade our mics, or have guest linguists to interview, or maybe even a live show..."
7,5,Lauren,Live show! Yes! We want this to happen too!
7,6,Gretchen,"We really want this to happen, we want to hang out with you guys. The answer is 'yes' we would like to do all these things but we can't do it alone."
7,7,Lauren,"The cool thing about Patreon is that it allows us to keep this space advertising free for everybody. So the main episode every month will always run without advertising, so every time you don't hear an ad trying to sell you a web building tool or something to eat or something to read."
7,8,Gretchen,"I think we should really take ads for like sketchy 'teach yourself a language in three days' courses, I think those would be really reputable to associate ourselves with."
7,9,Lauren,Definitely - we don't have to do that though because we've set up the Patreon and we think it's a much better way for us to keep doing the show and for you to keep enjoying the show.
7,10,Gretchen,And if you want to listen to our bonus episodes our first one is about swearing. So we decided not to swear in the main podcast because we want people to be able to put it on at work or around kids so instead we're really letting loose in the Patreon episode! So if you pledge you can listen to that right now.
7,11,Lauren,You can listen to us talking about our swear acquisition histories and words that sound like swear words in other languages.
7,12,Gretchen,Among other things. We had so much fun recording that episode that I put it on to check that the levels were okay and end up listening to the whole thing even though half of it was my voice.
7,13,Lauren,Were you like 'that's a really good point Gretchen!'?
7,14,Gretchen,Yeah I was like 'you make such good arguments!' 'me too!' 'I feel so connected!'
7,15,Lauren,"Our second bonus episode is going to be about how to self study linguistics, which has been chosen by our Patreon supporters, and we are really excited to have that up later in the month."
7,16,Gretchen,"Because we already have Patreon supporters! We only mentioned the Patreon on social media and there's already been a bunch of people who have pledged us. So thank you for that if you're already one of those people, and if you're just hearing about it now, it's a thing! Maybe you'd like to do that."
7,17,Lauren,"It's at patreon.com/lingthusiasm or you can follow the links from Lingthusiasm or basically anywhere else, we've tweeted and facebooked about it a lot."
7,18,Gretchen,"Really obnoxiously! And also if you can't pledge, we have totally been there, we know what that's like, and we are keeping the main episodes free. It's also super helpful if you can rate us on iTunes and recommend the show in general -- we've been doubling in listeners every month so that's really cool."
7,19,Lauren,"It really is mind-blowing and it's so great that other people are enjoying the show we're so pleased that you are on board with us. Thank you for listening, thank you for getting your friends to listen. Thank you for rating us on iTunes - it's apparently a thing you have to do as a podcasts is be really into getting people rating you on iTunes, but we're just really glad that you're listening."
7,20,Gretchen,"Actually, I want to correct the doubling in listener part -- we actually increased infinitely the first month because we started with zero listeners."
7,21,Lauren,"Good sciencing Gretchen, good sciencing."
7,22,Gretchen,Just so no one writes in to correct my math![Theme music]
7,23,Lauren,"We've already got to the punch line of today's episode but we want to make sure that you leave knowing full well that kids are not ruining language. It's okay everyone, the kids are okay."
7,24,Gretchen,"The kids are okay, the English language is okay, the other languages are more or less okay, but if they aren't it's not the fault of the kids. One of the ways to put complaining about kids language these days into some context is to look historically at the types of things that people used to complain about kids doing, and whether those came to pass and if so whether everything was ruined. Spoiler: the answer is no!"
7,25,Lauren,"Because complaining about the youth goes back a long way. Like, it goes past the current generation of people who are complaining about the youth and goes back basically to the beginning of written records in Western history."
7,26,Gretchen,"I imagine that people were complaining with youth before written history, we just don't know about it."
7,27,Lauren,"One of the most early objectors that we have record of complaining about what the youth are up to these days is Socrates, who complained that all of this newfangled technology called writing was making people forgetful and lazy in terms of learning things, because they no longer had to commit them to memory they could just read them."
7,28,Gretchen,"Those kids, they don't recite Homer like they used to."
7,29,Lauren,"It kind of reminds me of the anxiety around modern technology, when parents are really concerned that children aren't learning to read properly because they're reading on screens instead of paper."
7,30,Gretchen,Now that we have the Google who even remembers anything.
7,31,Lauren,"Mmm exactly, we always blame the technology."
7,32,Gretchen,But yeah Socrates was saying the same thing about writing at all.
7,33,Lauren,"Which I kind of liked because all of these people who worry about the youth of today that they're not respecting writing the way they used to, it's like well, back in the day no one even respected writing, so you're not being pedantic *enough* really."
7,34,Gretchen,"And even post-Socrates, there's a long period of not very many people being literate."
7,35,Lauren,"Yeah, exactly."
7,36,Gretchen,"This idea that everybody writes is quite new and really specific to a minority of the world's languages today - they are the minority that have the most speakers, but many of the world's 7,000 languages get along quite well as purely oral and verbal without any written kind of standard."
7,37,Gretchen,"I think that when we think of languages that are oral languages we also don't think so much about how English also made a transition from being a purely oral language to being both written and oral. That's something that happened in the Middle Ages gradually with fits and starts and there's not as much preserved from the English oral tradition as there might be, I mean there's Beowulf, but there's stuff we've lost there too."
7,38,Lauren,It would just be so great to have an audio video documentary of Old English. Someone needs to invent time travel.
7,39,Gretchen,"This is what I would do if I had time travel. I would go back to all of these different places and times and like document their languages, obviously."
7,40,Lauren,That is the first thing we'd do.
7,41,Gretchen,"I mean, if you can go way back, you could see if you could find the hypothetical Proto-World, like the ancestor of all of the human languages. Was there just one? Were there several original languages? Can we go back and find this? When was it?"
7,42,Lauren,Time travel is really the only way that this is ever going to get solved.
7,43,Gretchen,"Yeah, that's definitely my highest priority, and then you could go back and find like specific proto-languages like proto-Indo-European."
7,44,Lauren,I love that this is top of your to-do list.
7,45,Gretchen,I have thought this through! I have thought of this before.
7,46,Lauren,"I love the like first grant request after they've invented time travel is you being like 'gonna take my audio recorder, let's go!'"
7,47,Gretchen,Yeah!
7,48,Lauren,"So we can't go back that far to see what people were complaining about the kids doing but we can still go back pretty far in written records, and you have some historical records right?"
7,49,Gretchen,"Yeah, so in addition to Socrates there's a bunch of people complaining about Latin errors that people were making in kind of medieval Latin and being like 'these people they speak terrible Latin, they write terrible Latin' and a lot of those so-called errors became totally common and unremarkable conventions in the Romance languages, in French and Spanish, Italian and so on."
7,50,Lauren,Oh yeah all of the Romance languages are really quote unquote 'corrupted' forms of Latin but now we think of them as really fancy.
7,51,Gretchen,"Yeah. My favourite example - so I actually put a call out on Twitter for this because I just had a feeling that somebody must have complained about this at some point when English and French were kind of mixing together after the Norman conquest and Dave Sayers who's a linguist came to the rescue and pointed out that this historian, Bokenham, in 1440 has this long complaint. You can kind of understand it because it's Middle English at this point right, but I will not try to read the Middle English. I'll just read a part of the translation which says 'and this corruption of Englishmen in their mother tongue begun as I have said in the everyday admixture of first Danish then Norman, was greatly augmented and increased after the arrival of William the Conqueror by two things' and so on and so forth and then skipping to a later part of the paragraph 'and seeing this the rural people saw that they might seem to be the more esteemed and honourable and the more easily opened to the acquaintance of the worthy and the great, abandoned their mother tongue and laboured to be able to speak French, and thus in the course of time barbarise them both and spoke neither good French nor good English'."
7,52,Lauren,Ha! I love it so much! So basically the English we have now that is maybe a third lexical items borrowed from French would just upset this guy a lot.
7,53,Gretchen,"This guy was really mad, and I mean the ironic thing is of course he uses some French words in his complaint."
7,54,Lauren,Ahh yeah but they're the ok ones.
7,55,Gretchen,"Yeah, he uses words like 'corruption' and 'familiar' and 'augmentation' and 'honourable' and all of these words come from French in his complaint."
7,56,Lauren,That is so good.
7,57,Gretchen,but he's still really annoyed by this - 'they barbarise them both and speak neither good French nor good English'.
7,58,Lauren,Also known as modern English.
7,59,Gretchen,"Yep sorry, sorry guys!"
7,60,Lauren,"That is so good. So, peeving about how people are speaking today and how the modern generations are ruining language is a thing that we have a long and studied history of."
7,61,Gretchen,"But in 500 years or in a thousand years it's going to make you look like you didn't know what you were doing, so why not just skip that and not peeve in the first place!"
7,62,Lauren,"so people have been complaining about the way people talk for a very long time. But what I also find quite fascinating is often the things that people complain about young people doing aren't necessarily just done by young people, and a lot of the complaints about features of language that people find irritating are often found across their own generation as well but for some reason they kind of focus on young people doing it."
7,63,Gretchen,Perception bias isn't a thing right?!
7,64,Lauren,"Perception bias is, like, a massive thing here and 'like' is a really great example of this because there are some uses of 'like' that people find irritating but have been used for hundreds of years."
7,65,Gretchen,Yeah so there's a linguist who is kind of the—
7,66,Lauren,She's like the boss of 'like'.
7,67,Gretchen,"she is like the person who knows things about 'like' and her name is Alexandra D'Arcy and she's a linguist at University of Victoria in BC and she has done a whole bunch of stuff about 'like'. She's looked at different people's uses of it, perceptions of it, she's just come up with a book called '800 years of like', which is about how like has an eight hundred year history, I haven't read the book yet, I assume it's good."
7,68,Lauren,"She's really great and I love this, she's done quite a few interviews and I've read some of her shorter stuff so I feel confident in saying that the book would be good."
7,69,Gretchen,"Yes, she's done a great interview with Lexicon Valley, so you can check that out if you'd like more podcast things. And she's talked about 'like' and one of the points that she's made in one of her papers is that it's not randomly inserted. So one of the things that people have as a perception of 'like' is 'oh people are just throwing it around randomly and inserting it randomly'. She says no, you can actually characterize a bunch of different functions that it has and where each of those go with respect to other kinds of words. So there's the approximate of 'like' which is the one when you say 'what are we having for dinner?' 'Oh I don't know, like, pasta' which doesn't commit you to having specifically pasta but something in that general domain. Or there's quotative 'like', which is one of my favourites, which is when you say 'and then I was like' 'and then she was like' to introduce reported speech."
7,70,Lauren,I find it so useful.
7,71,Gretchen,"It's so useful. The cool thing about quotative 'like' is that you can use it to introduce some things that's not a direct quote. So you can say something like and 'I was like.' and then you can make a facial expression. Or you can use it to introduce what you're thinking rather than what you're saying, so you can say something like 'and I was like I can't believe this but I said 'oh really how interesting', so you can use the kind of manage the dichotomy around various different ways that you could react or that you could say in response to something. So it had a lot more subtlety than 'said'."
7,72,Lauren,"The evolution of 'like' and the fact that a lot of people use many of the uses. but young people continue to innovate interesting and stable uses of it, shows that people are really clever at language and that it's a very creative thing to do, but there are these like red flags that just go up for people when certain things happen and it is often only when young people do it. So an older person may use like in many similar ways but it flies under the radar."
7,73,Gretchen,"yeah. I think one of my favourite responses to the quotative 'like' thing is an XKCD comic we'll link to, and it's dialogue, and the first person says 'I found this article on the linguistics of quotative 'like,' like when you're like she was like'. It featured a quote from a linguist Patricia Cukor-Avila' - I don't know if I'm saying that right - 'eventually all people who hate this kind of thing are going to be dead and the ones who use it are going to be in control' and then the other character says 'wow linguists are pretty hardcore!' 'I think she means dead from old age. I'm gonna start saying 'like' more just in case!' So every linguist of my acquaintance posted about this being like 'we are hardcore, we're totally hardcore, thanks for recognising this xkcd'."
7,74,Lauren,"but I think this touches on an important thing that often gets lost or has historically gotten lost in the rhetoric around linguists being descriptive, it's a chicken and egg thing. What we're saying is 'this is what people do, isn't it an interesting phenomenon' and that's interpreted as linguists saying 'this is a good thing to do, so do it'. We're saying 'No, it's good because it's interesting to us'."
7,75,Gretchen,"It's there, it's just it's a reflection of what exists."
7,76,Lauren,And us saying that it's actually interesting and complex and has its own rules doesn't mean that we're necessarily advocating that you have to do this.
7,77,Gretchen,But I think we'd be putting our fingers in our ears and closing our eyes and going 'na na na na na I can't hear you' if we say 'oh this doesn't exist so we can't analyze it because it doesn't fit with our idea of what English should sound like'.
7,78,Lauren,"I think it's also important to acknowledge that just because we notice it's a phenomenon doesn't mean that we don't still encourage people to use appropriate language in appropriate domains. So something like quotative 'like' is I think completely acceptable, I use it all the time and I find it really useful but I definitely wouldn't encourage a student to use it in an essay, or in a formal email to a colleague at work."
7,79,Gretchen,"I think if I saw that in a novel I would still be surprised, you know novel tend to use 'said' still for dialogue tags but I think that, you know, language has multiple registers and multiple styles that are used in different environments but that doesn't mean that one of them has to be wrong, like we have different types of clothes that we wear for different situations that doesn't mean that there's only one kind of correct clothing. 'You must be wearing a three-piece suit and if you're not wearing that you might as well not even be wearing clothes at all!'"
7,80,Lauren,"I don't know, I wear my tuxedo around the house all the time! And that's part of, I mean I don't want to draw attention to our own languages because people have to listen to it but I definitely don't speak like I talk to you on the podcast in the same way as I do in a job interview, and we're probably even more informal when we're not trying to be articulate for podcasting."
7,81,Gretchen,"Or like with children, or with a pet or something, like you talk differently. But I think it's also worth pointing out that what we think of as formal and correct and so on when it comes to language is also based a lot on the existing power dynamics that happen in our society. So the type of English that we think of as the best English, it's not like anyone did a survey of all the English's and they analysed them for like their expressive capability and they were like 'after a sober consideration of the merits we've decided this one.'"
7,82,Lauren,"I think it one thing we probably should've flagged earlier on in the conversation is we're talking mostly about age based differences even though they're somewhat arbitrary here, but of course there are other socio-linguistic factors that this interacts with and there's gender - there's level of education and there's race and there's different dynamics happening in the UK and the US. All of this interplays, and I think sociolinguists, especially the ones who look at variation in different groups have always been really great at acknowledging a lot of these factors."
7,83,Gretchen,"Yeah. But we come into this saying 'well the type of English that's been considered the best is the kind that's you know modelled on Latin that's spoken by upper-class British dudes from like the 1800s, and that's a very particular type of English, it has no more particular merits than any other one but there are people who wanted to be associated with that type of group have been--"
7,84,Lauren,Perpetuating that standard.
7,85,Gretchen,Exactly.
7,86,Lauren,"Which is more or less accessible to different people and we acknowledge that and that's why it's important to teach, I think, the idea that there are genres and there are audiences, and the variety of English that you might speak at home or to your friends is not necessarily less valid, it's just not the 'genre appropriate'."
7,87,Gretchen,"Yeah, it's complicated because a lot of people get taught in school 'okay this is the right way to do things' or this is what' you need to do' and on the one hand you can say okay well the schools trying to give you the skills to survive in the world where people are going to judge you based on your language but they're also perpetuating the ideology that makes it okay to judge other people based on their language."
7,88,Lauren,"Yeah, and I used to be a bit of a peever and like feel like I kind of knew these three things about language but actually because I'm rubbish at spelling and because I've often had not the kind of default 'best accent' quote-unquote as an Australian in other contexts I kind of learnt really quickly that, like complaining about the way other people use language wasn't going to get me very far because I'm not always that standard at it myself."
7,89,Gretchen,"Yeah I think there's a lot of stuff around the Canadian accent, because it's not quite the same as the U.S., but Americans tend to have a very caricatured idea of what constitutes a Canadian accent. And then having a Nova Scotian accent within that I also have non standard features. But I think when I was initially interested in language it often gets conflated, the idea that 'oh you're interested in linguistics so you must also be interested in like judging people's grammar'."
7,90,Lauren,Yeah I got a bunch of those books from people early on.
7,91,Gretchen,"And you know if I meet people at parties and they're like 'oh you're a linguist I guess I better watch how I talk around you!' I'm like 'no no no please don't!' - well, I mean, I'm interested in what you're doing but like I'm going to analyse your vowels, I don't want to criticise you for them."
7,92,Lauren,"That's the thing I find interesting is these like complaints about language tend to centre on the same things again and again. Whether or not people use 'like' all over the place is one of them, people are really obsessed with 'literally', literally obsessed."
7,93,Gretchen,"Hyperbolic literally. I mean hyperbole is a thing, hyperbole is a real thing that people do. I don't think anyone complains that saying like 'I told you once I've told you a million times' like suddenly no one understands what million means anymore."
7,94,Lauren,"Yeah, you know like everyone's pretty chill about fabulous meaning that something's pretty good these days. No one's like 'I'm sorry but it doesn't pertain to fables why are using the word fabulous'."
7,95,Gretchen,"I mean, to be honest I actually don't think we're being pedantic enough about 'literally', because it literally means pertaining to a letter, and so if you're not using literal to mean pertaining to the alphabet I think you're using it wrong."
7,96,Lauren,"If you are not struck down by absolute pure awe, the thing is not awesome."
7,97,Gretchen,"True, true! But also awesome and awful mean the same thing and like if you use them to mean different things you're, you know..."
7,98,Lauren,"Yeah, so once you start it's like a levelling up right, like you start and you're like 'oh language has rules and here are a few I've learnt and I'm going to be judging other people for not also knowing these secret club rules'. And then you learn that actually all language is somewhat arbitrary and changing all the time. And a lot of things that people take as hardcore rules and don't like other people not doing were at their own time like arbitrary, non-standard uses and then you feel a bit more relaxed about things."
7,99,Gretchen,"Yeah, like etymology is really fun, I like learning where words come from and 'oh these three words actually have this hidden connection' -- that's really interesting, it's just not the 'true' meaning of the word. There's a nice graph by Rob Drummond that illustrates this, which we can link to, and it kind of shows that when you start learning things about language often your knowledge about language and your pedantry increase in lockstep with each other and then at a certain point your knowledge about language levels off for a bit - it's a stylised graph - and your pedantry just massively increases, and then as you keep learning more you realise there's actually no point in being pedantic about it and in fact your pedantry goes right the way down. And instead you start getting really annoyed by people who are who are annoyed about language as your knowledge about language keeps increasing, and so trying to move as rapidly as possible into that final stage."
7,100,Lauren,It's pretty zen over this side I have to say.
7,101,Gretchen,It's really good for your blood pressure to not be a pedant!
7,102,Lauren,"Yeah. A lot of what we've been talking about as well has been presuming that it's older people complaining about what younger people do, but Allie Severin at Monash University did a really great thesis on looking at older and younger people who have feelings about non-standard grammar usage and things like spelling 'there' 'their' and 'they're'. And some people move through to this trajectory younger or older"
7,103,Gretchen,"Mm-hmm and it's not exclusively an age thing, I mean, it's also gender, it's also race, it's also class, it's level of education. You spend five or ten years figuring out 'okay this is how you should use it' then in reward you can get very self-righteous about apostrophes when it comes to other people. And that's been very good for my sense of relaxation and sense of calm to be like 'actually what I'm really interested in is just tracking the decline of 'whom' and the bizarre circumstances under which people use it to try to sound fancy even when that's not historically the right environment'. It becomes an interesting question -- you can say 'let's look at this analytically.' One of the ones that I'm tracking is the combination of 'a lot' with no space, because historically we've done this with the words like 'alright' and 'albeit' and 'altogether'."
7,104,Lauren,And 'a lot' is heading that way too.
7,105,Gretchen,"It's heading that way, for perfectly good historical reasons -- it's not used like 'a (pause) lot'."
7,106,Lauren,"We've kind of touched on the fact that a lot of these changes that happen that people decry are often indicators of creativity and they can be predictors of actually good language skills. So Nenagh Kemp has been doing, I have a post from 2011 here but she's been doing some work at the University of Tasmania over the years looking at the texting skills and literacy skills of young students, and as a general predictor just because a student is really using a lot of informal language in their text messages doesn't mean that they're going to be using that in classrooms as well. If they're educated in using the right language for the right audience, they can generally show good literacy skills, and they're capable of using one type of language with their friends and another in testing situations. So just because people do use non-standard forms in some context doesn't mean that they're actually bad at language."
7,107,Gretchen,"I'm going to invoke XKCD again, I can't believe I get to to cite XKCD twice in the same episode, but there's another XKCD comic which we'll also link to, where one character says 'Another study found that kids who use SMS abbreviations actually score higher on grammar and spelling tests' and the other characters says 'Well why on earth is that a surprise? Imagine kids suddenly start playing catch literally all the time. Everywhere they go they throw balls back and forth, toss them in the air, hurl them at trees and signs nearly every waking hour their lives, do you think their generation will suck at baseball because they learn sloppy skills?'."
7,108,Lauren,"It's true, it keeps you playing around with language more and thinking about it more often."
7,109,Gretchen,"And I think that being reflexive about your own languages is something that can also happen in an informal setting. If you think about sending a text to someone that you have a crush on or that you need to break up with these are very high stakes social interactions -- you might get three friends to read over your texts with you and say 'do you think this struck the right note, like is this what I should be saying, did I use the wrong thing?'"
7,110,Lauren,'should there be a full stop there?'
7,111,Gretchen,"Yeah! Someone tagged me on Twitter in a thread about sitting on a train as she was watching a middle-aged woman composing an entirely emoji text that had various combinations of happy emoji, you know like the party one, and the smiling face, and the heart, and so on and she composed and composed and deleted this text several times with different combinations of emojis because she was trying to strike the right aesthetic balance. And I think that if you think of good writing as writing that is self-reflexive and accomplishes its goals, I think that people are doing a lot of that when it comes to texting or other types of internet and media communication."
7,112,Lauren,"And often it can be hard to figure out the generation that is using the non standard forms, and why they're using them. So I have a really nice example from my family where I have text messages from my mid-20s sister and my late 80s grandfather, and my grandfather was the one using all the short forms and half-finished sentences and really kind of flexible slangy language because he learned to do telegrams in the war so he's used to really shortened forms, and smashing those really awkward non-smartphone keys is really hard for him. Whereas my sister uses a swype keyboard so it's easier for her to use standard language in that context so you get the inverse of what people generally presumes happens across generations."
7,113,Gretchen,"Mm-hmm and even the kids saying -- I heard this from David Crystal, who'd been talking to some high school kids and they said 'oh we don't use these textisms any more because that's what our parents do and that's not cool!' Nobody wants to be like their parents."
7,114,Lauren,Yup! So it's driving standardised language in text messages.
7,115,Gretchen,"Another way that you can look at writing quality is in sheer number of words, because obviously if you write the most words that is the best. I'm kidding a little bit here, but there's a really interesting study that looked at this, Andrea Lunsford and Karen Lunsford looked at a longitudinal study of student writing across the decades and so they looked at papers from like American college students, first-year University students in 1917, 1930, 1986, and 2006."
7,116,Lauren,"Cool, what a spread."
7,117,Gretchen,"Yeah, so it's almost a hundred years of different points in what students in first-year composition writing classes are doing, and they found a couple really interesting things. One is that they found that the essay writing, the number of words per essay, has increased by 10 times."
7,118,Lauren,What?!
7,119,Gretchen,Yeah! So in 1917 the students wrote an average of a hundred and sixty two words per essay.
7,120,Lauren,That's not an essay that's a paragraph!
7,121,Gretchen,Well it was written by hand in like big fountain pens so I guess it looks like it an essay!
7,122,Lauren,"Yeah yeah, fair enough."
7,123,Gretchen,"And in 1986 they wrote 422 words, and in 2006 they wrote over a thousand words."
7,124,Lauren,Wow.
7,125,Gretchen,"And so then the number of words they've written is greatly increased, but what's interesting is that the number of errors stayed remarkably constant over 100 years. So students in are making the same number of errors, but they made different errors."
7,126,Lauren,"Okay, that kind of makes sense."
7,127,Gretchen,"So in the earlier studies the biggest, biggest error was spelling errors. But now the students aren't making spelling errors anymore because they're computer processing their papers, and they have spellcheck now. So now the biggest error became wrong word -- they're using spellcheck but they pick the wrong word. Another thing that's changed is what the writing instructors prioritise, because how they decided whether something was an error, is they had a bunch of University professors mark the papers, the professors decided what to consider an error and one of the big errors that showed up in 2006 was incomplete or missing documentation, meaning they did the citations wrong - but in 1917 they weren't even expecting students to write citations!"
7,128,Lauren,"So 'the kids, doing okay' is basically the take away."
7,129,Gretchen,The kids are doing okay.
7,130,Lauren,"Once you become aware of the fact that a lot of this change isn't as strongly generational as we think it is, and it often actually shows really positive things about younger people's language use, it seems like quite a bizarre thing to be so hung up on complaining about what the kids are doing these days."
7,131,Gretchen,"I think language is a thing you can project a lot of your other worries on, so any worries you have about the kids you can project on their language. So I want to coin a term, Lauren, can I coin a term?"
7,132,Lauren,"Okay this is your one term that you can coin for this episode, go"
7,133,Gretchen,"I think there's a problem when it comes to people dismissing the ideas contained in an argument because it's coached in terms that are not prestigious linguistically, so saying that 'you said something and you've used an apostrophe wrong in it so I can dismiss what you've said because you used the apostrophe wrong' without engaging with whether or not the argument itself is good. Or conversely 'oh you made this argument and you said it in eloquent terms so I should give it more more credence'. And I think this is a logical fallacy, and I think this is a logical fallacy that's kind of like an ad hominem attack where you say 'oh well you're ugly so your argument isn't good' I want to call it an 'ad vocem' attack, which is when you attack someone's voice instead of their argument."
7,134,Lauren,I feel like I'm more compelled by your argument because you've used this fancy Latinate term that you've made up.
7,135,Gretchen,I needed to take advantage of my misspent Latin education.
7,136,Lauren,I don't even know if it's /vokem/ or /vosem/.
7,137,Gretchen,"This is what I love, it's like there's no right way to say it, it could be /vokem/ it could be /vɑsem/, it could be /vɑkem/, I don't know! There's like four right things! If you criticize someone for the one they pick you're doing it!"
7,138,Lauren,So are you default required to always vacillate and choose a different one each time just to keep people on their toes?
7,139,Gretchen,"Yeah! I've been thinking about this term because we were planning this episode and I was thinking 'I think there should be word for this' and I'm very inconsistent myself with how I say it and I think that's great, I think that there's allowed to be multiple competing standards. If you want to engage in an argument in good faith, the way to do that is not to be persnickety about how someone saying it and say 'what are the ideas, do they have merits?'. Someone can be an eloquent orator and still have terrible, terrible ideas. But if you name it as logical fallacy and if you coach it in the terms of like 'oh it's Latinate, it's fancy' then maybe that's something we can borrow, some prestige from Latin to say 'nobody wants to do a logical fallacy!' Like this is a thing that we should recognize in ourselves. And if you are someone who likes calling people out on stuff, the fun part is by switching over to being more tolerant about language you then get to call out all the people who are being critical about it instead of the people who are using apostrophes correctly, so you still a group of people to get annoyed at, but you get to feel like you're contributing to a more positive cause."
7,140,Lauren,"I think it also means that you can give people more useful feedback on language use, so instead of saying 'don't use this form' you can say 'in a formal essay don't do this, you can still use that in text messages'."
7,141,Gretchen,"You can say things like 'the conventions of the genre are as follows, if you'd like to not follow the conventions of the genre that's a decision you can make, but you should be aware that this is what the conventions are'. Another takeaway is if you look at what kids actually do when they're exposed to fragmented or incomplete linguistic input, they actually create full-fledged languages from kind of bizarre or difficult linguistic circumstances."
7,142,Lauren,"A really famous example of this that we have is Nicaraguan Sign Language, and the fact that we've taken until episode 7 to talk about it it's actually pretty impressive because it's such a great go to anecdote for linguists, and such an amazing thing that happened. In the 70s and 80s in Nicaragua there was a change in policy that meant that a lot of deaf children suddenly came together at school instead of being isolated and using their own home sign or maybe a little local village sign language. And they came together and these children over the course of a couple of generations went from all having kind of only a rudimentary communicative system to developing what is now considered to be a fully fledged language, which is Nicaraguan Sign Language. And there are around three thousand users of sign language now, it's got its own ISO language code, and the great thing is it's been studied since its birth. Since the 1970s, there have been people watching the evolution of this language and how children can use limited resources and inputs to create something really sophisticated."
7,143,Gretchen,"Yeah, so it teaches us a lot about the human and the human child capacity for language and what you can do with that. So if ever we have disrupted or interrupted linguistics transmission it's actually going to be the kids that save us. They're not going to bring us back to what we had before but they're going to make a fully fledged linguistic system that's capable of complex ideas and complex thoughts. And this brings us back to a point from episode one where we talked about the language of space."
7,144,Lauren,And our space babies!
7,145,Gretchen,"And how the American and the Russian astronauts and cosmonauts use each other's languages and use this hybrid English-Russian pidgin to communicate with each other. But because all the astronauts so far have been adults this is kind of an incomplete, fragmented English-Russian hybrid space pidgin. However, if and when we go to Mars, the astronauts and the cosmonauts might get together and have some space babies."
7,146,Lauren,If there were children...
7,147,Gretchen,Then these space babies would grow up exposed to space pidgin and they would turn it into space creole.
7,148,Lauren,"And it would actually develop more sophisticated grammatical structures, the children wll take the input that they get and turn it into a more fully fledged linguistic system. So the kids in space are going to be okay."
7,149,Gretchen,"The kids in space are going to be okay, the kids on earth are going to be okay, we're all okay. Also, someone needs to write this story about space babies, I would like to read it."
7,150,Lauren,I would definitely love to read about babies in space standardising English-Russian pidgin into a creole.
7,151,Gretchen,"Write us about space babies, this is what I want to see![Theme music]"

8,4,Lauren,"Today we are talking dictionaries, which is a super exciting genre of book for linguists! This topic choice is for a number of reasons. The first of which is that Kory Stamper's new book 'Word By Word' came out a couple of months ago and we both read it and we had the best fun reading it and we wanted to talk about it so much that we ended up just talking about it for this whole episode. The whole episode will kind of be framed around Kory's book and some of the things that we really enjoyed about reading it, but that is not the only reason, is it Gretchen?"
8,5,Gretchen,"Yeah, and we're also going to be talking about other stuff to do with dictionaries because I was recently on a panel about dictionaries at South by Southwest, and I also got to meet Kory and hang out with some other dictionary people -- when she gave a talk in New York City I happen to be going down on that specific day."
8,6,Lauren,And so this episode will be another episode in the genre of 'Gretchen makes Lauren really jealous by telling her about all the cool linguist and lexicography peeps that she got to hang out with'.
8,7,Gretchen,You just need to come here and come to a conference and then I can introduce you to everybody and it'll be great!
8,8,Lauren,"Yeah, but for now we're all going to live vicariously through Gretchen's excellent adventures."
8,9,Gretchen,"Okay so I got to have drinks with like -- this is a great group of people -- because I messaged Kory and I was like, hey let's meet up! and she was like, 'but only if you can come to drinks with these other amazing people' and I was like, 'oh I don't know if I could handle that!'"
8,10,Lauren,"Awww tough, so tough!"
8,11,Gretchen,"So I got to have drinks with Ben Zimmer, who we've mentioned many times on this podcast, who I already knew, and does the word column for Wall Street Journal, and Jesse Sheidlower who does the word column for the New Yorker, and Katherine Connor Martin who is the head of U.S. dictionaries for the Oxford English Dictionary, she was very cool. And also the like stealth excited person to be on this list was Lauren Naturale who runs the Merriam-Webster Twitter account."
8,12,Lauren,"That is so exciting - I mean, another excellent Lauren."
8,13,Gretchen,"Another excellent Lauren -- all Laurens are excellent! And so in case you're not on Twitter and haven't noticed the Merriam-Webster Twitter account, it has been making waves a lot recently for doing some really cool and funny and topical tweets."
8,14,Lauren,"I was going to say, it's very on topic."
8,15,Gretchen,"It's very on the nose, so something will happen in the news or in politics, and they'll call that out, so they've been really really trenchant these days, and so I was very excited about that. I mean, I was excited about the other people too, but I was like, Lauren is there!"
8,16,Lauren,"Their Twitter account, to give you an idea of just how popular it is, has won a Webby Award - they've won three Webby awards at Merriam-Webster, which are kind of an indication that they have appeal beyond people who may have traditionally been fans of lexicography and dictionaries."
8,17,Gretchen,"I think my favourite Merriam-Webster tweet, and this is kind of a classic one, this is like the first one I noticed when they were really being topical and being kind of sassy, is when they tweeted 'People keep 1) saying they don't know what 'genderqueer' means then 2) asking why we added it to the dictionary'."
8,18,Lauren,I always like their very on topic word of the days which often kind of just allude to something that is in the media or is kind of on topic.
8,19,Gretchen,"Yeah, like when people were talking about alternative facts they tweeted a definition of facts. Not fax machines, F-A-C-T-S. So yeah, there are some great Merriam-Webster tweets and I think they're a fun example of cool things you can do with the dictionary as an authority and yet trying to break down some of the ways that dictionaries are seen as very static and fussy and trying to bring them into the 21st century."
8,20,Lauren,"And I think that's part of the appeal, as well for why I found Kory's book so appealing - Word By Word is kind of an insider's look at how a dictionary gets made. She's been an editor at Merriam-Webster for 15 years or so and it takes you through the machinations of how dictionaries get made, a kind of an unglamorous sausage factory approach to that process."
8,21,Gretchen,"But it was really cool because I was really able to picture it and now I feel like, you know, if I went there - hopefully someday maybe I'll go there - to the Merriam-Webster office in Springfield, Massachusetts - and she's describing like the old-school filing cabinets and drawers and drawers and shelves and boxes of citations. So if you're going to find examples for words they read all these magazines and newspapers and all of this stuff to find the words the people are using differently that aren't in the dictionary yet or that should be updated. You know people bring in like cereal boxes and take photos of signs while they're on vacation and use them as examples and stuff as well. Just like figuring out how all of the stuff works, it was really fun."
8,22,Lauren,And you got to talk to a whole panel of people who make dictionaries as part of the South by Southwest talk that you went and did a couple of months ago now.
8,23,Gretchen,"It was in March, yeah. I did a panel with Erin McKean of Wordnik, Jane Solomon of dictionary.com and Ben Zimmer who I've already mentioned, who I saw a lot in March. So we did a panel about dictionaries, tech and the future at South by Southwest and we talked about, you know, how do you construct a dictionary? How do you decide what to let into the dictionary? So Erin's approach with Wordnik, which kind of reimagines the dictionary away from the tradition of the paper dictionary, which is very limited in how many pages you can have. Erin's approach with Wordnik is if someone has searched for it, we'll give you a page that has whatever information we have, and if no one has searched for it before and no one has added anything to that page there's nothing on it -- but for many words there is stuff on it. So I asked them, is there any thought of adding emoji to the dictionary? The 'face with tears of joy emoji' was Oxford's Word of the Year 2015 I think. I asked them are you going to add emoji in there and Erin said well you can search for emoji on Wordnik - for a lot of them you might not find very much information but you can search for them. You know they've got this kind of crowd-sourced approach to adding stuff about particular words in addition to the base dictionary that they started with, so people can add information."
8,24,Lauren,"Dictionaries are in an interesting state of flux at the moment, I think it's fair to say very few people are buying or interacting with paper dictionaries. More and more people are using online resources exclusively, and also dictionary makers are moving from using written things to add to the dictionary and searching online corpora instead. So that leads to some interesting ways in which dictionaries will change."
8,25,Gretchen,"And people who are using dictionaries themselves -- not just dictionary makers that are using electronic sources, but people who are searching for words in a dictionary rather than opening up... you know I have a bunch of dictionaries on my shelf, I'm looking over and seeing them right now, I have dictionaries for several languages on my shelf, but when was the last time I pulled one off and opened it and used it for something? It's not very often, because I'm like 'well I'm already at my computer'. I can just search for the word there."
8,26,Lauren,"Which I think is really great in terms of usability and accessibility. I think it it makes us feel like the dictionary -- it's the same problem that journalism and a lot of other industries have as well -- we feel like we're entitled to dictionaries, even more than we have ever felt throughout history. I think again one thing I really loved about Word By Word, is the book shows you that it's a massive labour to write a dictionary and to keep it up to date, and this is real work that has to be done by real humans, computers aren't actually that good at doing that work."
8,27,Gretchen,"Yeah, we have this perception that there's 'a dictionary', and I trolled my panel because I was moderating them and I said 'okay which one of you is 'the dictionary'? like do we have a fight here?'"
8,28,Lauren,Did you find out which one is 'the dictionary'?
8,29,Gretchen,"They all claimed it, it was very disappointing! But we have a perception that the dictionary is like a faceless thing that doesn't even have a brand name in some cases, and that all of them are essentially equivalent to each other and it doesn't matter if you're using a 50 year old one, maybe it's better, even though it's going to not have words from the past 50 years and so on. And one of things I liked about Kory's book is the way she talked about this construction of authority. In fact, dictionaries constructed that authority for themselves, like people didn't come out of nowhere with this idea that the dictionary was a thing you should look to for all your answers, that was in early dictionary ad campaigns. Merriam-Webster and so on were using this to sell dictionaries, to say this is where you should get all your information like they have this ask the editor feature you can write in and get answers on anything and that was a big selling feature and Kory tweets about some of the funny things people ask her."
8,30,Lauren,"Kory has an excellent blog, I really hoped this book would be as excellent as the blog 'Harmless Drudgery', we'll put that in the show notes, she certainly has a good approach to dealing with people's ways of engaging with dictionaries."
8,31,Gretchen,"Yeah, she's got a really funny voice, she's got a great sense of humour and the book was fun and I was basically positive I was going to like it because I liked her blog and Twitter so much."
8,32,Lauren,"Yeah, sorry, you thought this was a review episode it's actually just a fangirl episode."
8,33,Gretchen,"Yeah! It's one of those things where you try to do a balanced review and you're like 'oh these are the pros and cons', but there weren't any cons, because the book did exactly what it should do, which was great, so I have no complaints!"
8,34,Lauren,"So yeah, they have this idea of authority, and you know I personally just thought of dictionaries as dictionaries, and I used whichever one my school gave me. I think the social media presence of dictionaries is actually helping me feel like they have personalities."
8,35,Gretchen,"Yeah, I think I thought of dictionaries as kind of like the periodic table, you know like everyone has gotten this consensus - or like the phone book. The phone book just is -- it's not like someone had to sit down and decide. I guess someone did decide who got each number but that's not something that's very transparent to you when you use the phone book. They're both good if you have a child and they need to be propped up on a seat you can give them a nice thick dictionary or phone book to sit on, so that's useful."
8,36,Lauren,They have multiple functions! I feel like there's a whole bunch of dictionary makers that are like very sad at you right now for that.
8,37,Gretchen,"No, they sell copies, are you kidding me?! They're all trying to increase their print sales of the unabridged version!"
8,38,Lauren,"I didn't really ever have full respect for lexicographers until I had to make a dictionary as part of my work on Lamjung Yolmo, which is a Tibetan language that I worked on for my PhD. People get really upset in grant proposals and proper linguistic stuff when I talk about it being a dictionary because it is technically a 'bilingual wordlist of translations', but the thing is the speakers of the language refer to it as a dictionary, it's as close to a dictionary as anyone is going to write for that language anytime soon."
8,39,Gretchen,So is that because you weren't defining the words in Yolmo?
8,40,Lauren,"Yeah, a dictionary should technically be the word and then it's definition using that language to define it."
8,41,Gretchen,"I mean, I have a French-English dictionary and a German-English dictionary and they still call themselves dictionaries."
8,42,Lauren,"Noooo, they would be 'translation word lists'."
8,43,Gretchen,"Well, you tell that to Larousse."
8,44,Lauren,"Yeah exactly. To be honest, it's not like the forefront of my skill set and there are definitely like eight different entries that just translate as 'green leafy edible vegetable', so that gave me a level of respect for lexicography I didn't have before."
8,45,Gretchen,"When you're writing a dictionary from scratch how do you go about doing that? Do you just start writing down words you know, or do you go systematically, do you go in alphabetical order, how do you make that choice?"
8,46,Lauren,In terms of the one that I made?
8,47,Gretchen,"Yeah, because in Kory's books she's talking about how they go through the alphabet, but a lot of what they're doing is they're revising the definitions that already exist. Because English has a several hundred year tradition of dictionary making, that means that our dictionaries don't start from scratch anymore. They start from the previous edition or from some previous thing and they revise it and they update it and so they have this kind of entrenched bureaucracy there already. But I imagine if you're creating a dictionary or word list from scratch like where do you go from there?"
8,48,Lauren,"The thing we made was definitely more ad hoc and opportunistic. If you document a language there are some word lists that people encourage you to use, to get the basic vocabulary, and then a lot of it came from stories and other texts that we collected and some of them just came from, you know... they make a lot of bamboo baskets, so one day I just sat there with one of the women and she was making a basket I was like 'What's that called? What's that called?' and I think it's probably like the most irritating day of work she has ever had."
8,49,Gretchen,But now all this basket vocabulary is documented.
8,50,Lauren,"Yep, but it's not comprehensive, I think a lot of especially English dictionaries try and sell themselves on their comprehensiveness, but with Yolmo this was much more a kind of opportunistic output of what was done within the documentation."
8,51,Gretchen,So then if someone was trying to make a more comprehensive dictionary they could use that as a starting point and then get some more and kind of keep building on that.
8,52,Lauren,Yeah.
8,53,Gretchen,"Yeah, I've heard of people doing things where you get a get a couple of speakers and you sit down and say 'okay, today we're going to talk about body parts', or 'today we're going to talk about family terms'."
8,54,Lauren,"One time I was in Nepal and I spent a week watching a Rapid Words workshops, a dictionary workshop, happen. Which is that they got 40 speakers of Syuba, which is the language I work with at the moment, they bought them all to a single place together for two weeks. There's this very very elaborate semantic set that gets used and they were given all these worksheets and it was like 'right today name all the words in relation to house building, name all the words in relation to women's clothing'. So they have hundreds of semantic prompts."
8,55,Gretchen,And these are things that most languages have some words around?
8,56,Lauren,"Yeah, sometimes they're big like 'name all of the astrological phenomena in the sky' and sometimes they're much more specific."
8,57,Gretchen,And I guess it might depend you know if you have a language only spoken in a landlocked region they probably don't have a lot of words to do with the ocean.
8,58,Lauren,"Yeah, and so they ended up pulling together about 20,000 words, some of which were overlaps, but within two weeks they built the guts of a dictionary, it was a very efficient machine."
8,59,Gretchen,Wow. And then so someone has to go through and collate all those worksheets and put them together and compare all the words that everybody wrote down?
8,60,Lauren,"They had a pool of people typing it up, it was a kind of factory dictionary building, in a really cool way."
8,61,Gretchen,"Wow, that's really interesting."
8,62,Lauren,"I wrote an article about that and I'll link to it in the show notes. So for those two examples the words that were getting in are just all of the words, we're kind of starting from scratch, we're literally adding words like 'cat' and 'dog' and 'person', and really basic vocabulary."
8,63,Gretchen,"And you might have a harder time with even grammatical words or something like that because it's a lot harder to be like 'list all the function words in your language' or 'list all of the propositions in your language'. I mean, maybe you could do prepositions by asking about locations, but like 'list all of the the particles' or something would be harder, you'd want to do a grammatical description for that."
8,64,Lauren,"One thing you get a sense of from Kory's book is that people who are trained to do lexicography and dictionary editing have a very finely tuned sense of language, and this is not what was happening for us, this was a very basic word collection. But dictionary writers and people who are figuring out definitions have to kind of have a very finely tuned sense of the slight differences between very similar words, or different senses of a single word."
8,65,Gretchen,"Yeah, I think the example Kory had was 'measly', it's like measly is a small amount but it's also kind of small and mean, it's not a good small. So having this sense, she called it 'sprachgefühl', which is the German word for the feeling of a language and I liked that. Kory walked us through the sense of how she and Emily Brewster defined a new sense of the word 'a' - 'a' as in 'an apple', er I mean, 'a' as in 'a banana'! And you know, you think you know approximately what this word does but they noticed there was another thing that it was doing. Emily figured out exactly how to describe and characterise the particular sense that hadn't been described. So if you're doing very initial dictionary building for a language that doesn't have one you may not be trying to catalogue all of the possible senses for every single word, you're saying we need to kind of get down a word list as much as possible and then we can work on refining it more later, there's a lot of different stages."
8,66,Lauren,"But dictionaries at some point become big enough that they have to kind of start deciding -- especially for a language like English where there are so many speakers in so many parts of the world and English is used in so many domains, it's the language of day-to-day chat for people, it's a language of law, it's a language of science it has a lot of domains in which it operates and so it has a lot of vocabulary that may not be in other languages but that needs to be defined."
8,67,Gretchen,"Yeah, but which you might not want to have a standard dictionary, you may not want to have every name of every possible chemical compound in a small hand-sized dictionary."
8,68,Lauren,", Yeah, and like some words that may have not been updated for a long time suddenly become very topical, and suddenly need some attention. There's a really nice quote from Sue Butler back in 2012. In Australia the word misogyny suddenly became very topical because we had a female prime minister who was trying to call out some misogynistic behaviour."
8,69,Gretchen,"She gave that great speech in Parliament, it was good."
8,70,Lauren,"She did, and Sue had a very busy week because that was something that people were looking up a lot. She said 'I always think of myself as the person with a mop and broom and a bucket coming in and cleaning up after the party's over. In this case it was a fairly big party and what was left on the floor was misogyny'. So sometimes a word will become popular again and a dictionary hasn't really touched their definition for a while, or suddenly lexicographers are being called on to talk about these topics and that might be a word that had been neglected and not in an abridged dictionary is suddenly an important and useful word again."
8,71,Gretchen,"Yeah, like a politician will use an obscure word in a speech or a debate or something and everyone kind of goes 'I kinda know what that means but I'm not quite sure let me go look that up' and then 'oh we haven't touched the definition in years.'"
8,72,Lauren,"I do like how Merriam-Webster will talk about which words are trending in terms of they haven't been looked up for a while and suddenly people are, and is often related to something that is happening."
8,73,Gretchen,"Yeah, several of the dictionaries do that it's great."
8,74,Lauren,And it's one of the nice things about these new online dictionaries and that they're using this data of who's interacting and how they're interacting with a dictionary. I find it so fascinating.
8,75,Gretchen,"I think it's also interesting because when we made paper books and sent them to people you had no idea what people are looking at. Some of the earlier earliest English dictionaries were like a table of hard words, so they wouldn't even include the basic words because they were like 'well everybody knows you know what 'love' is or what a 'mother' is or something like that we don't need to put that in we're going to put, you know, 'indefatigable' or something like that in our dictionaries because people look that up, it's hard'."
8,76,Lauren,Yeah.
8,77,Gretchen,indeFAtigable? inDEfatigable?
8,78,Lauren,"I don't know, and you should look it up in the dictionary to see how it's pronounced."
8,79,Gretchen,"Yeah exactly! But what they found is that when you put them online you can use stats, you have you have visitor stats now and a lot of people do look up words like 'love' and 'mother' and they wanna express their feelings. Kind of like you go to the drugstore and you look through all the cards and try to find something that really sums up what you want to say about your feelings for your mother - sometimes people go to the dictionary for that."
8,80,Lauren,'You are a good female parent'.
8,81,Gretchen,"Or on Valentine's Day they look up what love is because they want the dictionary to put that into words for them. I don't think the lexicographers really think of themselves as greeting card writers, they're just trying to describe how people are already using the word rather than give you a nice pithy thing to put in your greeting cards."
8,82,Lauren,"I mean, that's probably a very obvious point that we maybe just need to make very explicit, and that dictionary makers are still trying to make explicit after years of claiming themselves to be the authority, but a dictionary is being descriptive, it's describing how people are using language commonly at the time the dictionary is published. They're not trying to tell you how a word has to be used."
8,83,Gretchen,"I think there is a history of dictionaries that did try to tell people how to use words though, like they came by that reputation honestly. It's just they have now disavowed that because they've realised that it's kind of a jerk thing to do."
8,84,Lauren,"Yeah. One way that some dictionaries do this and the Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principles, is the most famous and probably the most comprehensive in English, is by using historical quotes to provide supporting evidence for their definition and the change in a words meaning over time. Which is the something that I take for granted, but I use all the time, it is such a useful feature of dictionaries."
8,85,Gretchen,And Oxford lists its definitions in order of which ones came first whereas most other dictionaries list their definitions in order for which one's most common. If you go to the Oxford definition and you see the first meaning and you're like 'that's not what I would use this for' it's like 'no that's not how you use it now but that's how people used it 50 years ago or 300 years ago or something like that.'
8,86,Lauren,"I'm always surprised. Words are always older than I think they are and this recency illusion is something people talk about a lot and we all think that language has changed when we see it having been different, but I have a surprisingly large number of posts on Superlinguo where it's like 'ah turns out g-strings are older than I thought, the word 'hipster'? much older than I thought' and I really love that feature."
8,87,Gretchen,"How old are g-strings, Lauren?."
8,88,Lauren,The oldest citation for 'g-string' that the OED has... do you want to have a guess?
8,89,Gretchen,"Um, 1920s?"
8,90,Lauren,Earlier.
8,91,Gretchen,"Oh, I was thinking the roaring 20s."
8,92,Lauren,"I'll give you a clue, the entry for 'g-string' hasn't been updated since 1933."
8,93,Gretchen,Oh God.
8,94,Lauren,"Which is like when it was published, probably."
8,95,Gretchen,"Like, 1850s?"
8,96,Lauren,"1878, so within that window."
8,97,Gretchen,"Yeah, still the Victorians."
8,98,Lauren,"It was first used 'gee-string' g-e-e string, as a description of the loin cloths of Native Americans, is the first written citation that we have, I'll link to that in the show notes."
8,99,Gretchen,So it wasn't initially like dancers and stuff?
8,100,Lauren,"No, I first came across it because I was reading 'The Talented Mr. Ripley' which was published in 1955 and I was like 'oh that's much earlier than I thought' and it's even earlier than that."
8,101,Gretchen,"Oh yeah, I think of it as being whenever pole dancing became popular, around that period."
8,102,Lauren,"Nope older than that. And people have this sport of trying to find older, to antedate the earliest reference. Again, warning, it's always the earliest written reference that we have, right, especially for slangy or informal words, people were probably saying them long before they were written down. Especially for anything before the modern era I guess? Or maybe the Victorian era? You see a lot of stuff is, like, letters from that era."
8,103,Gretchen,"Yeah, letters and newspapers and ad campaigns, advertisers tend to be trying to pick up on modern slang, and newspapers sometimes are closer to slang and they have a much shorter production time than a book. Depending on the newspaper I mean. The New Yorker is still writing 'cöoperative' with a diaeresis over the 'o'."
8,104,Lauren,Which is the two dots.
8,105,Gretchen,Just because they want to be 'those' people.
8,106,Lauren,"While we're talking about the OED's historical quotes, probably a good time to shout out to another book that is worth reading on dictionary making. This is a piece of pseudo fiction if I'm not mistaken?"
8,107,Gretchen,I haven't actually read it but I've been hearing about it for a while.
8,108,Lauren,I read it and now I just can't remember if it was fiction or not but it was very compelling it's called 'The Surgeon of Crowthorne'.
8,109,Gretchen,It's based on a true story but I think it may have some poetic license taken. I heard of it as 'The Professor and the Madman' which I guess it was retitled for the North American audience.
8,110,Lauren,"Yeah, it has two different names."
8,111,Gretchen,They're also making it into a movie now with Mel Gibson so depending on how much you like Mel Gibson....
8,112,Lauren,"The book is by Simon Winchester who also wrote a nonfiction account of the early years of the Oxford English Dictionary and I'm intrigued, I mean it's really great that we're going to have a Hollywood film about the OED! So stay tuned!"
8,113,Gretchen,We can add it to the list of linguist movies with 'Arrival' and 'My Fair Lady' and... that's... that's it.
8,114,Lauren,"Yeah three, woo!"
8,115,Gretchen,Three! But like two of them in the past couple years that's very exciting.
8,116,Lauren,That becomes technically a movie marathon so that is a fabulous development.
8,117,Gretchen,"There's also other national dictionaries, so there's a dictionary of 'Canadianisms on Historical Principles' and there's Canadian versions of the OED and stuff. The dictionary of Canadianisms on Historical Principles has recently done an update and they have a very extensive, I think it's about 3,000 words on 'eh' and how it's used in Canada, so that was great I really enjoyed that. And they also have various other Canadian regionalisms which took me back to the time I took a Canadian English course once in undergrad."
8,118,Lauren,"And I'm going to give my local shout out to the Australian National Dictionary Centre who are affiliated with the OED and work specifically on Australian lexical terms. The first edition of that dictionary is available for free online, super useful, they have a second edition that's just come out very recently. And of course the Macquarie dictionary is Australia's dictionary as well. And as someone who's often asked about Australian words and whether they really are Australian both of those are invaluable to me."
8,119,Gretchen,I recently quoted you as my source on Australian English because I did an interview with NPR.
8,120,Lauren,I am your Australian?
8,121,Gretchen,"You're my official Australian, my go to Australian."
8,122,Lauren,You're my go to Canadian.
8,123,Gretchen,"Okay, good, we're equal."
8,124,Lauren,"I do sometimes get a bit nostalgic for my printed dictionaries, none of which made the move with me to the UK. They're all languishing in a box for the moment, but there's something really nice about rifling through a dictionary and you kind of stumble upon something that's related to it but not quite what you were looking for. But I do also remember just the pain of learning to search alphabetically as a child, I just have memories of primary school and the minutes that it would take you to look up a word in the dictionary and that's a very specific skill that you had to learn."
8,125,Gretchen,"Yeah you had to be taught that, I remember being taught how to alphabetise and how to go alphabetically by each letter and not all languages alphabetise as easily as English does. Not all languages have alphabets so they don't all alphabetise. So you have memorise radical order if you want to look stuff up in a paper dictionary in Chinese, you have to know what the first radical is in this particular word and if you want to look up a word based on hearing, it's kind of hard to do that if you're using paper dictionaries because you don't know what the radicals are going to be."
8,126,Lauren,"I have never had to look up a sign language print dictionary but I believe that they, at least some of the ones that I know of, worked on the English kind of gloss or translation words that was the basis of the equivalent for the sign, so you had to know English to be able to look up an Australian Sign Language sign."
8,127,Gretchen,Which is not great if your first language is actually Auslan or ASL.
8,128,Lauren,"But also that's how modern -- so I've only ever looked up online sign dictionaries and Auslan has an amazing one which is the Auslan Sign Bank, there's also a British Sign Language one and I think they're building one for American Sign Language at the moment, I'll put the links to those in the show notes."
8,129,Gretchen,But one of the great things that has happened with sign language dictionaries in the online space is they can have videos and gifs and pictures.
8,130,Lauren,It's so good!
8,131,Gretchen,Rather than just line diagrams of how to make this sign or descriptions of it.
8,132,Lauren,Yep you're trying to follow a static image and you like 'does that arrow mean that the whole hand moves or just the arm?' so the videos are a real boon for sign dictionaries.
8,133,Gretchen,"And multimedia in general, because Kory Stamper has this blog post which I think is going to be related to the topic of her next book about how dictionaries go about defining colour terms, which if you need to do it in kind of black-and-white dictionary in text and, say, like, this is what this shade of red is, you know that's actually quite hard. We have a whole colour episode you can go listen to about defining colours."
8,134,Lauren,"And I think that's also something that's important to mention is that the way words work in dictionaries is not necessarily how they work in your brain. I mean, dictionaries have an important function and we use them to come to an understanding of the meaning of words, but it's not necessary there's a one-to-one equivalence between a dictionary and your brain - thankfully, because I could not sit here rifling through my brain in alphabetical order, it would take me five minutes to say any word."
8,135,Gretchen,"Your brain probably doesn't have an alphabetical order, the alphabet is an arbitrary order order that's just historical."
8,136,Lauren,"My brain probably doesn't, it possibly has some amount of cognitive organisation that now occurs alphabetically because of the way English was imposed in my education system, but definitely not as a kind of primary structure in the way it is in a dictionary."
8,137,Gretchen,"Yeah one of the analogies I like to use is that language is open source, and dictionaries are a form of help documentation."
8,138,Lauren,Ahhh that's nice.
8,139,Gretchen,"And so if you think about an open source project, you have different people contributing to it and stuff lives or dies based on whether other people take it up. So every speaker of a language is contributing to that language's open source project, and it's useful to have help documentation, but help documentation often lags behind new features, you know, like it still says that this menu is over here but actually that's not true anymore because in version 7...."
8,140,Lauren,We changed things --
8,141,Gretchen,"We consolidated the menus. Dictionaries are help documentation for a language, they're not the language itself. The speakers of Yolmo, even though their dictionary is not as complete as the many dictionaries that speakers of English have, they still talk."
8,142,Lauren,They still have all the words and they can add more words.
8,143,Gretchen,"Yeah they still have more words than that, their language is still as complex as English even if their dictionary technology - their help documentation - isn't as as comprehensive.

8,146,Lauren,Lingthusiasm is created and produced by Gretchen McCulloch and Lauren Gawne. Our producer is Claire and our music is by The Triangles.
8,147,Gretchen,Stay Lingthusiastic! [Music]
9,1,Lauren,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics. I'm Lauren Gawne."
9,2,Gretchen,"and I'm Gretchen McCulloch and today we're talking about how small pieces of language combine into larger pieces, AKA constituency. But first Lauren, what have you been up to lately?"
9,3,Lauren,"I have been moving jobs which also involves moving countries, so it's been a pretty busy month!"
9,4,Gretchen,It literally involves moving around the world.
9,5,Lauren,"Yes, so I have been migrating slowly westward for the last few years, working in Singapore and more recently in London and after two fabulous years of living in London we are now on the move back to Melbourne, Australia. I will be a David Myers Research Fellow at Latrobe University for the next three years, which I'm really excited about. It's an opportunity to bring together all of the different languages of Nepal and the Tibetan work that I've been doing across phonetics and across grammar and across gesture, all into one big project."
9,6,Gretchen,That's really cool!
9,7,Lauren,"I'm really excited about that, really excited to be back in Melbourne and lots of exciting research planned. What about you, what have you been up to?"
9,8,Gretchen,"I've been doing a lot of writing on the book (what else is new?) and I'm headed to the LSA Summer Institute, AKA 'Lingstitute', where I'm going to be teaching a class on linguistics outreach, so that's exciting, and, in less momentous but still very important news, I was recently in an NPR article about the linguistics of 'doggo'."
9,9,Lauren,I just love it when internet language memes make it into the new cycle and a whole new audience who've never experienced the meme get it translated for them.
9,10,Gretchen,"Yeah, and they're like 'wow this is so cool but also what is this?' If you haven't encountered the doggo meme it's based around a couple of Facebook groups and a Twitter account and it's just a general zeitgeist about a slightly different cute way of talking to and about your dogs. And I had a lot of fun with the reporter, we actually talked for like an hour and a half, so we'll link to the article in the show notes. But there's even more of that story that didn't make it in and so we've actually made a Patreon bonus this month which is a further deep-dive into the linguistics of doggo, even more historical origins, even more context, Lauren is contributing Australia."
9,11,Lauren,"Even more Australian intuitions about where doggo might come from, so that's on our Patreon."
9,12,Gretchen,"It is thanks to Lauren that I was able to identify the word 'doggo' as probably coming from Australia, so thanks Lauren."
9,13,Lauren,Everyone should have an Australian on their consultant list.
9,14,Gretchen,I think so.
9,15,Lauren,"We also have previous Patreon bonus episodes which include how to teach yourself even more linguistics, which also includes our top recommendations for books videos and further resources for self-study, and also how to sell your awesome linguistic skills to employers so if you are thinking of doing a linguistics degree, you're currently doing one and thinking about your next job or you're looking for a career change, that has got you covered."
9,16,Gretchen,"All sides of the linguistic spectrum! and if you have ideas of things you'd like to hear from us on the podcast or on the bonus episodes you can also do that at Patreon. And speaking of this we reached our sustainability goal on Patreon last month, which means that we officially have the funds to keep paying our producer and our transcriber, who are often the same person, and our audio hosting fees, which is not the same person. And I thiiiink by the time we record the next month's episode, we may have reached our next goal, based on current trends, which is Operation Get Gretchen A Better Microphone."
9,17,Lauren,"I am so excited about this goal, this is definitely one of those ones where our Patreon supporters help everybody win."
9,18,Gretchen,"Yeah everybody wins, you all get to hear me on a better microphone, I win, I'm tired of this too, so this might be the last episode where I sound kind of scratchy, hopefully!"
9,19,Lauren,"So that is www.patreon.com/lingthusiasm, or you can find the link at lingthusiasm.com, oh gosh please, yes please, help Gretchen get a better mic."
9,20,Gretchen,Stay tuned to the next episode where you find out if this was successful.
9,21,Lauren,It's going to be a great reveal as soon as you say a single line.
9,22,Gretchen,"Yeah, I think I do the intro next time too! [Music]"
9,23,Lauren,"Constituency is the fancy way of saying that stuff is made up of other stuff, and so that's how fancy word for this very basic fact that is the main force of today's episode."
9,24,Gretchen,"So far on the podcast we've been approaching language from two ends, we've had this tiny granular end - we've talked about sounds, like the IPA episode, and we're definitely not stopping talking about sounds. And we've talked about words a lot, we're definitely not stopping talking about words either. And we've also been approaching language from the big macro society end, talking about language and world peace, or kids' role in language change, but we haven't talked about the part in between, about how the little bits become a capital L 'Language'. How does that transition happen? And this is a bigger question for one episode, but we're going to start with that."
9,25,Lauren,"And so I think it's important, even though we talk about sound a lot and we talk about words a lot, but languages aren't just lists of words, so you need something more than words here."
9,26,Gretchen,Okay I think languages can be a list of words because have you ever seen those movie cuts where they put all of the words in alphabetical order?
9,27,Lauren,"For the organisers among you this is the most excellent use of somebody's time, it's so good."
9,28,Gretchen,This is like those deconstructed salads where they line up all the tomatoes and the pieces of radish in pretty patterns rather than in a tossed salad.
9,29,Lauren,But in this in this case it's alphabetical patterns.
9,30,Gretchen,"it's alphabetical patterns. So there's 'Of Oz the Wizard', which was some guy who put all of the words in The Wizard of Oz in order, so it starts out with 'a' and then gradually works its way down to 'wizard, wizard, wizard."
9,31,Lauren,"And there's also a Star Wars recut which I find is very meditative, when you've listened to the word Alderaan 20 times and you're just in the zone."
9,32,Gretchen,"We will link to those if you have somehow missed them or if you just want to experience them again. But like, if all of your movies just had all their words in alphabetical order, I don't think that would be a very good movie watching experience. It'd be an interesting avant-guard movie experience once to watch a movie that was like deliberately in alphabetical order."
9,33,Lauren,"Yeah, you'd hope it's a short story for the sake of someone's linguistic ingenuity."
9,34,Gretchen,"Yeah, I'd watch a short film, maximum 20 minutes, someone please make that. So language not just about the words next door, so you can't just look at one word and what is immediately next to it, this structure and the constituency is happening across bigger relationships and groups of words. There's units of words that aren't always obvious from what's next door, and my favourite example of this, the best example, is the phrase 'time flies like an arrow', which with the corollary 'fruit flies like a banana'."
9,35,Lauren,It's still just... it's just so perfect.
9,36,Gretchen,It's so beautiful.
9,37,Lauren,"I know we have this problem sometimes with linguistics where if you've done one Intro to Linguistics course you've done a few, because everyone uses the same anecdote, but there's just something so perfectly constructed about this structural ambiguity."
9,38,Gretchen,"Yeah, so if you've somehow missed the ambiguity or if you just want to hear it explained to you, 'time flies like an arrow' refers to time which is a thing that flies like an arrow flies, whereas 'fruit flies like a banana' does not mean that apples and oranges and pears all soar across the room in the same way that a banana soars across the room, which maybe they do, but it refers to fruit flies which are kind of flies who are fond of bananas."
9,39,Lauren,"In the first sentence, 'time' is the thing that is doing something, whereas in the second sentence, 'fruit flies' are the thing that is doing something, so the sentences are being cut up in different ways and that gives them their different readings."
9,40,Gretchen,"Or to use the terminology that we're introducing in this episode, 'time' is constituent by itself, well, all words are constituents by themselves which is not terribly interesting, but 'time flies' is not a constituent by itself, the 'flies' part goes with the 'like an arrow part'. Whereas in the second sentence 'fruit flies' is constituent by itself and then the 'like a banana' part is also another type of constituent. So how you group the words even when 'flies' and 'like' are the same in both sentences, how you group them is what's changing the meaning there. There's another example of structural ambiguity which is from the BBC radio drama 'Cabin Pressure', which is hilarious and you should all listen to it, but in one case one of the characters says 'Oh, I know what's going on, I went on a course on understanding people in Ipswich' and the other character says 'Well, if I ever want the people of Ipswich understood, I'll let you know.'"
9,41,Lauren,"I actually had the 'understanding people in Ipswich' as one constituent in my head when I first read that, I wasn't reading it very carefully, on your blog post which you had about it which we'll link to, and I was like 'why would you need to? Is it a dialect thing that people in Ipswich have?' so I completely fell for that reading."
9,42,Gretchen,"Yeah, you completely got the wrong interpretation, so obviously there are generic courses of understanding people and some of them, one assumes, happen in Ipswich, but in this case the character is deliberately misinterpreting the other one saying 'Well yeah, that's fine for the people of Ipswich, but what about the person in front of us right now who's not from Ipswich?'"
9,43,Lauren,"A couple of years ago, you had the LingVids video series and you did a little bit of demonstrating how these constituents can move around and be analyzed in relation to each other."
9,44,Gretchen,"We did a series of a videos before I decided to become an audio person rather than a video person, and one of the questions that we asked for the purpose of the video is 'is a sentence more like a bracelet or like a mobile?' So you can think of a couple analogies for how a sentence works.In a bracelet analogy, you think, 'okay, if the words in the sentence are kind of like beads on a string, the way we see a sentence written on a page and it's just flat, and there the one word and the beads can only really notice or are influenced by the beads directly next to them because that's all that's there that's touching them, there's just one string that runs through the whole thing.' Whereas if you make a mobile, like a hanging mobile from a ceiling, then you have stuff hanging off of stuff and then some of the bits that hang off has other things hanging on from them and so there's dependencies and there's relationships between some of the parts of the tree or some of the parts of the structure that are groups. So if you have something like a course on understanding people in Ipswich, is it a course on understanding people and the whole course is in Ipswich, so 'in Ipswich' and 'course on understanding people' both hang off the two parts at the top of a mobile, or is it 'a course on understanding people in Ipswich' in which case 'people' and 'in Ipswich' are hanging off the same bit and 'the course on understanding people' is all the way at the top, so there's ways of thinking of how to group things. So that's the video that you can watch, it's a little bit easier. You can't see me but I'm gesturing!"
9,45,Lauren,"There's ways of thinking about things but conveniently in videos there are also ways of seeing things to go with that explanation, so that's on the Lingvid videos."
9,46,Gretchen,"And we'll link to that too. And the fancy words that linguists give this particular type of constituency where there's more than one different meaning is structural ambiguity, but we're going to we're going to stick with introducing one new term at a time so you don't have to remember structural ambiguity if you want to."
9,47,Lauren,And you've talked about some metaphors like bracelets or mobiles for how constituents can relate to each other.
9,48,Gretchen,"Some people also use the idea of nesting dolls inside each other for constituents, or bowls that get bigger and bigger and nest in each other. A problem that I have with that is that it's hard to account for several things happening at once. It's very linear, there's only one set of layers as you go out and that's not what generally happens with sentences, there's generally more than one kind of set. So I thought of a new-age metaphor which I am very proud to share with you guys. This is a cooking metaphor."
9,49,Lauren,Yes! I'm on board already!
9,50,Gretchen,"So if you're making a cake, you have a set of steps to follow, so you cream the butter and the sugar and then you add the eggs and you add the vanilla. And then you go over to another bowl and you have the flour and you have the baking powder and you have the salt and the cinnamon or something if you want it and you mix those together. And then you add the one bowl to the other bowl and then sometimes you also add pre-prepared ingredients like chocolate chips which also have stuff in them, they have cocoa butter."
9,51,Lauren,"what are they constituted of, hmmm...."
9,52,Gretchen,"And so there's several different kind of subroutines or sub bowls or sub-containers that you need to take care of separately, and each of those has a particular order that you're adding stuff in and then also sometimes you have to go to this other bowl and do stuff. Or when I make cream cheese brownies, which is a recipe that I like a lot, you make the brownie stuff and then you have to make the cream cheese mixture and you add the sugar to the cream cheese and stuff and then you swirl the cream cheese mixture on top, so you have several bowls going on. So it's not just one set of nesting bowls, it's like when you do stuff."
9,53,Lauren,"and exactly the same ingredients you use for your cream cheese brownies, I might use to make chocolate chip cookies."
9,54,Gretchen,With cream cheese icing.
9,55,Lauren,"With cream cheese icing, I don't do that but..."
9,56,Gretchen,I don't know if anyone has but it's all good...
9,57,Lauren,some kind of weird biscuit/ sandwich... I mean it wouldn't be as tasty but it would be still a valid use of the same set of material.
9,58,Gretchen,I think we need to determine this empirically and have a bake-off.
9,59,Lauren,"Okay, I have not made that recipe before so I feel that I'm at something of a disadvantage. All novel baked goods, all novel utterances. So in the same way that I can use exactly the same ingredients to make banana pancakes or banana muffins, but the order in which you pull them together creates something different--"
9,60,Gretchen,"What you put in first and what you mix separately makes a difference. Or something like a sauce, like you make the salad and then you make the salad dressing, and you mix the salad dressing in its own bowl and then you can pour it over the salad as one thing, that's different from making a salad where you throw the salad dressing in with all the other ingredients all separately. And so what that's getting at is if you have 'time flies like an arrow' you can just kind of add each word - 'time' gets added to 'flies like an arrow', 'flies' gets added to 'flies... like an arrow', 'like' gets added to 'an arrow'. But if you have something like 'fruit flies like a banana' you've got to combine 'fruit' and 'flies' together first."
9,61,Lauren,I have a bowl of fruit flies here Gretchen!
9,62,Gretchen,"This is my baking, I'm really good at baking!"
9,63,Lauren,mmm protein...
9,64,Gretchen,"So if you have fruit flies (or raisins or something?) that you want to put in your bananas, you have to combine fruit and flies together as words before you can add that whole thing to 'like a banana'."
9,65,Lauren,I just want to suggest for a moment that maybe some of the more attentive listeners are wondering if we're not just talking about something that they think of as grammar.
9,66,Gretchen,"I think grammar is often used imprecisely, and so constituency is a specific thing within the idea of grammar, so yeah this is this is partially grammar but it's useful to divide that up into specific ideas."
9,67,Lauren,"Yep, so this is one particular part of putting together words to create meanings."
9,68,Gretchen,I thought you were going to say 'I think some of our more astute listeners are you wondering if we're not talking about politics?' because constituency is also a thing in politics.
9,69,Lauren,Sorry for anyone who found this thinking it was a politics podcast.
9,70,Gretchen,"Not a politics podcast. So electoral districts are also constituencies, and a constituent is a person who lives in an electoral district. And they come from the same metaphor, they're related to the word 'constitute', so a person who is a constituent decides who constitutes their Parliament or their Congress or their set of representatives in politics. So they're related but they're not the same thing."
9,71,Lauren,"We've been talking about this as though it just objectively exists, but how do we know constituency exists other than you talking about bowls and other metaphors?"
9,72,Gretchen,"Especially if you can't create one of these ambiguities that prove very nicely that something is going on -- obviously not all sentences are ambiguous, and so how do you do this? The cool thing is that there are totally ways to do this, there is totes science guys!"
9,73,Lauren,This is us getting our linguist lab coats on.
9,74,Gretchen,"So, you know how in chemistry you can add drops of a known chemical to a mystery liquid and see if it turns green or something - I don't know very much about chemistry, this is what all the scientists do in the movies."
9,75,Lauren,These are definitely not chemistry lab coats people.
9,76,Gretchen,"And it'll tell you like if it turns purple it'll tell you whether it's an acid or a base or something like this. So there is stuff you can add to sentences that's known quantities that behaves in certain ways around constituents and then see what happens, and see whether a particular piece of a new sentence is a constituent or not."
9,77,Lauren,So we don't have something like a Large Hadron Collider to show you around.
9,78,Gretchen,Large Hadron Constituencer!
9,79,Lauren,"Yep, unfortunately we haven't built one of those to smash words and phrases into each other, but that's why linguistics is really cool, because you don't even need the imaginary lab coats that we're wearing right now, you just need some linguistic intuitions and you can do the science."
9,80,Gretchen,"You can do science right there in your ears, in your mouth, in your talking."
9,81,Lauren,In the privacy of your own mouth!
9,82,Gretchen,"In the privacy of your own home, you too can do the science, you don't need test tubes or safety goggles."
9,83,Lauren,Try this at home!
9,84,Gretchen,"Do try this at home, it's okay, it won't break anything."
9,85,Lauren,Other than some rules of constituency.
9,86,Gretchen,No constituents were harmed in the making of this experiment.
9,87,Lauren,"So there are a whole range of constituency tests that linguists use to figure out whether something as a constituent or not and these are often language dependent. Some of them you can use in a lot of languages, others are really specific to a particular language. And there are some good videos and actually the Wikipedia summary for this is pretty good as a starting point, so we're not going to go through all of the main tests for English constituency testing, but we are going to share a couple to give you an idea of how it works."
9,88,Gretchen,"Yeah and we will link to more lists so if you think 'I want to test this' you know where to go. The core idea of a constituency test is you want to say 'I've got a sentence and I've got a couple words in this sentence' - so any individual word is going to be a constituent because you could say it by itself if you want so that's not very interesting - but if you've got two words or three words or five words, a string of words in the sentence and you want to say 'are these words functioning together as a unit or is there some break between them?'. And the whole sentence is also going to be a constituent but within a sentence you're going to have some groups of words that are more influenced by each other and some that aren't. And so what we're doing is saying 'okay here's a group of words that we're wondering about. Let's put it through a bunch of other contexts where we know that things that are units do act together and if this one does that too then it is a constituent, and if it doesn't do that too then it's not."
9,89,Lauren,So we need a test subject.
9,90,Gretchen,"I think we should use 'time flies like an arrow, fruit flies like a banana."
9,91,Lauren,Okay that is a very excellent set of guinea pigs to bring into the lab space.
9,92,Gretchen,"Because this will give us some contrast. We've kind of spoiled it for you already, but we want to find out if 'time flies' is a constituent, and we will also want to see if 'fruit flies' is a constituent."
9,93,Lauren,"So, the first test that we are going to subject them to is the questions test, which is more or less using questions to see if they can stand alone, because often if you ask someone a question they just answer with a stand alone response, so if you say to someone 'what did you do last night?' they don't say 'last night I went to the cinema' they just say 'I went to the cinema."
9,94,Gretchen,"You can answer with a fragment and those fragments are all constituents. So if we say 'what likes a banana?' we can answer that with 'fruit flies', but if we say 'what likes an arrow?', we don't want to answer that 'time flies', or like we could but it would be something very very different. And so this is telling us that 'fruit flies' is a constituent, you can use it as an answer to a question and 'time flies' is not a constituent. But if we say 'what flies like an arrow?' we can just answer that 'time' and that's totally fine. So sometime you need to think creatively about what that question needs to be."
9,95,Lauren,"Yeah, where as what 'what flies like a banana?' is literally only a banana. Another test that we could subject them to is the test of substitution."
9,96,Gretchen,"So this means because we know that any individual word is a constituent, if you can find an individual word that you can substitute for a longer string of words that you're wondering about, then that means that this longer string of words has to also be constituent, as long as the sentence keeps doing the same thing."
9,97,Lauren,"So for example you could say 'I like cake' or you could say 'the very beautiful, intelligent woman who has just finished her job in London and is moving back to Melbourne to do a new job likes cake'. Although the second one is very, very long it fills basically exactly the same role in the sentence as the one letter pronoun 'I' and in this case just semantically happens to be the same person!"
9,98,Gretchen,"Happens to be true! yeah so often people use pronouns for this, you can substitute the entire thing with a pronoun. So if we take our 'time flies' example if we say 'time flies like an arrow' you could also say 'it flies like an arrow' but if we want to say 'is 'time flies' a constituent?' then you have to say 'it likes a banana' or 'they like a banana."
9,99,Lauren,'they like an arrow?'. We've got cross contamination on the sentences.
9,100,Gretchen,"So hard to do orally! Yeah the arrow, and if that's supposed to mean the same thing that 'time flies like a' we're dealing with little flapping Timelords, we're not dealing with time flying. Where as for 'fruit flies like a banana' if you have 'it flies like a banana', again you've created a very different sentence where you're talking about something that is thrown across the room, whereas 'they like a banana' is a reasonable and cogent substitute for 'fruit flies like a banana.'"
9,101,Lauren,"There is also another thing that is not part of the standard canon of constituency tests, but I like it as a way of showing that anyone who uses the internet know instinctively what a constituent is, and that's because when we use hyperlinks and clickable links on the internet we rarely break constituent boundaries with those, we usually have a single constituent or a phrase within a single hyperlink."
9,102,Gretchen,"So this is like the anchor text for a hyperlink, so when you you highlight a couple words and then you make them into a link: the words that you highlighted are probably a constituent, you're probably already doing this subconsciously."
9,103,Lauren,"So you would say, if you were writing about 'time flies like an arrow' you might have a hyperlink for 'time' and that would take you to a dictionary definition of time and you might have 'flies like an arrow' might be a hyperlink to a video that shows an arrows flying. Whereas if you have the other sentence you might have seen like 'fruit flies' and that takes you to the Wikipedia page for fruit flies and you might have 'like a banana' and then you have a list of animals that eat fruit."
9,104,Gretchen,"but you'd be unlikely probably to make 'time flies' the anchor text of your hyperlink, unless you're talking about Timelord flies, which in which case it would be a constituent."
9,105,Lauren,"Yeah and it would be very, very unlikely to get something like 'time flies like'."
9,106,Gretchen,"Oh yeah that'd be really weird. But it's surprisingly common, next time you're reading an article that has links in it, check them out to see if they're constituents, there's a fun thing to do. My favourite example of people doing subconscious constituents takes us back to doggo."
9,107,Lauren,Yes!
9,108,Gretchen,This is the best thing.
9,109,Lauren,I'm already there.
9,110,Gretchen,"One of the people behind the doggo thing is a Twitter account called @dog_rates, dog underscore rates, by a guy named Matt Nelson, a lot of people have seen it has like two million followers so you've probably seen this account. This account says things like 'what a cute pupper 10/10 would would pet' and it's great, but the same guy also started a second, more experimental Twitter account, and it's called @dog_feelings, and this is an account where the dog just says stuff in a spaced out doggy sort of voice. And it's more interesting linguistically, to my mind at the moment when we're talking about constituency, because what this dog character does on this Twitter account, which we're definitely going to link to you should definitely go check out because it's really funny, the seed of the account is words in all lowercase and he'll put periods between every couple words - sometimes after a single word, sometimes after two or three words, sometimes he'll even go up to like four and so he'll put periods between them periodically, kind of in the rhythm of a wagging tail or like you know dogs aren't super smart linguistically, so they'll kind of pause a lot and what's really interesting to me is that the pauses often obey constituency boundaries. I'm sure this guy knows no linguistics, I don't think he's doing it consciously."
9,111,Lauren,"But even intuitively it's falling into constituency. I mean, I can read a couple of examples but it does take us into the always-difficult territory of how written memes sound out loud."
9,112,Gretchen,I think we should read an example or two
9,113,Lauren,"Okay, I'll do my best thoughts of dogs voice 'my human. is sad again. I can tell. because. he only gave me. one pat. when I. put my head. in his lap'"
9,114,Gretchen,"What's cool about this is all of these pauses are constituents, so 'my human', that's a constituent, 'is sad again' is a constituent, where as if instead it had been 'my human is. sad again' then that wouldn't have been a constituent. So speaking of pauses, Lauren you do prosody."
9,115,Lauren,I don't do prosody but I really like it. I mean I *do* prosody as in I modulate the way that I speak using intonation.
9,116,Gretchen,"I don't, I talk like a robot."
9,117,Lauren,"Yeah, I have to put your intonation in post hoc in the editing phase. So. Intonation contours, we don't often think about what they contribute but when it comes to spoken language they are often the thing that is doing the heavy lifting in disambiguating sentences so things like 'time flies like an arrow, and fruit flies like a banana', the intonation there helps people. It's not as useful as some other examples."
9,118,Gretchen,Whereas if you just say 'time.. flies.. like.. an.. arrow..' it's harder to tell what you mean by it.
9,119,Lauren,"Yep, and so prosody can often give us some clues as to what's happening in terms of how the constituents are grouped, and that helps disambiguate things. My favourite meme example is a picture of some arctic ice and some glow sticks and small fluffy things, with the line down the bottom 'stop clubbing baby seals', which when you say it that way entirely deserves dancing."
9,120,Gretchen,"Baby seals, what are you doing partying so late, you've got to get up tomorrow!"
9,121,Lauren,awwww you're only babies!
9,122,Gretchen,"you're only babies, are you even allowed to drink yet?!"
9,123,Lauren,Which has an obviously very different reading to 'stop clubbing baby seals.'
9,124,Gretchen,"Yeah, as in stop hitting them with clubs"
9,125,Lauren,"And so it's prosody, and it's the absence of prosody in the photo meme that is creating the joke."
9,126,Gretchen,"And these memes often come around with captions like 'this is the importance of commas,' but commas are just an imperfect representation of prosody. I think a lot of these ambiguity examples work better in writing, precisely because we're so good at prosody, like how you didn't get the people in Ipswich example even though it was totally clear to me listening to the audio of it."
9,127,Lauren,"You would have to be deliberately trying very hard to mishear 'I did a course on understanding people... in Ipswich'. So prosody is doing all the heavy lifting there and it's completely underrated, so just giving a shout-out to my mate prosody."
9,128,Gretchen,"Yeah, it's not necessarily terribly good as a constituency test because commas are weird and generally linguists don't like to use written stuff as a test, but if you can think of 'where could you put commas in this sentence and have the meanings still be preserved?' those are going to be constituency boundaries. It's not necessary going to be all of them, but it's going to be some of them, because that's one of the things that pauses indicators is where there are some breaks between stuff."
9,129,Lauren,"We've been talking about things like intonation and what words are, entirely with English example sentences, that is because that is the language that is the medium of this podcast, but as always, because we like talking about all of the world's languages, we want to stress that these certain types of tests can be done, all languages break down structures to some degree in this way."
9,130,Gretchen,"Yeah all languages have constituents, they have stuff that is more closely associated than other stuff, which tests you can use to show that differs depending on the language and what exactly they use to create those relationships. So in some cases you can do constituency with parts of a single word, not just with groups of words as a whole. So there's some examples of that in English, one example that is very clear is 'undoable'. So 'undoable' can mean two things, one thing it can mean is it's 'un' 'doable', it's not able to be done, and then the other thing it can mean is it's 'undo' 'able' which is it's able to be undone."
9,131,Lauren,"As in, you can Control-Z this."
9,132,Gretchen,"You can Control-Z this, there's an eraser here, whereas this is just impossible it's 'un...doable'. And you can get more elaborate types of constituency with with things on a word as well as between words. So one example that I have for this comes from my misspent Latin education, which was not misspent at all I loved it, and this is a thing that Latin poems would do which is they would really mess around with a word order. In English the word order is very important, but Latin poems especially would often do something different. So let's say you have the phrase 'from a long river', you'd have 'the river' in one line of the poem and ' the long' in another line of the poem and you had to realise that they were actually being associated with each other, and it wasn't just like there's 'from a river' and there's 'from a long something', you had to realise that they were a constituent together, they were actually trying to talk to each other and the poet had just moved them around to get a better rhythm. And the way that you do this in Latin is the endings would have to match. So the word for river in Latin is 'fluvius', which the form of it when it's a subject, and then you have 'longus' which would be the form of the adjective when it's a subject matching the masculine 'us' ending of fluvius. But if you have 'from a long river' that's an ablative, so now you have 'fluvio longo', and even if 'longo' is in line one and 'fluvio' is in line three, you can still be like 'oh they're both in the masculine ablative singular maybe they're actually supposed to be together, maybe they're actually constituent'. So in English constituents tend to be right next to each other but in other languages you can really move them around, when you have something else that tells you 'oh these are things that you're supposed to be interpreting together."
9,133,Lauren,So that's how you kind of first encountered the idea of constituency?
9,134,Gretchen,"Yeah, I was decoding poems in high school thinking 'oh these two things associate' and then when I got to constituency later in linguistics classes I was like 'oh this is the same thing'. How did you first encounter constituency?"
9,135,Lauren,"Before thinking about it in terms of linguistics, I think my first realisation that different words and sets of words could all feel the same kind of grammatical spot and be one constituent was essentially playing a version of mad libs."
9,136,Gretchen,Oh yeah okay
9,137,Lauren,"So if they wanted something that was a noun you could just write 'butt' or you could write 'my brother's big fat smelly butt' and either way it would work, and be hilarious."
9,138,Gretchen,Yeah very hilarious when you're like seven.
9,139,Lauren,"So that is where, it was trying to be funny in mad libs that taught me to think about just how much you could cram in while still actually being the same type of constituent."
9,140,Gretchen,"This gets us back to the grammatical gender point which we talked about in episode two about pronouns, why do languages even bother with having gender, well sometimes it can help you figure out what's a constituent because if you have adjectives that have to agree with gender. Particularly when you have a language like Latin, or Old English would do this too where you could move words around like this, the gender endings could help you find the rest. It's a little like one of those like GPS microchips you put in your dog, like 'we've tagged you, you belong with us here.'"
9,141,Lauren,"I think that there is also a larger theoretical importance to why we should care about constituents and that goes back to the thing we we're talking about earlier, language isn't just made up of individual words, you can't just take all the words from a film and remix them."
9,142,Gretchen,"Yeah, and humans don't just learn how to make sentences by memorising all of the possible sentences. Like 'time flies like an arrow, fruit flies like banana', someone came up with that and you understood it even the first time you heard it, because you knew what the words meant and you knew how to interpret the constituent relationships between those words. It's a thing that languages have where you can make up, right now, a sentence that no one's ever heard before because you know about the relationships between them"
9,143,Lauren,"It fills in, as we said, that kind of middle spot between just individual words or sounds and this larger, full discourse conversation"
9,144,Gretchen,"There's other things that fill it in, we can talk about semantics at some point, but yes figuring out what language is in the human mind since we don't just say individual words it's partly figuring out what kinds of constituency relationships do we have. I think there's also a practical importance to it, so one of the exercises that Intro to Linguistics students typically get set is you need to do a bunch of constituency tests and then you need to draw trees. But the trees themselves are are are only a means to an end, they're not an end in themselves, they're just a representation of all the constituency information you can extract from this sentence in a very convenient and visual form. Then when you start looking at them then you can say 'oh okay well here's how these two sentences actually have the same structure because their trees look identical.'"
9,145,Lauren,"And when you draw syntactic trees it's one way to very quickly see that sentences that look the same on the surface have different structures. So 'fruit flies like a banana' the 'fruit' and the 'flies' are together as a constituent, and they're in a separate node in the tree, whereas 'time flies like an arrow', 'time' is all alone, lonely time in its lonely node, and so you very quickly see that even though they appear the same their structures are different."
9,146,Gretchen,"Yeah so it's a convenient way of visualising that information and conveying it, but a lot of people got very buried in the 'oh I need to figure out what are these constituents and what's going on here' and it can be hard, the first ten or twenty or thirty trees that you draw, every single combination of words you have to run through a bunch of constituency tests, but it's kind of like learning how to navigate or learning how to make a map of the terrain, thinking about what kinds of things have relationships and getting good at just spotting them. I don't have to run constituency tests on every sentence I see now to see whether something's a constituent because most of the common types of ones I can just spot them. And occasionally I get something confusing like 'oh is that a constituent?' I have the tests available, but most of the time I don't need them, just because it's a practice type thing you do when you're beginning to flex your linguistic muscles."
9,147,Lauren,"And I think sometimes people just think that syntactic tree drawing is some academic exercise that we just make our students do so that they suffer, or if they are the subset of people who go on and study syntax, who immediately fall in love with it and draw a tree for everything."
9,148,Gretchen,Or it's kind of like a meaningless intellectual exercise like 'oh I can do sudoku I can draw a syntax tree it's great it's fun but where do you go from there?'
9,149,Lauren,"But they do have really important implications, especially in the field of computer language and how computers interact with language. So for example Google Translate, just like in your films Google doesn't just go word by word and translate each individual word when you put a sentence into their translation portal, instead what happens is it starts thinking in terms of constituents and in terms of larger phrases and it tries to match those up within its corpus, and similarly with their search engines you may type in a whole sentence but it knows how to extract the constituents that are relevant for searching."
9,150,Gretchen,Yeah anything that's trying to do it like a natural language interface is trying to figure out okay how do you understand the parts of a natural language thing. So there's practical reasons why constituency is important but also once you get used to constituency you can make lots of fun jokes with structural ambiguity and lots of fun jokes with time flies.

10,2,Lauren,"and I'm Lauren Gawne, and today we'll be talking about how learning a language is a way of giving yourself great linguistic skills. But first, Gretchen, you sound amazing!"
10,3,Gretchen,"Thank you! You're hearing me on this new microphone, actually a recorder, which is thanks to our lovely patrons who have enabled us to buy this microphone. Lauren, how is it that you always sounded so good?"
10,4,Lauren,"It wasn't just sheer, natural magic, it's because I have been using, since the beginning of the podcast, an audio recorder called a Zoom H4N, which -- the H4N Zoom have a slightly newer model as well, but these recorders are kind of linguist-famous for being reliable, solid recorders, especially for doing things like fieldwork, so I've had one for quite a few years to do my linguistic fieldwork with, so if you listen to any of my recordings from Yolmo or Syuba or any of those in the archives that I have, they're made on this very same recorder and so that's why I've always been able to sound good without us needing any budget for that. But now we're twinsies, and you have a Zoom H4N as well."
10,5,Gretchen,So now I have a matching one. They're friends.
10,6,Lauren,Yeah.
10,7,Gretchen,"They haven't met yet, but that's okay, they're going to meet in audio heaven, so that we will sound the same audiowise and so that I can learn how to use it from Lauren and we're going to sound really good, so that's exciting!"
10,8,Lauren,"Yeah, and a big thanks to our patrons for that."
10,9,Gretchen,"Yeah! And it is thanks to people on Patreon that we were able to make this possible and keep doing that, so that is really exciting. Also, they get to listen to bonus episodes and this month's bonus episode is about hypercorrection."
10,10,Lauren,Bonus episodes will also sound amazing because they're all on the shiny new recorder as well.
10,11,Gretchen,Yes!
10,12,Lauren,"As you said, our current one is hypercorrection, but we also have a whole bunch of other bonus content and you can get all of it if you become a monthly supporter of the show."
10,13,Gretchen,"On patreon.com/lingthusiasm or follow the links from our website/social media. And by the time you're listening to this, I will also be in Kentucky at the Linguistics Summer Institute, or Lingstitute as we like to call it, and we are recording this in advance because we're organised like that, but that will be having lots of stuff going on."
10,14,Lauren,'Cause you're going to be a bit busy.
10,15,Gretchen,"Ha, I'm going to be really busy -- that'll have lots of stuff going on on the Lingstitute hashtag, which we can link to, and as well my class at the Institute -- I'm going to be teaching a class on linguistics communication, linguistics outreach, how to be better at explaining linguistics and bringing linguistics to more people -- and so we're going to be using the hashtag LingComm, that's LingComm with two Ms as in communication --"
10,16,Lauren,Awesome.
10,17,Gretchen,-- and so you can follow those as well if you want to follow along with the class and see what we've been up to.
10,18,Lauren,I will definitely be doing that.
10,19,Gretchen,"Lauren is going to be, like, co-teaching the class from afar, she doesn't know it yet, but she's going to be like, 'Hey, go support my students!' [Music]"
10,20,Lauren,"So, Gretchen, you're a linguist. How many languages do you speak?"
10,21,Gretchen,"That's a good question! That is a question that a lot of linguists get, a lot of the time."
10,22,Lauren,"It's a question that a lot of linguists get -- it's a little bit annoying because it misrepresents the idea that linguistics is just about learning lots of languages, but independent of being a linguist, you'll find that people who study how language works are often interested in learning other languages as a way of kind of getting an understanding of how they work."
10,23,Gretchen,"Yeah, and I think for me, because -- at least personally, the way I got into linguistics was in high school, I came across pop linguistics books and stuff like this, and I was like, 'Wow, this is so cool, I want to do this when I get to university.' But I knew that I couldn't do it in high school, there's no high school linguistics course that I could take then -- they're still very rare in high schools -- and so I said to myself, 'Well, I know it's not quite the same as language learning, but I'm going to at least enrol in all of the language classes that I can because I'm sure it won't do any harm. And, you know, I could be learning about cell biology or something, or I could learn more languages and I think the language would be more useful,' and I think they were for me. I mean, cell biology's fine if you're into it, but like..."
10,24,Lauren,So what languages do you have experience of learning?
10,25,Gretchen,"So, I started learning French in grade four when I was in school, because that's the latest age you can learn French in for Canadian schools. It would have been nice to learn it earlier, but that wasn't offered. And then I did a Scottish Gaelic summer camp when I was like 10 or 12 or something? I went to Cape Breton and I spent a week learning Scottish Gaelic. Everyone else was there to learn, like, fiddle and step dancing and stuff and I was like, 'I'm just going to take all the language ones.' I don't remember a whole lot of that, except for the fact that they put the verbs at the beginning of the sentences, which is really neat, and I have a couple songs memorised from that, so that's fun. So I can occasionally sometimes do something with a song. But I didn't really know much about grammar except what I'd learned from French at that point, so I didn't have a lot to hold on to there."
10,26,Lauren,Yep.
10,27,Gretchen,"I also mostly self-studied Latin in grade 10, because again, I was interested in linguistics, and at that point in my mind, linguistics and Classics overlapped a lot, and the history of grammatical descriptions of English is very bound up in Latin. So I was like, clearly, this is the thing I need to do. So I got myself a Latin textbook and worked through all the exercises."
10,28,Lauren,Of course! This is a very good insight into how Gretchen's brain works there.
10,29,Gretchen,And then in grade 11 I convinced my guidance counselor against his better judgment to let me take both Intro Spanish and Intro German and continue my French --
10,30,Lauren,Right.
10,31,Gretchen,"-- because I was like, 'Look, I'm not picking between these.'"
10,32,Lauren,That's a lot of language.
10,33,Gretchen,"That was a really interesting experience, because one day, I remember, in German class we did numbers and then I went to math, and then in Spanish class an hour later we were doing numbers and I was like, 'I can't... handle this...'"
10,34,Lauren,"Right, yeah, challenging."
10,35,Gretchen,But it really taught my brain. I really convinced my brain that there was more than one other language than French.
10,36,Lauren,Yup.
10,37,Gretchen,"'Cause this is a problem a lot of people run into you when you're learning another language is that you're like, 'Okay, I have my native language and then I have, like, every other language' and they just blend into each other too much.'"
10,38,Lauren,"Ah, that is how my brain is organised, definitely."
10,39,Gretchen,"I have to say, if you really want to convince your brain that there are multiple languages, learning them all in parallel is one way to get that. It's not pretty at the time, but it has been very persistent! Yeah, so then in undergrad I was trying to do about one new language a year for about eight years or so. So in undergrad I took Ancient Greek for a year and then I was like, ""I'm doing too many European languages this is ridiculous,' and so then the next year I took Arabic. I took that for two years and then wrote my honours thesis about Arabic."
10,40,Lauren,Yep.
10,41,Gretchen,"And then I did a field methods class on Kinyarwanda, which is a Bantu language spoken in Rwanda. And that was really interesting, but I learned more about that from kind of the linguistic side than from the conversational side."
10,42,Lauren,Yep.
10,43,Gretchen,"I only remember a few words. And then I took Italian just for fun, because I needed to fill an elective."
10,44,Lauren,You needed to fill in your romance paradigm.
10,45,Gretchen,"Yeah, I needed -- I was like, I feel really incomplete in the romance languages! I still have never learned Portuguese and I don't know if it would be a good use of time, but there's a part of me that wants to, just to fill it in. Yeah! And then I got to grad school, and then in grad school I did a field methods class in the first semester on Mi'kmaq, which is an Algonquian language located in Eastern Canada, and then I kept on working with that language and the language teaching classes and stuff for the rest of my degree and for my thesis. So yeah, that was kind of when I stopped learning a new language every year."
10,46,Lauren,Fair enough!
10,47,Gretchen,But I had a really good run of it!
10,48,Lauren,Yeah!
10,49,Gretchen,"And the European languages got easier and easier as I kept learning more of them. The non-European languages were each their own unique challenge, as far as the grammar went."
10,50,Lauren,Right.
10,51,Gretchen,"Yeah, so I have a pretty extensive language learning history and I definitely don't remember all of these, so obviously the question of 'What do you know, what do you speak, what do you learn?' is always one that comes up when you're talking about speaking lots of languages. But I did spend a lot of time in language classes."
10,52,Lauren,"Yeah, fair enough."
10,53,Gretchen,What about you? You speak some languages.
10,54,Lauren,"I kind of lumped my language learning into three different phases of my life. So, the first exposure I had to language learning was in primary school. My primary school taught Italian, but by 'taught Italian' I mean in this very Australian -- Australia is, like, upsettingly proud of its monolingual educational focus, I think, so a lot of schools do some amount of language learning, but there's no real understanding, or nothing imparts to students why you might be learning this or why it might be interesting to care about another culture or a language, and so I learnt lots of random Italian vocabulary and some songs in primary school and at the start of high school. And then when I changed schools halfway through high school, no one felt at all compelled to encourage me to keep going with Italian or to take up one of the languages at that school, and I didn't really understand the idea of learning languages. Everyone in my family day-to-day spoke English, everyone in my social life day-to-day spoke English, and other countries and languages just seemed really far away. So that was kind of my early, underwhelming language exposure. Does mean I can navigate an Italian menu quite well sometimes, but not much more."
10,55,Gretchen,"Yeah, I mean, I guess for me in Canada, the French thing was, 'Well, you should stay in French because it'll help you get a job later.' Because if you want to work in tourism, or if you want to work for the government, it's useful to be able to speak French. So it was very kind of, like, mercenary-focused around learning the language."
10,56,Lauren,"And also being in Canada, like, even if you're in an English-speaking province, you're exposed to this idea that French is a language in the wild, like it's on your groceries when you buy them and it's in the news --"
10,57,Gretchen,Yeah.
10,58,Lauren,-- kind of thing.
10,59,Gretchen,Yeah.
10,60,Lauren,"So then after high school, I went to live in Poland for a year and that was interesting, because my grandmother's Polish and it's her first language and so I was interested in kind of reconnecting with that and also kind of just living somewhere different and doing something different. And that's my period of, like, understanding the motivation for language learning, but it was before I'd done linguistics or really had any good role models for language learning and so I became pretty competent, but I missed out on a lot of things that are kind of considered good practice for becoming a strong second language learner. So I was having some lessons, but I wasn't always good at kind of encouraging myself to speak to people in certain contexts, and so I really enjoyed doing that, but when I got to Australia there weren't many opportunities to continue that. And for some reason I think I was so annoyed about that when I started university that I never took up a language course."
10,61,Gretchen,"I took, like, all the languages, I was like, 'Oh, I can finally take other languages!'"
10,62,Lauren,"I really don't understand what 19-year-old Lauren was thinking, but I'm really thankful that she took linguistics, because obviously I've been pretty enthusiastic about it ever since. And that kind of led to my third era of language learning, which has been kind of understanding, like, post- studying linguistics, understanding my own motivations and practices and behaviours in language learning, and since then I've learnt Nepali, which I use in kind of day-to-day interactions when I'm on fieldwork, and Nepali is great because it's an Indo-Aryan language, so it's part of this larger Indo-European family, so it's not too hard for me to get my head around in terms of the structure, but it does some really cool, nifty things with the grammar. And I've also learnt -- to varying degrees, not as well -- a couple of different Tibetan dialects that I've worked with. I would say my competency there is more what we call passive competency in linguistics. So, I can understand a lot of things that are said to me, I often can't reply that speedily or I end up just falling back on Nepali. And then I've also been learning some Auslan at various points while in Australia, which is the Australian sign language. It's related to British Sign and New Zealand Sign Language, and now that I've moved back to Australia I'm really looking forward to getting back into Auslan. And that's been really great because it's completely unrelated to my study, I just really enjoy it. So that's kind of a whirlwind tour of my --"
10,63,Gretchen,"And it's related to your research in the sense that you do gesture, and so having a better understanding of sign probably helps you with gesture research? I don't know, I'm making this up."
10,64,Lauren,"It helps with my gesture research, but, you know, I think as a linguist I can kind of make the excuse that any language learning is helpful for my job to some degree, but I also just love Auslan and learning a sign language is a really fun change from spoken language to a sign language is quite good for my brain, and it does get less chatted up with all the random bits of Italian and, you know, café French."
10,65,Gretchen,"I never had the opportunity to learn sign language, although I'm sure I could find lessons now. If I was going to learn another language it might be either ASL or LSQ, which is Langue des Signes Québécoise, and I'm not quite sure what the relative linguistic situation there is about, which one is spoken more in Montreal, but yeah. I knew a linguist who could speak Mayan and was learning ASL and was like, 'My brain is trying to do Mayan structures in ASL and it's the weirdest thing.'"
10,66,Lauren,"Oh, that's great, that's so good."
10,67,Gretchen,"Yeah! So, I don't know if that happens everybody, but I guess some people do get that kind of cross-modal transfer. For me, the question of, okay, how many languages do you speak is, I can answer that, but I feel like I'm kind of letting down the team in that case because I don't speak a lot of them terribly well, and I think for me one of the things that changed was when I started learning non-European languages, I mean the grammar was very different, but also the kind of cultural context that you come into learning those is a lot different. So, you know, as an English speaker, learning French, particularly in Canada where they're both official languages and so on, that's very different from being either an English- or French-speaker in Canada learning a Canadian indigenous language where, you know, indigenous languages aren't on the cereal boxes."
10,68,Lauren,Yeah.
10,69,Gretchen,Where they aren't being taught in schools from a very young age the way English and French are.
10,70,Lauren,Yeah.
10,71,Gretchen,So I think becoming more aware of kind of the colonial context in which language learning and denying people the opportunity to learn their language is a bigger issue that I became more aware of.
10,72,Lauren,"I grew up in Australia on Bunurong country and that is a language that is now taught in some primary schools around that area, which makes me so happy and I wish that was a thing that happened when I was a kid. There is a lot of complexity around, you know, language ownership, especially in the Australian context -- who is allowed to learn a language and which parts of a language -- it doesn't operate the same as, say, English or French or Italian where you can hand someone a textbook and they kind of have the right to speak the whole language. So there's an imbalance there, and there's also just -- same in Australia as in Canada -- that historical imbalance of who is expected to learn whose language."
10,73,Gretchen,"Yeah, exactly, and if you say, like, okay, well, my ancestors are the ones that were preventing their ancestors from learning the language in the first place and now I want to come in and I've decided it's cool, like, that's a weird position to be in."
10,74,Lauren,"And there's also a bit of a problem in Australia with heritage languages. So as I mentioned, my grandmother is a native Polish speaker and out of all of my aunts and uncles and my cousins, I'm the only one who speaks or, more likely, spoke that language with her to any kind of degree of competency, because in Australia there's this erasure, often, of people's migrant languages and their linguistic experience. And she was told to never speak Polish, or, she's also a fluent German speaker, and was told to not speak either of those to her own children because it would interfere with their English. And those attitudes are kind of changing..."
10,75,Gretchen,"Yeah, I think it's the same here, though a lot of people, at least -- I'm not sure so much about people who came over in like the '60s -- you get this kind of generation that immigrates, speaks their language, they learn English, and then their kids grow up and they're kind of more or less bilingual, and then the grandkids only really speak the dominant language."
10,76,Lauren,Yeah.
10,77,Gretchen,"Depending on the community, some of them try to retain their heritage language more -- they'll send their kids to Chinese school or Hebrew school or something on the weekends to try to have them retain that connection to their heritage language, and some of them don't have access to those schools, or don't feel the pressure to do that, so it depends on the community, but there's a lot of language loss. And I think that's something else that doesn't come up so much in language classes, is there's this sense when you go into a language class that you walk in and then you're starting with zero knowledge and you're going to have the knowledge, like, spooned into you the way that when you walk into a math class, you don't know any math, or when you walk into a science class you don't know what a cell is and you just have to get that told to you and then you know."
10,78,Lauren,Yeah.
10,79,Gretchen,"Whereas for kids that are coming from a heritage language context, they may know some stuff, and there may also be a lot more guilt about not knowing this stuff, or feeling like you should already know it, which you don't get so much, like, I didn't run into that learning French or something."
10,80,Lauren,"And there's also a kind of prestige thing about learning certain languages as certain communities, and so a lot of English-dominant or English-monolingual parents might see a lot of prestige in sending their child to a bilingual English-French school because French bilingualism has this prestige status, but then we have these children who come in who are amazing bilinguals in, say, Vietnamese and English, or, in Australia we have a lot of indigenous children who are Kriol speakers, so that's a language that has a lot of English words that have created it, but it is its own language, or they speak a variety that's called Aboriginal Australian English. So they speak these varieties and then they come into school and they're in a similar position where they're bilingual or they're trying to become English speakers as well as Kriol speakers. Even though there are, you know, many cognitive benefits that people discuss in relation to multilingualism, there's not the social prestige and there's a lot of issues with getting people to accept that these children need additional support to move towards being full bilinguals and so that kind of thing, when you're kind of just signing up for your undergraduate Spanish class or you're taking Japanese or Arabic or some of the global languages, you can often not be aware that there's a lot of social prestige and a lot of good fortune to just be able to do that."
10,81,Gretchen,"And I think also that our expectations are different when it comes to rolling up to a college-level language class and spending a couple semesters learning Japanese or Spanish or something, like, 'Oh, now I kind of speak this!' And you can -- you know, you passed the test but if you go there you can barely do greetings. Whereas, if you have someone who speaks a different first language at home coming into an English-dominated school environment, that's gonna be a very different situation because they're now going to be expected to function at the same level as these kids that have all of this English at home as well. It's not just like, 'Oh, I can say a few greetings and read menus and signs now and now I speak this language,' it's -- you're not functioning completely 100% like a native English speaker, like you're doing something wrong, and like who we value bilingualism coming from."
10,82,Lauren,"Yeah, and also what the motivation for people to learn a language is. So for a lot of people, to learn English is increasingly considered a kind of economic necessity to move forward in life. Like, when I was in Nepal, for me, learning Nepali was a great way to connect with people, it's a way to allow me to do my job, but no one is forcing me to learn Nepali in my family to improve my economic outlook or allow me to work overseas, whereas a lot of my friends are really struggling to learn English and and feel like they are obliged to learn English to have a more secure economic future and that's, like, it's such a gulf in expectations. And you know, if I didn't speak Nepali I would probably still get by day to day in Nepal because so many people can accommodate my linguistic needs and so many people there speak an amount of English now to get by day to day, and they're massively different motivations."
10,83,Gretchen,"And something else that you run into, I think, in English-speaking areas is that, like, English is a lingua franca, so even people who don't speak the same first language, they all speak English as a second language. And in those contexts, sometimes the native English speakers can be the ones that speak too quickly or use too many idioms or aren't paying attention to doing the comprehension checks that you do if something's your second language, and so you have a kind of global English and you have a kind of too quick English, or too nativised English as well in some of those contexts."
10,84,Lauren,"Yeah, I think -- and this is something you have a post on, about learning second languages -- like, learning other languages has made me far more tolerant and understanding of people who have different levels of English speaking."
10,85,Gretchen,"For me, being able to say, oh, okay, so this person's English is around the level of my French, which makes me able to say -- I'll only say things in English to this person that I could say in French."
10,86,Lauren,Yeah.
10,87,Gretchen,"Or this person's English is around the level of my Spanish. My Spanish is much worse than my French, so now I'll only say things in English that I could say in Spanish."
10,88,Lauren,Yeah.
10,89,Gretchen,"And to be able to kind of put myself in the shoes of what do I find useful if someone's trying to do a comprehension check with me, you know, it's not just a matter of talking louder, but sometimes it's a matter of articulating a little bit more clearly, or a matter of saying something two or three times in the same sort of way. Yeah, figuring out, like, what do I appreciate when someone is doing for me in a second language and how can I do that if I'm talking to someone who's less fluent in English, I think is one thing -- I think another thing that comes up for me with second language speaking is there's a big rupture between the classroom experience of learning a language and the real-life experience of speaking a language that you're less fluent in."
10,90,Lauren,"Oh my gosh, so much."
10,91,Gretchen,"Let's pause it and think about how big that it is, right. Like, there's a lot there. And you can be, like, a straight-A student in your language classroom, or you can get all of the -- check off all of the things on Duolingo or Rosetta Stone or one of those, and tick all the boxes and yet when it comes to speaking, you're like, 'Uhhh...'"
10,92,Lauren,Yeah.
10,93,Gretchen,Or you don't even want to let on that you do speak any of the language because it's so terrifying.
10,94,Lauren,Yeah.
10,95,Gretchen,How have you dealt with this?
10,96,Lauren,"Well, I consider myself pretty articulate in English and I've just kind of had to accept that I'm a different person in Nepali because I just don't have the same linguistic repertoire that I have in my native language, and so in Nepali I'm a very quiet person, I do a lot of listening and I make really bad jokes about my poor language to kind of offset the fact that my language is really poor."
10,97,Gretchen,"Yeah, yeah, you become kind of more willing to laugh at yourself."
10,98,Lauren,Yeah.
10,99,Gretchen,"To compensate. I think for me, yeah, I'm less verbally dexterous in French; I'm pretty fluent in the sense of doing stuff, but it's harder for me to make just kind of idle small talk."
10,100,Lauren,Yup.
10,101,Gretchen,"Like, beyond one or two stock -- I have one or two stock things, but if I'm trying to make casual conversation about something, I don't always have those words, so maybe that's just not a kind of conversation that I'm currently able to have in French."
10,102,Lauren,"So I think the big difference for me between learning Polish and learning Nepali is that I just -- even though my Nepali was atrocious when I first turned up in the country, I made a point, even with people who spoke English, to make our day-to-day social interactions in Nepali. And it was horrific for everyone and it was exhausting for the first little bit, but in a way I've benefited because there were all these relationships that I now have that I had so much more Nepali practice, whereas in Polish, because my language was really poor when I arrived, a lot of my initial relationships and friendships that I set up were in English and that kind of set the tone for those. So I've learnt to use that doggedness about just kind of sticking with it even though I've only got like three sentences' worth of interaction to have, but it is really exhausting. And it's the benefit of being in the country."
10,103,Gretchen,"Yeah, I found this -- so I live in Montreal and when I moved here, I had, my whole life, this cautionary tale that my mom and my uncle had both learned some French in school and then they had tried to improve it when they were around university age, and my mom had gone to some sort of -- to a camp thing where they were only allowed to speak French and they had to sign a contract that said they'd get kicked out if they spoke any English, and --"
10,104,Lauren,A contract!
10,105,Gretchen,"Yeah! This is how you create this social pressure. This is not uncommon in language learning camps, actually, is that you signed yourself up for this contract."
10,106,Lauren,Okay.
10,107,Gretchen,And my uncle instead had gone to Montreal where over half the population is bilingual.
10,108,Lauren,Yeah.
10,109,Gretchen,"And at the end of their respective summers, my mom's French was quite good and my uncle's French had not improved at all, really, because he just spoke English with everybody."
10,110,Lauren,Yeah.
10,111,Gretchen,"Because he didn't have to do it. And so I said to myself, well, I'm moving to Montreal, I'm not going to be like my uncle -- lovely guy, but I'm not going to do this thing. I'm going to decide that the city speaks French to me, that even when people try to switch into English, I don't have to accept that. The analogy I like to use is that somebody trying to switch into English on you is like them trying to pick up the check."
10,112,Lauren,Yeah.
10,113,Gretchen,"It's a very nice thing for them to do, but you don't always want to be in the situation where other people are picking up the check for you."
10,114,Lauren,Yup.
10,115,Gretchen,"And once you realise that you can sometimes pick up the check, it gives you this tremendous feeling of power and altruism to be like, 'I am so magnanimous and I am paying for this now!'"
10,116,Lauren,So smugness is one of your secret language learning powers.
10,117,Gretchen,"Yeah, be more smug to speak better, to learn language better."
10,118,Lauren,"Yeah, fair enough."
10,119,Gretchen,"So, you know ,if you're in a context where -- like a service-type interaction where you're in a store or restaurant or something, and someone says -- in Montreal it's very common to hear 'Bonjour hi,' and what they're trying to do is say, 'Pick a language so I can speak to you in it.'"
10,120,Lauren,"Right, yeah."
10,121,Gretchen,And because it's pretty much impossible to get a job in downtown Montreal if you're not bilingual in English and French.
10,122,Lauren,Okay.
10,123,Gretchen,"And so, saying, okay, like, most people, what they want in that situation is they want to be able to speak their first language. And I know this because I worked at a museum for a couple summers and I was one of the designated bilingual staff members, and when I could find a tourist who was speaking French and I could speak French to them, you could just see this relief wash over them in waves. It was beautiful. And the nice thing about, you know, particularly if I'm going to the grocery store or whatever, is you have lots of microinteractions where it's just a couple sentences. And so even if you end up in English for one of them, you can do French the next time and it's okay."
10,124,Lauren,Yeah.
10,125,Gretchen,"So you have a lot of kind of micro- practice. And so I think, you know, they say that speaking a second language improves your executive functioning, or your --"
10,126,Lauren,Yeah.
10,127,Gretchen,"-- you know, that kind of quick-wittedness and self-control and these kinds of things, and I think one of it is it gives you this practice in being very persistent and putting yourself in situations where you're uncomfortable and working through that, and I think that's one of the places where that benefit is really apparent."
10,128,Lauren,"It's definitely given me this ability to be, like, having a very basic conversation using one half of my brain and the other half of my brain going, 'Okay, what's next? What's next?' Have we got words, have we got words? What are the words? What've we got? What can I talk about next?! Um, um, um...' And I find that knowing that my brain can do those two things and I can look relatively chill while doing that has definitely helped my English public speaking. Like, I know when I lecture now, my brain is kind of doing the same thing and I'm like, well that's okay, it's just running that parallel process and it's fine, and others keep saying sentences in this really like methodical one word after the other kind of way and so, yeah, I think it does -- it helps with that level of executive functioning."
10,129,Gretchen,"I think it's also taught me more about how conversations are structured. And this is something I never got in the language classroom, but how to talk around something that you don't have the word for so that the other person can supply the word for you?"
10,130,Lauren,Yeah.
10,131,Gretchen,"So, like, if I want to buy a zipper or something in Montreal, I don't know the French word for zipper, but I can talk around, like, ""Oh yeah, I need this thing,' and point to one and they'll be like, 'Oh, of course, un zipper,' or whatever it is. And then I'm like, 'Yes, obviously, I clearly knew this word, I just chose not to say it right now until you did, obviously.'"
10,132,Lauren,Yeah.
10,133,Gretchen,"And, you know, being able to use words like 'this thing' or 'that thing' or point to stuff or indefinite types of words, I think we spend a lot of time trying to get vocabulary lists of concrete nouns into people's heads when you can't learn all of the nouns. You need to learn how to learn nouns in context the way speakers do. You know, as a child you don't go memorise a vocabulary list of what all possible things you can put on a pizza are, you just pick them up as people are pointing to them and stuff like that."
10,134,Lauren,"Yeah, definitely. I think also the difference in my language learning now is that I have moved through language and interactions and language a bit more with my linguist brain on, and so becoming more competent in the language involves more than -- like, when I was learning Polish or even Italian as a kid, it was all about learning the words and what order they go in and those kind of early language learning experiences, whereas now I pay a lot more attention to things that happen in social interactions. So how if interrupting someone is an okay thing to do or if people kind of leave a lot of silence. So in a lot of my social interactions in Nepal, people are very happy to leave long silences and I think when I was starting to learn Nepali and a couple of other languages of Nepal, I was always like, 'Okay, okay, what do I say next? What do I say next? There's a silence, I have to say a thing, I have to ask a question, isn't that how it works?' And now I know the social rhythm of interactions allows for a lot more, like, 'I want to sit here for a bit and then one of us can think of a thing to say, that's okay.'"
10,135,Gretchen,Yeah.
10,136,Lauren,"Also politeness. So, like, who to be polite to and who you can be informal with. So for example, in Nepali you have different verb politeness registers for, like, a more honorific one if you're talking to someone who's more senior than you, and a much more informal one for friends, and an even more informal one that is, like, it would be so rude for me to learn it in a Nepali context that I've just never bothered to because that makes that easier. And at the start, learning who to say those things to -- and now, like, I know with some of the younger kids I know I'll occasionally use those more honorific ones if I want to be like, 'Oh, I'm treating you as an adult now,' like, 'You're growing up,' or if I want to bring someone in a bit more conspiratorially, I'll use the informal one -- and so knowing how to navigate those social features of the language, not just conjugating the verbs for those."
10,137,Gretchen,"I think being able to say, like, having more tolerance for yourself on saying, if I'm going to make these mistakes, that's very interesting because this is what it tells us about my language capacity right now. Or I'm interested in what I'm doing, but I'm not as -- there's a sense of okay, well, you should just be able to acquire a language and now it's done and you've got it and you totally speak it, and that's not a thing that you end up at, but where do I have intuitions about this and where do I not have intuitions about this."
10,138,Lauren,"There's a whole field of second language acquisition in linguistics that just looks at how people go about learning their second language and I remember taking that class as an undergraduate and just being really relieved to know things that we know are pretty common facts about language acquisition, like there's often a very rapid acceleration and then a plateau in learning. So moving from being an intermediate competent to an advanced speaker involves a lot more work for visible improvement."
10,139,Gretchen,"Yeah, something that was very interesting for me to learn in second language acquisition classrooms was that we have this sense that, oh, you need to start learning a language as a baby because otherwise you're going to be doomed and you're always going to, you know, it's always going to be hard for you. But there are actually some domains where adults have an advantage or older speakers, older children even, have an advantage. And so children tend to be better at the phonology side, so they're going to learn the sounds, the subtle distinctions, because that's all they're being exposed to and they have that capability. But it takes a long time for kids to learn a significant amount of vocabulary or grammar. Like, if you think about a baby, right, a baby gets exposed to a language. And as many hours in a day as it's awake, for a whole year, generally, before it even says a single word. Like if you gave an adult that kind of exposure, if you had them literally only being exposed to that language and you're like, 'Yeah, we don't really expect me to talk for a whole year,' that's just not what our expectations are when it comes to adults. And the fact that an adult can walk out of an hour-long class and have half a dozen words that they pretty much know, even if they have forgotten half of them by next week, that's still six words that they've learned, and the baby takes like a year and a half to learn that."
10,140,Lauren,"Six words up on the baby! And the other thing is that, like, I'm learning a language around having a full-time job and hobbies, whereas a child is literally doing nothing besides being fed, put to bed, hanging out listening to language, and they don't even have to speak."
10,141,Gretchen,"They're not doing nothing but learning the language! You gotta learn to sit up at some point in there, too, that's pretty difficult."
10,142,Lauren,Yup.
10,143,Gretchen,"But I mean, you've also got to learn a lot of stuff as a baby, like the fact that you have a mouth and that words exist and that language is possible. Like, these are things that adults don't have to learn."
10,144,Lauren,Yeah.
10,145,Gretchen,"And adults have these tremendous advantages -- you don't necessarily want to be doing all of your language learning by writing stuff down because that's one of the ways that people get very dependent on a paper and not very confident about talking -- but as an adult you do have the ability to write stuff down and go study it and, you know, spend an hour of focused practice on a bunch of words and then remember them next week. And the kids don't do that kind of focus practice, already knowing how to read and write in one language makes it easier to learn it again, so there are certain advantages. So adults learn, like, vocabulary and syntax a lot quicker than babies do, even if you end up still having an accent. Also, in addition to that kind of first year where you don't expect kids to be able to do anything, there's also the later period of if you have a three-year-old who's fluent in English or whatever language, you don't expect a three-year-old to be able to do a whole lot. You don't expect them to be able to negotiate business deals or follow complex instructions or, like, write novels. There's a lot you don't expect a three-year-old or a five-year-old or even like an eight- or ten-year-old to be able to do. You don't expect ten-year-olds to know contract law."
10,146,Lauren,Yeah.
10,147,Gretchen,"Whereas if you're an adult and you're learning a language for business purposes, you often want to be able to go directly into a business context or directly into complex social environments, like, we don't expect kids to be particularly good diplomats in a social context where you have to keep secrets and stuff. So our expectations are a lot higher as adults."
10,148,Lauren,"Good work adults, you just have a pat on the back."
10,149,Gretchen,"Yeah, adults: underrated language learners."
10,150,Lauren,Yeah.
10,151,Gretchen,"Even though it's difficult, and spending, like, three or four hours a week on it, which is considered a pretty good amount for a language class, is not very much at all compared to what a kid gets. I think there's a general idea that if you are really serious about being a language learner, you don't just go to class for three hours and figure you'll get it eventually. Like, people do watch movies and listen to books on tape and give themselves a whole bunch of extra exposure and stuff as well, but that's considered like a kind of high-intensity language learning thing."
10,152,Lauren,"And I think it's okay if you get as far as learning how to order a coffee in Italian or you get as far as being able to make small talk with your friends in Swahili. If that's your aim, then that's great. We're not saying that you have to start a language and you have to become completely fluent in it, but knowing what social aspirations you have for the language you're learning and being aware that it's the language that exists in a culture and it has things like its own way of making jokes and being polite and having conversations definitely help you get the most out of your language learning experience."
10,153,Gretchen,"It's also worth pointing out that there are different levels of resources available for language learning, like we're used to the idea that any language is going to have bilingual dictionaries or online resources or TV shows and this kind of thing in that language, and that's not something that exists for all languages either. So, you know, which languages you even can learn is something that also comes up."
10,154,Lauren,It comes back to that economic access and prestige thing that we talked about at the start and I think that's one thing to also think about when you're deciding to embark on language learning is the fact that some languages are more accessible. [Music]

11,6,Gretchen,"Cool, so if you need something to do between your Lingthusiasm episodes, you can listen to them too. [Music]"
11,7,Gretchen,Let's talk about linguistic cooperation.
11,8,Lauren,"Okay, we'll do it cooperatively as well."
11,9,Gretchen,"Cooperatively, yes! So, when linguists talk about cooperation, there's a kind of very specific type of cooperative meaning that exists in linguistics. So, let's do a model dialogue. Lauren, if I were to say to you, 'Would you like some coffee?'"
11,10,Lauren,"I would say, 'Coffee would keep me awake.'"
11,11,Gretchen,"And this could mean, depending on my knowledge of Lauren's time zone and her current desires and so on, that she might want coffee or she might not want coffee."
11,12,Lauren,"So if it's in the morning and I desperately need to be alert for the start of the day, it would be really great that coffee keeps me awake. But if it's 11 p.m. at night, and I am known to not stay awake very late, probably would mean that I don't want coffee. And even though there's nothing in the linguistic content there to indicate clearly whether they desperately want coffee or do not want any caffeine right now, but we can tell from interaction, we can tell from the context and the person that we're speaking to, whether that means a definitive yes or a definitive no, because we're doing something more complicated with understanding what's happening in that conversation than just looking at the words."
11,13,Gretchen,"And it's often used to be politer, so rather than saying, 'You want coffee?' 'Yep!', you might say, 'Do you want coffee?' 'Oh, coffee would keep me awake! That would be a great favour that you could do for me!' Or, 'Ehn, coffee would keep me awake...' rather than saying 'No,' which might be kind of blunt or rude."
11,14,Lauren,"We do this all the time to stop hurting each other's feelings or to kind of soften the edges of an interaction. And it's not necessarily that communication is failing, it's that communication is more sophisticated than just looking at exactly the words people say and then exactly how they reply. And it can also be used to comedic effect, and a lot of the examples we have of how this kind of cooperation works, we look at how it works by looking at when it's broken, and in comedy it's often broken for amusement."
11,15,Gretchen,"Exactly. And sometimes it's also broken to be annoying, or it feels annoying when it's broken. So one of these is the classic, 'Can I go to the washroom?' 'I don't know, can you?'"
11,16,Lauren,"Augh, I hate this one so much!"
11,17,Gretchen,It's the worst.
11,18,Lauren,"But I always find an opportunity to use it. It's very funny to use it, it's very frustrating to be on the receiving end of it."
11,19,Gretchen,"Yeah, and the thing that's frustrating about it is because the respondent is ignoring Gricean Maxims in most circumstances, unless maybe you're a patient at a hospital who's just had some sort of operation where you're, like, not sure if you're allowed to take yourself to the bathroom. Then, you know, under most circumstances the capability of someone's going to the bathroom is not in question, it's the permission to. And so we know that the relevant thing to assume there, the cooperative thing to assume there, is that this is what kind of question it is."
11,20,Lauren,And people deliberately choose the wrong definition of 'can' to reply to.
11,21,Gretchen,"Yeah, 'cause it can be kind of fun to get someone's goat, but it's also hard to articulate why this feels so annoying, why does this feel so wrong. So we are going to, in this episode, talk about what you can say that this person is violating, what this person is flouting, what the problem is when someone says that, and how you can articulate to them how annoying they're being."
11,22,Lauren,"And by not saying exactly what we mean, it can actually help move interactions onward."
11,23,Gretchen,Yeah.
11,24,Lauren,"And a lot of this has been really thought out and kind of codified as a set of ways of understanding how we navigate conversation, and the person who's often given credit for articulating this most clearly, and whose work a lot of this is based on, is Paul Grice, who is a linguist who was working on this in the 1960s, 1970s. He was a philosopher, but was very interested in the philosophy of language and semantics and meaning, and a lot of work on semantics happens in this imaginary, context-free world, or used to. Semantics was this kind of 'not thinking at all about the context of how people use language,' and Grice noticed that a lot of the time people don't say exactly what they mean, and that follows a set of conventions, and that we kind of seek out being cooperative in how we talk."
11,25,Gretchen,"Yeah, and we have certain assumptions; we generally assume that people are trying to cooperate with us, we generally assume people are trying to tell us something that's relevant and useful and cooperative to what our goals are in the conversation -- people are saying something for a reason, they're not just saying something totally irrelevant just to be annoying or just to be completely random."
11,26,Lauren,"And they're saying a sufficient amount of stuff, so if you say a lot of things, there might be a reason why you're doing that, and if you don't give much information, then there's usually a reason for that as well. And so, it's a way of understanding what's happening in those situations."
11,27,Gretchen,"And it's something that we acquire! I was looking at some research for this episode and came across a study that tested children on how well they were able to understand some of these Gricean Maxims. They tested four-year-olds, five-year-olds, and six-year-olds, and what they did is they have, like, a puppet -- they had three puppets."
11,28,Lauren,Yeah.
11,29,Gretchen,"And they have one puppet saying something like, 'What games do you know?' and then one of the puppets might say in response, 'I know how to play football,' and another puppet might say, 'I know your name,' which is the irrelevant response."
11,30,Lauren,Yeah.
11,31,Gretchen,"And so, they've asked the children which of these puppets is being cooperative, or which of these topics is being rude, or which these puppets being saucy, and trying to get them to pick. And so children who understood that you're supposed to give a relevant response to 'What games do you know?' would pick the one that said they play football rather than the one that says they know your name, because that's not a relevant response. And they found that four-year-olds generally had basically a chance understanding of these things, which might mean they understood a few of them, but not enough for it to show up significantly in the data. Five-year-olds seem to understand some kinds of cooperation but not others, and six-year-olds performed like adults. So it's a thing that happens later in your development of language; four-year-olds can talk in complete sentences, but they don't necessarily have the social understanding that adults do."
11,32,Lauren,"I feel really heartened that there's research that shows that children struggle with these Maxims, because I definitely remember as a child struggling with and having to learn how these work. I remember when I was about six, I was at something with a bunch of people, and an adult offered me some chips, like potato crisps, out of a packet, and they were like, 'Would you like some?' and I was like -- I feel so embarrassed now that I understand how these things work, but at the time I was like, 'Don't you like them?' Like, don't you like the flavor of them?"
11,33,Gretchen,That's so considerate!
11,34,Lauren,"Yeah, I was just like, if they're getting rid of these -- like, it's such a child thing -- it's like, oh, if they don't want to eat them themselves, they must not like them."
11,35,Gretchen,'Cause if I had the chance to eat chips that I liked and I would just --
11,36,Lauren,"There's no way that I would share these if they were tasty, so they must not think they're tasty. And I remember the adult had to, like, actually explain to me what they meant. They were like, 'Oh no, I just thought that maybe you would like some because I like them, but I like sharing.' So I feel really heartened that it's a thing children don't automatically understand. And it can be hard, like when you're learning a new language, you may find it difficult to understand what the politeness expectations or cooperative expectations are in your language."
11,37,Gretchen,"Yeah, this happened to me, actually, when I was an adult, but I was just somewhere -- I was travelling and I kept being like, 'Why is no one inviting me to anything? Like, I feel kind of excluded,' and it turned out that what people were doing was mentioning that events were happening."
11,38,Lauren,Right.
11,39,Gretchen,"And that I was supposed to get the inference that if I heard about an event, I should express interest in going, whereas I was trying to, like, not intrude and not express interest in something unless I was being explicitly invited."
11,40,Lauren,Interesting!
11,41,Gretchen,"And so they thought I was very standoffish and didn't want to go, and I thought no one wanted to invite me to anything."
11,42,Lauren,"I know that some people who have autism express a difficulty with navigating the implicit meaning behind a lot of things that other people take for granted, in terms of what is behind a lot of this cooperation principle, and so -- although we kind of talked about some people being annoying when they deliberately flout these things, there are some people for whom navigating these kind of implicit, cooperative conversational strategies is really, really difficult."
11,43,Gretchen,"There's an example of that on Tumblr, there's a post that's been going around that says something along lines of, 'I just realised that when you're doing something and someone asks you what are you doing, what they're really asking you is can I join you.'"
11,44,Lauren,Right.
11,45,Gretchen,"So if it's like, 'What game are you playing?', they're trying to say, 'And do mind if I join you?'"
11,46,Lauren,Yeah.
11,47,Gretchen,"And so there's been various people going back and forth about what do people actually mean when they're saying this, and is this a kind of soft invitation or something like that."
11,48,Lauren,"Yep. So, thinking about it and thinking about it overtly as a set of guiding principles for how you interact with people can also help some people to navigate them."
11,49,Gretchen,"Yeah, absolutely. And also sometimes, when they're really obvious, they can also be really funny."
11,50,Lauren,"Yeah. And we're going to basically illustrate. So, Grice breaks down the cooperative principle into four potential ways that you can use these, or flout and kind of not use them, and we're going to kind of work through them with some examples. But I think the important thing is sometimes they're talked about as rules, and I think that kind of makes it sound like it's a hard and fast, and if you don't use them then you're breaking them and it's really bad, and I don't want us to talk about it in that way."
11,51,Gretchen,"Yeah, and I think they're talked about as if they're rules, but they're really kind of baseline assumptions and we flout them all the time. And what that is doing is just adding meaning beyond the baseline."
11,52,Lauren,Yeah.
11,53,Gretchen,"And because there's lots of non-baseline meanings that you can have. And so it's just a leveling up, think of it as leveling up."
11,54,Lauren,"And the other thing is, even though we're working through these four categories, I personally often find it difficult to categorize examples of people using or flouting these cooperative principles, and often examples don't neatly fit into one of these categories."
11,55,Gretchen,"Mm-hmm. So it's helpful to think about that, that there are different categories and there are different ways of breaking them down, because not all of them seem exactly the same thing, but really any time there's an extra layer of meaning, there's probably some way that that layer is being interpreted. And a lot of them overlap a bit. The first one that comes up is what Grice calls the Maxim of Quality, and this one is like -- I always forget that it's even there, because it just seems pretty obvious and it doesn't have as many, like, fun, exciting jokes that play around with it. But the Maxim of Quality is, like, generally we assume people are telling the truth."
11,56,Lauren,Yeah.
11,57,Gretchen,"And where this shows up sometimes is that sometimes obvious lying is not interpreted as, 'Oh, this person is such a liar!', it's interpreted, 'Oh, haha, I know what you mean.'"
11,58,Lauren,"Yup, and it's often used a lot in sarcasm. So, like, you say the opposite of what you mean. You're using this understanding of, like, I will obviously say the thing I mean, but if I use this particular tone of voice and I'm saying something that is obviously the opposite, I really do mean the thing, but I'm using sarcasm to highlight that."
11,59,Gretchen,"Like if someone falls down and you say 'Nice job,' they're not going to be like, 'Why is this person congratulating me?', they're going to be like, 'Haha, very funny, you're being sarcastic.'"
11,60,Lauren,"'You're being very un-nice.' I really like it when someone is clearly caught doing the wrong thing, and you're like, 'Did you eat all the ice cream?' and someone's there with the tub of ice cream in their hand and ice cream on their face and they're like, 'Nooo... No, I didn't eat it all. I just found this empty tub.'"
11,61,Gretchen,"Or if you're at someone's house and you're like, 'Do you mind if I get a glass of water?' and there's no reasonable person that would refuse this request, probably, and the person just like, 'No.' And especially -- it's sometimes used in this case, like, 'No,' because if there was some reason why you actually couldn't have a glass of water, like if they didn't have any cups, or if their water had been turned off or something, you have to have an explanation. You'd have to be like, 'Well, oh my god, I'm so sorry, but actually this is what is going on.'"
11,62,Lauren,Yeah.
11,63,Gretchen,"'You can't have a glass of water, but I have this other thing,' or something like that. Like, you'd have to apologize if you couldn't do a very minor favour like that. But the bald 'no' there is like kind of obvious lying."
11,64,Lauren,Yeah.
11,65,Gretchen,"My other favourite example of this is on Tumblr, sometimes people will reply to a post, particularly in the tags, that they really, really like by saying 'I hate this,' or 'I'm dying,' and it means 'I actually love it.'"
11,66,Lauren,Yeah.
11,67,Gretchen,"Because otherwise why would you even reblog this so much if you hate it, or if you did hate it, you'd have, like, whole paragraphs about why it's problematic or something. You wouldn't just be like, in all caps, 'OH MY GOD THIS IS TERRIBLE I CAN'T EVEN'"
11,68,Lauren,"And it's a levelling up of your appreciation for something, so if you're like, 'Oh yeah, I really like this. I really, really like this. Oh my god, I absolutely hate this,' is like, I can't use any more superlative so I'm going this opposite strategy."
11,69,Gretchen,Mm-hmm.
11,70,Lauren,"So that is Quality. The next principle -- I'm not going to lie, like, I like them all equally, but I really like Quantity, this kind of rule of Quantity, especially when it's misused for hijinks -- which is to make what you say as informative as required, but it doesn't need to be more informative than is required for this interaction."
11,71,Gretchen,"Yeah, and that sounds very confusing, but there are some really amazing examples. Possibly my favourite -- although, oh my god, there are so many good ones -- possibly my favourite is there's a Wikipedia caption that you should definitely look at if you have not seen, which has a Scottish bagpiper at the South Pole whose name is Piper Kerr, and he's playing the bagpipes for a penguin who's standing next to him, which the caption calls an indifferent penguin. And so initially, this is what the caption said: 'Piper Kerr plays a tune for an indifferent penguin.'"
11,72,Lauren,"Then someone went back and edited it, this is like, this is the gold of Wikipedia. Someone went back and edited it to..."
11,73,Gretchen,"To: 'Piper Kerr (right),' as in the person on the right, 'plays the bagpipes for an indifferent penguin.' And what I love about this is it is entirely unnecessary, right? Like, it is way more informative than required to tell people which person in this picture is the bagpiper and which person is the penguin, because it's very clear which person is the bagpiper and which person is the penguin. Like, if you can't tell the difference between a bagpiper and a penguin, you've got bigger problems than Wikipedia captions can solve."
11,74,Lauren,"Ah, it's so good."
11,75,Gretchen,But adding in the information about which side the piper is on implies that someone might have this difficulty!
11,76,Lauren,"Yeah, like, coming back and editing it to add it in."
11,77,Gretchen,Yeah! And so it just makes the caption so much funnier.
11,78,Lauren,"My other favourite is, there was this video of this absolute, like, it's just this torrent of ducks walking in a procession along a road in China or something, but just this absolute multitude of ducks."
11,79,Gretchen,It's like a swarm of ducks. Thousands of ducks.
11,80,Lauren,"Yeah. And someone has come along and tagged it, and they're like, 'Look at all these ducks, there are at least ten.'"
11,81,Gretchen,"And then someone else comes along and says, 'Well, you're not wrong.'"
11,82,Lauren,"And, like, well, I mean, there are at least ten, but there are probably about, like, 300."
11,83,Gretchen,"But it's true that there are at least ten ducks, because there are definitely ten there, there's definitely more than ten. But we have this feeling that it's somehow unsatisfying to be like, 'There are at least ten ducks in this picture,' because the person captioning it can very clearly see that this is not an informative caption. This is violating the Maxim of Quantity, and it makes it really funny. So I actually went back to find this GIF when we were researching this episode (so I'll link you to it) and apparently -- so I wrote an article explaining how this GIF interacts with Grice's Maxims a number of years ago, and this article that I wrote about the duck GIF is now cited on the Wikipedia article about the cooperative principle."
11,84,Lauren,"Yay! It is, like, the canonical example. It should not be the principle of Quantity anymore, it's should be the principle of At Least Ten Ducks."
11,85,Gretchen,"The At Least Ten Ducks principle. And it's there under 'Violating these principles is often used for humour,' and I was really excited, because I was like, 'Ooh, someone's compiled a list of humorous examples of how this is being done! I love this! I have a list, I want to add to my list!' And then I go to the footnote, and it's like, 'Oh, it's me. That was me.'"
11,86,Lauren,"Oh, sorry you are so good at this."
11,87,Gretchen,"So on the one hand, like, I've arrived, on the other hand, I don't get a new example."
11,88,Lauren,"And you can flout this the other way, so you can be like, 'I have literally a hundred million reasons why the cooperation principle is so good.'"
11,89,Gretchen,"Yeah, you can go up, like, 'I told you once, I told you a million times.' You know, we understand hyperbole. One of the other ones that I really like is when people say 'Greetings, earthling.' And you're like, it is true that I'm an earthling, but this seems really unsatisfying as a greeting. Like, it's a funny greeting."
11,90,Lauren,Only reason that you would mention I'm an earthling is if you were not.
11,91,Gretchen,"Yeah, the only reason that earthling would be a useful quantity of information is that if you were not an earthling, or if it was some people were not earthlings."
11,92,Lauren,Yeah.
11,93,Gretchen,"And when we establish the colony on Mars, then maybe this example will no longer be good."
11,94,Lauren,"A lot of these are kind of flouted weirdly in advertising and commercial spaces where people are trying to give you information they think is cooperative and it comes across really uncooperative and I love this. There's an Australian show called The Checkout, which is about consumer rights, which sounds dry but it's actually always hysterical and worth watching. Anyway. But they have a segment regularly where they show you these kinds of things and one of my favourites is a box of running shoes. And on the box it says, 'Average quantity: 2.'"
11,95,Gretchen,Like most boxes of shoes!
11,96,Lauren,"Which is the correct quantity of shoes, but not the correct quantity of information that is needed on this shoe box."
11,97,Gretchen,Especially 'average!'
11,98,Lauren,"So I'll put a link to that segment, 'cause they often have a lot of things where you're like, 'Why would you be telling me this information?' and sometimes it's 'cause it's too much, but also because it's not relevant."
11,99,Gretchen,"Yeah, so this brings us to the next Maxim, which is called the Maxim of Relevance. And it's also -- I don't know, Quantity may be your favourite, Relevance I think might be my favourite."
11,100,Lauren,"Okay, sure. I'm glad we don't have to fight over them."
11,101,Gretchen,"It's so good. So one thing you can do -- and this is mentioned by the webcomic xkcd -- so xkcd points out that you can say on your cereal box, like, 'Does not contain asbestos.' And people'll be like, 'Ooh, I better buy that one.'"
11,102,Lauren,It does imply that all of the others somehow contain asbestos and are not telling us.
11,103,Gretchen,"Yeah, like it's somehow relevant to cereal whether there's asbestos in it, whereas that is not an ingredient of cereal. Or, an example that I came across recently -- real, real-life example -- was I bought some cheese. Mozzarella cheese. And it told me on the outside that there was no gluten in it. Gluten-free cheese."
11,104,Lauren,Does... does cheese usually contain gluten?
11,105,Gretchen,No. Cheese is made out of milk.
11,106,Lauren,"Because I had, like, a moment of panic and I was like, 'Maybe cheese contains... maybe I shouldn't have been feeding my friend cheese all this time!'"
11,107,Gretchen,"I Googled this just to be sure, and I ended up on a website for Celiac's, and they were like, if you buy a cheese product, it might have gluten in it, like as a powdered thing."
11,108,Lauren,"Okay, you sent me down a little mini path of panic then, when I was like, 'Why are they mentioning this? They can only be mentioning this if, like, all other cheese has gluten in it.'"
11,109,Gretchen,"No, but they listed all of the common types of cheese, like the cheddar cheese, and the mozzarella cheese, and the Swiss cheese, and they're like, nope, does not have gluten, does not have gluten, does not have gluten. But now you're standing in the grocery store and your gluten-free friend is coming over and you're like, 'Oh, I better buy this cheese because it says it doesn't have gluten in it, but I can't buy this other one because maybe it does!'"
11,110,Lauren,"Maybe it does. On the flip side, I always love when you get, like, a packet of salted peanuts and on the back it says, 'May contain traces of nuts.' And it is like, I don't... like, it's possibly not relevant to this product. I can imagine it's relevant for all their other products that are made on the same machine and don't have nuts as the primary ingredient."
11,111,Gretchen,"Well and in fact, it's not even just 'may' contain traces of nuts, it does contain nuts! That's the whole point!"
11,112,Lauren,It very much contains almost exclusively nuts.
11,113,Gretchen,"Yeah. Another example of this is, so, there was a Twitter account a number of years ago which was a bookstore called Waterstones Oxford Street, and they were really funny, and they've kind of stopped updating, but they had some really great tweets at the time. And they tweeted about some sort of contest that they were in --"
11,114,Lauren,Yep.
11,115,Gretchen,"And they suggested to people, 'If anybody wants to send some not poisoned gift baskets to the other contestants, you know, you should feel free to do that.'"
11,116,Lauren,That's very kind of them!
11,117,Gretchen,"Right, and so you get this interpretation of, like, they're secretly trying to egg people on to poison the competitors, and of course the whole thing's a joke. But the fact that you get from 'not poisoned' to 'actually poisoned,' because normally when you say if you'd like to send your friends some gift baskets, you don't have to specify that they're not poisoned! That just goes without saying, like, you don't poison gift baskets!"
11,118,Lauren,The default meaning is non-poisoned.
11,119,Gretchen,"Like, the default state of a gift basket is unpoisoned."
11,120,Lauren,"Definitely in English, not so much in German, but definitely in English."
11,121,Gretchen,"Oh, good point. The German word for poison is 'gift.'"
11,122,Lauren,"Yes, so putting negatives in places suddenly adds a completely -- or putting in information that seems completely irrelevant suddenly is, by the principle of cooperation, relevant."
11,123,Gretchen,"I have another really great example of that. This is my favourite one from the BBC Radio comedy series Cabin Pressure, which has a lot of really fun humour, and they're running a test. And before the test happens, one of the characters is like, 'I'm really nervous about this test, I'm not sure what's gonna be on it, I'm stressing about it.' And he's talking with the guy -- so Arthur's the one that's running the test -- he's talking with the guy that gonna be administering the test, and the guy that's administering the test says, 'Shall I tell you an interesting fact? Here's this number that you might want to know.' And Arthur's like, 'That's not very interesting.' And the test administrator's like, 'It's very interesting. If I were a young lad studying for an exam, I'd find it very interesting.' And Arthur's like, 'Oh, it might come up!' And then the test guy's like, 'Oh, I'm not telling you that, I'm just saying it's... it's interesting.' And then Arthur's like, 'Yeah, well, thanks, I just don't think it's very interesting.'"
11,124,Lauren,"Oh, poor Arthur."
11,125,Gretchen,"Yeah, poor Arthur. Arthur doesn't really get Gricean Maxims. So, it's like, why is it relevant to out of the blue suddenly come up with this statistic? Well, clearly because he is trying to imply that it's going to be on the test."
11,126,Lauren,"Yeah, paying attention to -- assuming things are relevant is definitely a good pro tip for being cooperative."
11,127,Gretchen,"Well, and the cool thing about this in conversation is that we do this all the time without even thinking about it, that stuff is relevant. So if, for example, I say, 'Do you want a cup of coffee?' and you say, 'Coffee will keep me awake,' the way that I'm able to interpret that is I assume that the awakeness properties of coffee are relevant to why you would or wouldn't want to drink it."
11,128,Lauren,"Yeah. Which brings us to the final Maxim, which is about Manner. Which basically means that it's not just what you say, it's the way in which you say it can provide a specific kind of information that's relevant to whatever conversation that you are having."
11,129,Gretchen,"Yeah, and so this kind of breaks down into if you're being excessively wordy, there's probably a reason for it. Or if you're being -- if you're saying something that looks unclear, you're probably doing it for a reason."
11,130,Lauren,Yeah. Can I share the canonical example that I remember from undergrad?
11,131,Gretchen,Sure.
11,132,Lauren,"So this is from Steve Levinson's work, which builds on a lot of what Grice did, looking at how we're polite, because a lot of this is, like, if you use or manipulate these cooperative principles, it's often because you're trying to be more or less polite in a conversation, and Steven Levinson's work builds on a lot of this in terms of politeness. And he has an example from his '83 book, which maybe shows that he's a classier individual than I am, but the example is: 'I heard you went to the opera last night, how was the lead singer?' And the other person replies, 'The singer produced a series of sounds corresponding closely to the score of an aria from Rigoletto.'"
11,133,Gretchen,That's so rude!
11,134,Lauren,"So rude! But the thing is, there's nothing overtly -- the person didn't say the singer was really bad."
11,135,Gretchen,Yeah.
11,136,Lauren,"But because they didn't overtly say the singer was good, but they kind of did this very long-winded 'they did the thing which was more or less the thing,' there is only one way to read this."
11,137,Gretchen,"Or like, 'How was the movie last night?' 'Well... it was a movie...' You're like, I guess he didn't like it, then!"
11,138,Lauren,"Yeah, so, the way in which you say something can add a particular meaning."
11,139,Gretchen,One of my favourite authors who manipulates a lot of these kinds of Maxims is Lemony Snicket. He writes A Series of Unfortunate Events.
11,140,Lauren,Yeah.
11,141,Gretchen,"And there's a quote from him, describing one of his characters, saying, 'She was entirely dressed in articles of clothing and had nothing on her feet except a pair of socks and two shoes.'"
11,142,Lauren,"No, no, no, wait, what? But that is... but, like, that is what you have on your feet."
11,143,Gretchen,"What else do you normally have on your feet? You could wear a toe ring, if you wanted to, I guess. But, like, normally!"
11,144,Lauren,"I mean, there's a bit of relevance going on here, 'cause you're like, 'Should she have skis on?'"
11,145,Gretchen,"Yeah. Flippers? So there's some Manner here where you're like, the fact that you specify this in a very elaborate sort of way, you know, shows up for this sometimes."
11,146,Lauren,"There's a really nice set from your blog, funnily enough, that kind of touches on ambiguity but also manipulates these cooperative principles quite nicely, which are ambiguous job recommendations. So if you have to write a letter of recommendation for someone you've fired and perhaps don't really like -- we'll have a link to these -- and you can see how they are deliberately well- phrased in their manner to kind of not imply what they really mean. So, for a chronically absent employee, you can say, 'A man like him is is hard to find.' And you're deliberately playing with the manner of what is expected in a job recommendation to convey the opposite of what you really mean."
11,147,Gretchen,"Or, for example, if you say something like, 'This person always showed up to the office more or less on time and was wearing clothing,' you know, this is not -- these are good traits to have at a job, but they're not sufficient to actually be good at it. But this is also Relevance, because it shouldn't be relevant in a job recommendation letter that the person wore clothing to the workplace, because that's assumed. So, they overlap a lot."
11,148,Lauren,"Yes, they do indeed. So that brings us through the four: the Quality of what you say, where generally you assume that someone's telling the truth; the Quantity of what you say, so you give as much information as you need to and no more; and the Maxim of Relation, which is that what you say has to be relevant to the particular interaction; and then Manner, so how you say it, which are kind of very broad summaries of these."
11,149,Gretchen,"One of the fun things about the Maxim of Manner is that it's sometimes phrased in a way that deliberately breaks it, I think for for fun. So it's sometimes phrased as 'be perspicuous,' which is really not very useful, because you're like, 'What does perspicuous mean?' I had to look this up! But it means 'don't do this thing, be clear.'"
11,150,Lauren,"Yeah, so it's a self-flouting Maxim there."
11,151,Gretchen,"Or, like, if you're using words that are deliberately more elaborate than -- or another version of it is 'be brief,' which can also be phrased as 'avoid unnecessary prolixity.'"
11,152,Lauren,Yeah.
11,153,Gretchen,"Which basically kind of defines itself. But again, it's not so much like, 'this is what you should do all the time' as 'this is what we generally assume people are doing.' So if you're flouting it, then it's for some sort of reason, like you want to convey that you don't actually like the thing."
11,154,Lauren,"I like people who describe it as like, they're not so much rules for the speaker as guidelines for the listener. Like, as listeners we're trying to make sense of what people are saying based on it being true and relevant and sufficient. So that's a nice -- they're not like hard and fast rules that you must obey to do language, but they do show how important context -- you know, we're big fans always on the show about, like, language use is often as much about context as it is about grammatical structures and about kind of working with people cooperatively in interaction, and there's such a nice illustration of that."
11,155,Gretchen,"I think one of the examples that I've gone back to of Gricean Maxims working in tandem, from when I was an undergrad, was if somebody says, 'I'm outta gas.' You could say, 'Oh, there's a gas station two miles up the road.'"
11,156,Lauren,Yeah.
11,157,Gretchen,"And that would be, generally, a very helpful, cooperative response. But it would not be a cooperative response if you knew that the gas station was closed, or if you knew there was actually another one that was up one mile away instead of two miles, so why are you directing people to the further one?"
11,158,Lauren,Yep.
11,159,Gretchen,"Or if you knew that you -- if you had some gas on you right now and you were like, yeah, I'm not sharing this, go to that other one."
11,160,Lauren,Yeah.
11,161,Gretchen,"So, it depends on the context for whether something is a cooperative response or not as well."
11,162,Lauren,"We have a few, if you -- because I find with these things, I find some people's descriptions or explanations for certain bits and pieces make more sense to me, so we have links to a bunch of different video clips that describe the Maxims and how they work."
11,163,Gretchen,"And there's a lot of Gricean humour, but I don't know if there are a lot of Gricean memes. But one that I do know of is somebody rewrote the song 'Amazing Grace' to be 'Amazing Grice' on SpecGram, so we will link to SpecGram as well if you would like to sing the praises of Grice. [Music]"

12,1,Gretchen,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, the podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics. I'm Gretchen McCulloch."
12,2,Lauren,"And I'm Lauren Gawne, and today we'll be talking about sounds that you can't hear."
12,3,Gretchen,Phonemes!
12,4,Lauren,"But first, so much exciting news: interview and live show!"
12,5,Gretchen,"So we reached our Patreon goal to start airing interviews on Lingthusiasm, and we are really excited to bring you an interview next month."
12,6,Lauren,"Yay! I'm so excited that we met this goal, thank you as always to all of our patrons who support the show directly and allow us to keep building and growing and bringing in new things, including interviews!"
12,7,Gretchen,"So I got to talk to Nicole Holliday, who is an awesome linguist, at the Institute this summer, it was a really fun conversation."
12,8,Lauren,"I am sooo jealous, I cannot wait to listen."
12,9,Gretchen,And we're going to bring that to you next month! It was really fun.
12,10,Lauren,"The other exciting news is that I'm gonna be in Montreal in a couple of weeks. In fact, about the time that this show goes out, for a conference and I just -- I think I know someone who lives in Montreal?"
12,11,Gretchen,"I don't know, who's that, Lauren?"
12,12,Lauren,"Oh, it's you! You live in Montreal!"
12,13,Gretchen,"Oh hey, it's me!"
12,14,Lauren,"So this is completely unexpected and a delightful coincidence, and we thought we can't pass up the opportunity while we're in the same place to not do some kind of live show."
12,15,Gretchen,"Surprise last-minute live show in Montreal, late September, it's going to be at the Argo Bookshop on St. Catherine Street, it's gonna be at 8 p.m. on Saturday the 23rd of September."

12,18,Lauren,"And I'm gonna need heaps of space in my suitcase to bring back all the maple products, so I will bring Australian-themed confectionery. If you see me there and you've listened to this episode, tell me and I will give you Australian-themed chocolate."
12,19,Gretchen,"Hey Lauren, I've listened to this episode! You should give me some Tim Tams!"
12,20,Lauren,Maybe.
12,21,Gretchen,"And also, this month's Patreon bonus episode -- I almost forgot in the excitement about all the other new stuff that's coming up -- is about linguistics research: what kinds we'd like to see more of, how to do some of your own, and all the ways to find out stuff when your friends ask you about linguistics."
12,22,Lauren,You can find a link to our Patreon in the show notes and links to all of our bonus episodes as well.
12,23,Gretchen,And go to Lingthusiasm.com or @Lingthusiasm on Twitter or Facebook for details about the live show. [Music]
12,24,Gretchen,"So, what do we mean by sounds you can't hear? This idea that language influences our perception is a really popular one in pop linguistics, and the idea of there's these words that you can't totally understand, there's untranslatable words -- Danish has this word for a sense of cosiness that we just can't understand in English -- this type of concept is really popular in pop linguistics, but it generally shows up at the word level. So you get these lists of words that are like, oh, this is this feeling, or this is this social relationship that exists in this language that you just can't understand in English, and yet the list of untranslatable words often include English translations right beside them, which I've always found kind of ironic because, 'Oh, you can't translate this except for this translation that you can see here.'"
12,25,Lauren,"There are some lovely examples of this, though. I think it's worth acknowledging that they show really interesting cultural foci, so we'll put some links to the World in Words podcast, they have a couple of great episodes on untranslatable words across cultures that are really lovely, and their whole show is generally lovely stories about language anyway, so we'll pop that in the show notes. But you're right, it's often this, 'We can't translate it in exactly one word,' not that they're completely untranslatable."
12,26,Gretchen,"Yeah, and what bugs me recently, when I've been thinking about this idea of untranslatability, is untranslatable words, you know, you can really translate them. But there's another concept in linguistics that is very well-established, very well-studied, that you really can't translate, where your linguistic experience really does shape your perception, and that's in the area of sounds."
12,27,Lauren,Right.
12,28,Gretchen,"So, when you're born, you can hear and you can perceive any sound that could be relevant for any of the world's languages."
12,29,Lauren,Uh-huh.
12,30,Gretchen,"Then by the time you hit the age of, like, three months or six months or nine months, depending on the sound pairs, you lose that ability, and you retain the ability only to perceive the sounds that are relevant for the languages that you're exposed to."
12,31,Lauren,That's so early.
12,32,Gretchen,It's so early!
12,33,Lauren,It constantly astounds me how early this happens.
12,34,Gretchen,"And this is the type of concept that when you introduce it Intro Linguistics classes, people almost don't believe it's real, because we've spent our entire lives with our perception shaped from such a very young age. It's kind of like optical illusions, you just see something and that's it. So we're just used to hearing a particular set of sounds, or used to paying attention to a particular set of sounds, irrespective of what we actually hear."
12,35,Lauren,"And so it's like growing up and only being told that the picture of the duck that rotates as a rabbit is a duck, and you're like, 'This is only a duck,' and then you can only see it as a duck."
12,36,Gretchen,"Yeah, it's this very powerful perception-type thing. Or, you know, finding out that some languages distinguish between dark blue and light blue as totally different colours. Something like, 'Look, they're just blue, like, I would call them both blue.' Um... we did a colour episode! Yeah, so it's this thing that babies are really good at. And even toddlers have already started to behave like adults. Lauren, but how do we find out what the babies do?"
12,37,Lauren,"We know this because there have been some really great and thoughtful tests on how babies perceive sound, and it allows me to talk about one of my favourite linguistic research methodologies and psychology methodologies ever, which is known as high-amplitude sucking."
12,38,Gretchen,"High-amplitude sucking sounds like, I don't know, like a band name."
12,39,Lauren,Or a really great Friday status update.
12,40,Gretchen,"Like, 'My day is just sucking, it's high-amplitude sucking.'"
12,41,Lauren,"So! How do you study -- because you can't say to a baby, you know, 'Press a button if they sound the same' or 'Press a button if they sound different.' I mean, you can say that to a baby, but it's not gonna do a lot. You can say whatever you want to -- but in order to study it... So there are a few other methodologies as well where you --"
12,42,Gretchen,"Well, let's explain how high-amplitude sucking works."
12,43,Lauren,"Yes, we'll explain this one first. So, with high-amplitude sucking it's a well-established phenomenon that if you give a baby something to suck -- it's one of the few sophisticatedly reliable fine motor skills that babies have, is this ability to suck because then they eat and stay not hungry and so --"
12,44,Gretchen,And they don't die!
12,45,Lauren,"We know this happens, and so in -- I think this started, like, in the early '70s, they started refining this methodology where they get a plastic teat and they measure the baby's frequency of how much they suck. And if you give a baby something novel to listen to, they get excited, and when they're excited and a bit stimulated, they suck harder or quicker than if they're just stuck in a room that's really boring."
12,46,Gretchen,"Yeah, so, like, all babies suck, literally, and bored babies suck slower and interested babies suck faster."
12,47,Lauren,"Yep. So if you keep playing the same sound, like, 'ba ba ba ba ba' the baby's like, 'I am so bored, I'm just gonna suck at a normal rate,' and then if you go like, 'ba ba ba pa ba,' they're like, 'Whoa, whoa, a thing changed!'"
12,48,Gretchen,It doesn't take very much to interest a baby.
12,49,Lauren,No.
12,50,Gretchen,"Like, everything is new to them."
12,51,Lauren,"And so, what they can do is they -- if that's a distinction that your language has, then the baby will be like, 'Whoa, exciting!' at two months and four months and six months and on, whereas if your language doesn't have those distinctions, eventually the baby stops hearing it and you could go 'ba ba pa' and the baby's just like, 'Oh, whatever, it's all the same to me,' and it doesn't get excited."
12,52,Gretchen,"Yeah, so all the newborns are gonna begin really interested at 'ba ba ba pa ba ba ba.' Like, 'Wow! There was something different happening!'"
12,53,Lauren,"Yeah, regardless of what language."
12,54,Gretchen,"But eventually some babies lose that ability, and other babies don't, and it depends on what language they were exposed to."
12,55,Lauren,"There are other methodologies you can use -- getting them to turn their head or the direction that they're looking in, that is another common methodology."
12,56,Gretchen,Preferred looking.
12,57,Lauren,"Preferred looking, yeah. But it's not nearly as exciting as high-amplitude sucking."
12,58,Gretchen,"Yeah, and so you can use the turning your head thing -- they find out that babies prefer, I think, the voice of the person that gestated them to any other voice, because obviously they heard that voice for nine months."
12,59,Lauren,"It may not be obvious to people, but from about the age of 20 weeks babies have ears that can hear things, and so they hear the voice of the person who is growing them."
12,60,Gretchen,"It's really cool because there is a study where they got parents to read, I think it was like a Dr. Seuss, Green Eggs and Ham or something like that, to babies in utero and for several occasions, and then once they came out of the womb, they were able to actually hear that, like, they preferred Green Eggs and Ham over, like, Cat in the Hat."
12,61,Lauren,"The stuff that they're hearing in utero is mostly, like, intonation patterns. So they don't necessarily hear all these individual sounds, but they hear this, like, [mumbling]."
12,62,Gretchen,Kind of like being underwater.
12,63,Lauren,Yeah.
12,64,Gretchen,'Cause they're literally underwater.
12,65,Lauren,More or less.
12,66,Gretchen,"Being surrounded by water. Yeah! So anyway, high-amplitude sucking is really cool, and you can use it for a lot of baby studies, and people have. And linguistically what it tells us is that babies are really good at sounds, and any baby, unless they're born deaf, is born with the ability to learn any spoken language. And then they lose this ability. But they lose it differently. So, there are pairs -- so in English, for example, English babies retain the ability to hear the difference between 'ba ba ba,' 'pa pa pa,' but they don't retain the ability to hear the difference between 'ta ta ta' and 'ʈa ʈa ʈa' and --"
12,67,Lauren,What did you just do? That sounded exactly the same to me.
12,68,Gretchen,"What I was doing was, the second ones were produced with my tongue curled back so that the bottom of my tongue was touching the roof of my mouth."
12,69,Lauren,"Ah, yeah. So this is a distinction that Nepali has, which is a language I speak but not always very well. So there's this distinction where you put your tongue, like, flat against the roof of your mouth with the top of the tongue, or you curl the tongue back and it's like the bottom of your tongue, and it's a very -- it's a sound that is in Hindi as well, it's in a lot of the world's languages, and I cannot distinguish between those two very well, especially in, like, running speech. If you do it very carefully and slowly, I can hear it."
12,70,Gretchen,"I can produce them because I know where to put my tongue, but I can't actually hear the difference."
12,71,Lauren,It's quite possible you could play me back my own voice doing it and I would not be able to discriminate them because I didn't grow up speaking a language that has them. And I often just have to get people to write words down. It's like asking someone if a word starts with a B or a P because you can't hear difference.
12,72,Gretchen,"And it's, like, super basic to speakers of the language, and you're like, 'I can't hear this at all.'"
12,73,Lauren,"I mean, it goes the other way as well. So Nepali, as a language, doesn't have a particular sound or phoneme of 'fuh.' Their 'fuh' and their 'puh' are kind of the same for them. Like, they can say the word for pumpkin is 'farsi' or 'parsi' and it doesn't really matter which one it is, you're still saying the word correctly. There's some, like, status stuff, I think it's more -- it's more fancy to say 'puh,' properly. So, Nepali has one distinction that English doesn't have and English has this other distinction that Nepali lumps all together."
12,74,Gretchen,"Yeah, so languages make kind of different distinctions. So Nepali babies at a year old are gonna be able to hear the difference between 'ta' and 'ʈa,' just like all newborns can, and just like I can't and you can't, but they're not gonna be able to hear the difference between 'fa' and 'pa' like English babies at a year old can."
12,75,Lauren,Yeah.
12,76,Gretchen,"And so we lose this ability, and there's some senses, like, linguistically speaking if I knew I was gonna grow up to be a linguist and I could have said to my parents when I was growing up, 'Hey, make sure you expose me to all the sounds and all the world's languages!' Like, should I have done that?"
12,77,Lauren,"Um, I think it's like the amount of exposure that you need means that your parents would have just had to have exposed you to a set of the world's languages that includes all the sounds, and I just don't think that's -- that's a big ask for parents who are just trying to raise a human, not a phonetically hyper-aware person."
12,78,Gretchen,"And the other thing is, it's really useful as an English speaker to not be making kind of spurious distinctions."
12,79,Lauren,Yep.
12,80,Gretchen,"Because if I say, you know, 'top' or 'ʈop,' an English speaker should hear those as the same word, because there isn't a difference between those two words, and otherwise you're potentially introducing all of these different words that are actually the same words."
12,81,Lauren,"Yeah. It's an agreement among all of the speakers that this is the inventory of sounds that we need and use, and we don't have to overwork our little brains trying to keep lots of other distinctions in the mix as well."
12,82,Gretchen,"Yeah. So nobody has all the distinctions. So there's there's other types of pairs -- in French, for example, there's the sound /y/ which in French contrasts with both /i/ and /u/, so you can have something like 'vu,' /vy/ which is the past participle of 'see' (voir, vu), or 'vous,' /vu/ which is 'you (plural or formal)', versus 'vi,' which... must be a word, somewhere."
12,83,Lauren,"It's really interesting, especially with the French one, because you know English speakers have some amount of exposure to French. It's interesting, different people will deal with that front 'y' sound, which has all the rounding of 'u' but all the position of 'i.'"
12,84,Gretchen,Mm-hmm.
12,85,Lauren,"And some people will deal with it by making it like a 'u,' and some will make it like an I character. So we kind of, in order to deal with the fact that this language has a sound in a place that we don't, we often deal with it by making it more like the sounds we have."
12,86,Gretchen,"Yeah, we make it into something like what we have. But another example is, so the sound /ɪ/ as in 'bit,' is not a sound that French has. So you'll have French speakers saying -- well, it kind of has it, but not really -- so if you have something like 'beat' versus 'bit,' for French speakers those are both just kind of 'beat.'"
12,87,Lauren,Yeah.
12,88,Gretchen,"And so, this is the kind of classic example that you get where people are saying 'beach' or 'sheet,' and they don't know how to say the other, ruder ones."
12,89,Lauren,"It explains a lot of where accents come from, is trying to take the sounds that you are used to and your brain is easily aware of and applying them to a language that has a different set of sounds in its inventory."
12,90,Gretchen,"Yeah and I think it's really cool to think explicitly about these sounds, because when you know exactly what your mouth configuration is supposed to be doing there, sometimes it's easier to figure out how to produce them. Like, I can't hear the Nepali retroflex /ʈ/, but I can say, okay, I know my tongue is supposed to be curled back like this. I can produce it even though I'm not actually hearing the distinction. And if I produce it enough, maybe eventually I'll learn it. Like, I've never tried to learn Nepali, but... Yeah, so saying, like, here's what you're actually trying to do, or in some cases, if you're trying to teach people the distinction, saying, hey, look at my mouth, look what I'm doing -- you can't always see it, because sometimes it's happening further down in your throat or it's happening somewhere that's further inside. So being able to say, 'Okay, this is what position you're trying to get to,' can sometimes help people do that."
12,91,Lauren,"Definitely. And I think it's also worth acknowledging that it's difficult, but refusing to do it is a bit of a jerk move. Like, not even trying to become aware of your language phonology inventory makes it difficult for you to speak a language and trying to correct it. So I know I'm really bad at those retroflex sounds in Nepali, but I do try and work on it, and I acknowledge that it's my limitation when I come into the language."
12,92,Gretchen,"Yeah, rather than saying, like, 'Oh, I can't even hear, this isn't even important, like why do we even...'"
12,93,Lauren,Yeah. 'Why do we even care.'
12,94,Gretchen,"'Why do we even care.' You know, saying there's this thing here that I can't perceive but is really important to the speakers."
12,95,Lauren,"And having the terminology in terms of like what my mouth is doing and being able to tell that to myself clearly, and also being aware that phonology in this way is important, makes it a lot easier for me to deal with that."
12,96,Gretchen,"So, speaking of this age of acquisition..."
12,97,Lauren,Yes.
12,98,Gretchen,"There was a study that came out a little while back about kids that were adopted from one language or another around a year of age, and they found that if you played them -- so, the one that I'm thinking of, which was out of McGill, had infants that had been born in China, had spent the first several months of their lives in China, and been adopted into French-speaking families. And when they grew up, they didn't feel like they remembered any Chinese. But they played them some sounds, I think it was from Mandarin, they played them some sounds that are relevant for Mandarin that aren't relevant for French, and their brains were still activating the way that native Chinese speakers' were, rather than the way that native French speakers who had never been exposed to a significant amount of Chinese had."
12,99,Lauren,"It just shows you how deep in the brain this kind of awareness is. When we say these are sounds you can't or can hear, we mean that there is, like, a deep effect that takes hold, and why we think this is a more, kind of difficult-to-translate-across-languages skill than particular words are. I just loved -- it's such a beautiful paper -- there was a similar one with -- just to show this wasn't some kind of one-off quirk -- there was a similar paper that looked at Korean children who had been adopted into Dutch-speaking families in the Netherlands. And regardless of whether they were adopted at 18 months or older, or if they're adopted when they were pre-linguistic, so under six months, they showed that same kind of deep acquisition of how the Korean sound system worked. So it's something that's been robustly showing across multiple groups in multiple contexts."
12,100,Gretchen,"But at the same time, they're acquiring the later exposed language at what sounds like a native level of fluency, so some of the theories around how late is it to acquire a new set of sounds in your head are often around puberty."
12,101,Lauren,Mm-hmm.
12,102,Gretchen,"So this is why learning a second or third language at a younger age can give you an advantage in pronouncing it, because you can be exposed to a whole bunch of them, and even if you're exposed to another one later, you have the ability to kind of acquire that."
12,103,Lauren,"Yeah, so it starts locking in even as early as three and four months, but you do have this kind of plasticity in your brain for these sounds."
12,104,Gretchen,"And at older ages there have been some things that say, well, hey, if you give people, like, a lot of really concentrated exposure, you can train them about the difference between certain sounds, but it does get harder, for sure."
12,105,Lauren,"Across languages, but also language-internal. I mean, different English dialects have different -- especially in the vowels, vowels tend to move around a lot more than consonants do -- but across different English dialects, there are distinctions that can be heard in some varieties that can't be heard in others."
12,106,Gretchen,"Yeah, so I have cot and caught -- the small bed and the past tense of catch -- they sound the same to me."
12,107,Lauren,Whereas to me it's cot and caught.
12,108,Gretchen,"Yeah, and I'm like, I don't know, you could be saying different sounds, like I can hear that you're saying different sounds, but I also don't care."
12,109,Lauren,"You're like, it's not important, you get by completely fine."
12,110,Gretchen,It's not important for my dialect.
12,111,Lauren,You also merge the two names that I find confusing when you merge them.
12,112,Gretchen,"Yeah, I merge the names Erin and Aaron -- like with an E and with an A, those are the same names to me."
12,113,Lauren,"We do -- especially in Melbourne English -- merge that 'eh' and 'ah,' but almost entirely in front of L. So Ellen and Alan can often sound very similar fast."
12,114,Gretchen,"Oh, those are different for me."
12,115,Lauren,There you go.
12,116,Gretchen,"Ellen and Alan are different for me. I also have Canadian raising which is -- it's actually older than the rest of your all's dialect. So, everyone else has un-Canadian lowering, in my opinion. So I have a difference between the vowel in 'house' [noun] and the vowel in 'house' [verb]."
12,117,Lauren,Oh yeah!
12,118,Gretchen,Or the vowel in 'how.'
12,119,Lauren,That's nifty!
12,120,Gretchen,"So those vowels are important to me, and what drives me bananas is when people who speak a dialect but don't have Canadian raising, or like -- so Lauren, how would you do a Canadian accent?"
12,121,Lauren,"They're kind of like, 'I doon't know what you're talking aboot!' That was really bad, wasn't it?"
12,122,Gretchen,"Yeah, so it's not 'hoose,' it's not 'aboot.' It's 'house' and it's 'about,' and those are different sounds to me. But if you don't have this distinction, you're gonna kind of, 'Oh, this is the closest thing that I think it sounds like, so I'm gonna merge it with this other sound that in my dialect is completely different.'"
12,123,Lauren,"Like, way too over-extreme."
12,124,Gretchen,"Yeah. Way too exaggerated. And I think that's one of the things that makes bad accents. Like, if someone's doing a fake Canadian accent, what makes it sound fake to me is that they're not sensitive to the distinctions that I have."
12,125,Lauren,Yeah.
12,126,Gretchen,"Or if someone's doing, like, a bad, I don't know, Lauren, Australian accent -- are they making like, distinctions..."
12,127,Lauren,"The vowels are always atrocious. They're always close but not quite, or they kind of overshoot."
12,128,Gretchen,Because you're literally not used to hearing what people who actually speak that thing are hearing.
12,129,Lauren,"No. Because I have -- you know, Australian actors all the time go to the States and become Hollywood film actors and whatever, and we just have been exposed to so much American English that I could probably do a more tolerable American accent than an American could do of an Australian, just through sheer hours of exposure."
12,130,Gretchen,"Yeah, same, we get so much American media. But the Canadian accent that people get exposed to is a very stereotyped idea of it, so that's why sometimes when you're trying to put on an accent it can sound really good to people who aren't from that place, people who are from that place are like, 'No, you're doing these four things wrong.'"
12,131,Lauren,"Uh-huh, yeah. And so many of these mergers and kind of things that are distinct in other varieties are so well-known for particular accents that they are -- like that caught/cot merger, and there's one that's the pin/pen merger where those two vowel sounds merged in some varieties of American English."
12,132,Gretchen,"Yeah, so English in the American South has the merger, so people will talk about, like, a sewing 'pin' and a writing 'pin.' And I think New Zealand English also has them merged, right?"
12,133,Lauren,"Uh... I don't want to say, 'cause I don't know what they're doing."
12,134,Gretchen,Okay.
12,135,Lauren,There's a whole vowel shift in New Zealand that is amazing and lovely.
12,136,Gretchen,"Okay, we'll have to get a New Zealander on to talk about that. Now that we have interviews!"
12,137,Lauren,Yes!
12,138,Gretchen,"And the cool thing about, you know, distinguishing between these different phonemes in English -- like, okay, here are these distinctions, some dialects have a different set of phonemes than another set of dialects -- is that in the history of English, we've also acquired and lost various phonemes."
12,139,Lauren,Yeah.
12,140,Gretchen,"And one that we've acquired, which I think is so cool, is that we've acquired a contrast between 'fuh' and 'vuh,' like the F sound and the V sound, and between 'suh' and 'zuh,' which we didn't have before."
12,141,Lauren,"And it's just very hard as an English speaker to imagine that they're not distinct, because the sounds in our head are so entrenched and robust, but it wasn't always the case!"
12,142,Gretchen,"But you can still see it in our orthography, because there's still some circumstances where you do get an alternation. So things like knife/knives --"
12,143,Lauren,"Right, that's where it started."
12,144,Gretchen,"-- or life/lives. So it used to be in Old English that you'd have 'knife' and you'd also have -- well, you'd have 'kuh-neef' -- and then you'd also have 'kuh-neevez.'"
12,145,Lauren,Right.
12,146,Gretchen,"And so because there was a vowel after the F, then -- and vowels all have your vocal cords vibrating -- then you'd get, okay, well, we'll just also produce this F with your vocal cords vibrating."
12,147,Lauren,"There you go! It's the same as, um, at the end of -- like, if you think about plural, we always write plural with an -s or an -es, but the difference between 'cats' and 'dogs' is that same S/Z distinction, but we don't think about it in that context, and that's a whole other level of phonemic complexity."
12,148,Gretchen,"Yeah, so, like half the time that we write the /z/ sound in English, we write it with an S. Like, all our plurals and words like chose, or even a word like 'of,' we write that with an F, but it's pronounced with a V."
12,149,Lauren,Yep.
12,150,Gretchen,"Then we have 'off' to write the actual F sound. And there's all this stuff kind of lurking in English spelling from back when /f/ and /v/, /s/ and /z/ were part of the same phonemes."
12,151,Lauren,Yeah.
12,152,Gretchen,"And so what happened was in English, when the Norman Conquest happened, French did have a phonemic distinction between /f/ and /v/, and they brought in a bunch of words that had /v/ at the beginning, rather than just in the middle where English had had it, but it wasn't very important. And so they brought in words like 'vine' where English had had only 'wine.' (Those are from the same root.) And so now we have this contrast in English between 'fine' and 'vine,' which we didn't have before. And so these are in the same place, it's not that it's just being surrounded by vowels that makes the /v/ sound happen, it's that this is actually important and you have to pay attention to it, because otherwise how do you know whether something's 'fine' or 'vine.' I mean, you could probably figure out, because one of them is an adjective."
12,153,Lauren,"So, all of this is in the realm of phonology, which I think is a word I've been using a little bit throughout this episode, but we've been focusing on just talking about the sounds themselves. But the area of phonology is basically taking the International Phonetic Alphabet, which we talked about in an earlier episode, and kind of applying that -- if that's the map of all the things your mouth could possibly do, phonology is what your mouth does in a particular language."
12,154,Gretchen,"And in a particular context, like which things are relevant and what kinds of systematic changes happen."
12,155,Lauren,"There are arguments for phonology in sign languages as well, but thinking more about the variation in the shapes that your hands make -- your hands as the articulators rather than your mouth. And there is some work on that as well, so it's not just that phonology is a thing that brains do with spoken languages, they also do them with sign languages."
12,156,Gretchen,"Yeah, so it's a thing that you do with the articulators that you're using to create the kind of fundamental units of the form of the language as distinct from the meaning. And there's a lot of maps about different types of phonologies that a language can have. So WALS, which is the World Atlas of Linguistic Structures, has all these maps where they've plotted dots in different colours of what kinds of phoneme inventories exist, where which languages have a contrast between particular pairs of sounds, or things like that. And a lot of languages, even if you go on their Wikipedia articles, you can see a little chart under 'Phonology' for a phonemic inventory, and what that means is these are the sounds that are relevant distinctions in these languages. It doesn't necessarily mean that they don't produce other sounds in other contexts, the way Old English speakers were producing /v/ but it wasn't actually important to them."
12,157,Lauren,Yep.
12,158,Gretchen,"But it means these are the kind of fundamental set of the ones that are super important for speakers of this language, and so there's your key to kind of unlocking what's in a language's Wikipedia article, generally, that's what's there. And we often think about languages in terms of our writing systems, we're thinking about how a language's phonology maps on to its writing system -- are all the distinctions that are relevant written? And how do you make sense of that? -- is, I think, kind of an interesting question, we're thinking about discovering stuff with different languages. [Music]"

12,162,Gretchen,Stay lingthusiastic![Music]
13,1,Lauren,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, the podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics. I'm Lauren Gawne."
13,2,Gretchen,"And I'm Gretchen McCulloch, and today we've got an interview with Nicole Holliday, who's an awesome linguistics professor at Pomona College in Claremont, California. We had a really fun chat about the linguistics of Obama and more. Really excited to bring that to you guys."
13,3,Lauren,"I'm so excited to hear your chat with Nicole. I was very excited to hear that she was gonna be our first interviewee on the show, and it's a great chat."
13,4,Gretchen,"Yeah! We had a lot of fun doing it and bringing a new voice into the podcast. But first, Lauren, we're in the same spot right now! That's weird!"
13,5,Lauren,"And it's awesome! It's been so great. So, I came to Montreal for a conference for the Research Data Alliance, a plenary conference that was here, and then because Montreal happens to be your hometown, I couldn't resist --"
13,6,Gretchen,It's a great town.
13,7,Lauren,"-- hanging out here with you for a little bit. We did a live show which was amazing! Sold out, it was so much fun, it was so great to meet other lingthusiasts."
13,8,Gretchen,"Yeah! People came! People asked questions! They clapped for us, Lauren!"
13,9,Lauren,"We had some great questions! We had some really, really great questions from people."
13,10,Gretchen,"And you can hear the live show recording by going to patreon.com/lingthusiasm. You can hear us talk about words like 'like', 'so', 'um', 'you know', 'behold', 'hark', and lots of other discourse markers, and feel like you're right there in Montreal with all the other lingthusiasts at the live show. Also, it's almost our anniversary!"
13,11,Lauren,"There's just so much exciting stuff happening in this episode, it's so great. Next month is our anniversary. It'll be episode number 14, because we can count, it's just that we launched with several episodes all at once, so that means next month is a year of doing the show."
13,12,Gretchen,"Which is really exciting. And to celebrate, because this show has been doing better than our wildest dreams, we want to continue wildly dreaming and see if we can get up to 100K: 100,000 listens across all of our episodes. We're fairly close, we think we can probably do it, but we need your help to get there. So if you know anyone who could use a little more language nerdery in their lives, this is the month to share the show on social media, email, texting, group chats, with a well-placed sticky note on your forehead -- anywhere that you think you want to share the show, we would really appreciate if you can help us get there."
13,13,Lauren,"Leaving reviews and ratings on whichever platform you use for your podcast listening also really helps other people who you don't know and we don't know to find the show and make them want to click 'play,' so leaving reviews helps people know what kind of show this is, leaving ratings helps with the way --"
13,14,Gretchen,Mysterious algorithms.
13,15,Lauren,-- the mysterious algorithms work in ranking shows.
13,16,Gretchen,"And especially people who aren't us saying, 'This show is actually good!' is always more credible than us being like, 'Hey, we have this thing that we think you might like.' I figure if you've gotten to episode 13, we can safely assume you already like the show."
13,17,Lauren,"If you send us your reviews or tag us into your posts on social media, we would love to see them, and we'll be thanking everyone that we know about in our anniversary blog post on the lingthusiasm.com website. We'll pick a couple of reviews to feature there, but we want to thank everyone that we can."
13,18,Gretchen,"Yes. Or, if you want to rec us somewhere privately and you don't like being thanked for things, we understand that, too, and you can feel the warm fuzzy glow of satisfaction of helping out an independent production, that is awesome, too."
13,19,Lauren,"We're an indie show, and we started off this independently, we do all of the work ourselves with a team that we coordinate, and you are part of that team in a very real and immediate way. You are really our marketing department when it comes to promoting the show. We have the luxury of not having to market ourselves anywhere in particular, we have the luxury of not having to do advertising."
13,20,Gretchen,We do not have to buy ads.
13,21,Lauren,"We have not had to buy ads, we've not had to offer advertising to pay for any of the show -- you do all of that, and we're really, really grateful. And we're asking you to, in this month, in the lead-up to our anniversary show, really be our marketing department and help share the show with new people."
13,22,Gretchen,"If everybody introduced the show to just one new listener, our audience would double."
13,23,Lauren,"That is indeed how basic maths works, Gretchen!"
13,24,Gretchen,"But it's great math! I like it! Like, it's true and it works!"
13,25,Lauren,"It's true and it works, and I mean, our audience is great, so I trust them to introduce us to other great people as well."
13,26,Gretchen,"And our audience has been growing and so you've already been doing this, and we figured, let's take advantage of the anniversary to have an excuse to do a little bit more and see how far we can grow."
13,27,Lauren,"So this month, recommend us, review us, or re-listen to us in a couple of old episodes?"
13,28,Gretchen,If you missed any!
13,29,Lauren,"And now, I'm so, so excited to listen to your interview with Nicole. [Music]"
13,30,Gretchen,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics. I'm Gretchen McCulloch and I'm here with Nicole Holliday in our very first Lingthusiasm interview! Yaaaay! (Say hi, Nicole.)"
13,31,Nicole,"Oh, hi! Yeah, I'm also lingthusiastic."
13,32,Gretchen,"Awesome! Good! So, we're recording this interview at the Linguistic Summer Institute in Kentucky, where I have been for this month, in July, so! Nicole, welcome to the podcast!"
13,33,Nicole,"Ah, thank you for having me! I'm a big fan, like, longtime listener, first-time caller..."
13,34,Gretchen,First-time interviewer! Nobody else got to call earlier!
13,35,Nicole,Right! I'm glad to be your inaugural interview.
13,36,Gretchen,"Yeah! So, as we're going to now ask all of our guests, how did you get into linguistics?"
13,37,Nicole,"Well, I thought that I was gonna be, like, a UN interpreter when I was a kid, and it turns out that I didn't speak enough languages because I was American, and you gotta start young. So I went to college and was majoring in Spanish, 'cause that's what you do, and I liked it, I was good at it. I was a kid who was good at school but I didn't find the thing that I was super good at, like, other kids are really good at, like, math or something, and I just, I wasn't. Until we got to high school Spanish and it was like, no, this is my jam. Why haven't I been doing this my whole life? So, in college I was double majoring in Spanish and Arabic --"
13,38,Gretchen,"Oh, fun!"
13,39,Nicole,"-- and I just happened to take an Intro to Linguistics class. And it was like... I fell in love, right. This was what I wanted to do all this time and I didn't know!"
13,40,Gretchen,"You had this, like, conversion moment, which I think is very common for linguists coming into this."
13,41,Nicole,"Yeah, I came to Linguist Jesus and I never looked back. So..."
13,42,Gretchen,That's good. And how did you get into what your research topic is -- do you wanna give us the canned version?
13,43,Nicole,"Yeah, so, I study intonation, and my dissertation work was on black/white biracial men, and I do have a story, 'cause I wrote up a paper of this when I was in undergrad. I did my bachelor's at Ohio State University. And it was 2008, when I was a sophomore/junior, and I went to volunteer for the Obama campaign in Ohio, and I went into this campaign office and I saw this man on the phone trying to sweet-talk somebody out of money, right, he was, like, super hyper-standard, like, 'Sir, Barack Obama could really use your support...' you know, whatever. And then he got off the phone, guess he got money from that person, and then this guy -- young black guy, like, from the neighbourhood -- came in and was like, 'Yo, I wanna help out Obama,' and he switched on a dime. He was like, 'My brother, Barack Obama could really use your help, okay, when are you free? Can you bring your homies?' and I was like, 'Who is this person? And how did he do that in ten seconds?'"
13,44,Gretchen,"Listeners can't see this, but Nicole is doing the appropriate gestures, you just need to picture this."
13,45,Nicole,"Yes, I did, yes. And so I ended up, you know, sort of being interested in this research question of people who are multiracial and code-switching and what it is that they change. And the more that I started to look into this, the more that I realised that I think what's going on is a lot of changes in the way that they use intonation: their tone and where their voice goes up and down and things like that. So that was the beginning of my love affair with intonation and racial identity."
13,46,Gretchen,"So did you just, like, study Barack Obama?"
13,47,Nicole,"I have so many research interests related to Barack Obama! And I got to get on them soon, because I feel like it's falling out of fashion."
13,48,Gretchen,"Yeah, there's a time span around that. Unless he goes on to have some other really interesting career in public life, where --"
13,49,Nicole,"He's writing a biography, like, he's moving to California, he'll be my neighbour, hopefully..."
13,50,Gretchen,"Oh, okay!"
13,51,Nicole,"So, yeah, he'll be around."
13,52,Gretchen,"So you can bring him in to interview him, right?"
13,53,Nicole,"Oh my god, I would die. I did meet him one time, I met him in Iowa on a campaign stop when he was in the primary, and he shook my hand, I've got a photo."
13,54,Gretchen,Nice.
13,55,Nicole,"It was, like, really important."
13,56,Gretchen,That's great.
13,57,Nicole,"But yeah, I make this joke all the time, like, 'Barack Obama is how I got into grad school.' Because at the time when I was applying, I was applying to grad school in 2010/2011, and I was writing about all of these issues of multiracial identity and how people sound and how people code-switch, and so I had this really salient example, like, everyone knew about Obama, because he was president, like, 'Yeah, it's like Obama!' And I think that gave me a really good sort of gimmick."
13,58,Gretchen,Like your hook.
13,59,Nicole,Yes! My hook.
13,60,Gretchen,"And I think people notice this, like, when he's talking with black constituents or white constituents, like, he'll shake the hands of the white ones and he'll fist bump with the black ones and, like, his speeches and stuff."
13,61,Nicole,"Yeah, so there was a Key & Peele about that, like, 'Obama deals with white and black constituents.'"
13,62,Gretchen,We're gonna link to that!
13,63,Nicole,"Yes, definitely do, it's one of my favourite clips. I show a lot of Key & Peele when I teach because they have a really good sort of -- I'm sad that they're off the air now -- but like a really good racial commentary about how you're supposed to perform whiteness, or perform blackness, or even biracialness, and I think that we've seen a lot of that with Obama. Like, he was a come-up for them, too, right? Like, Obama bringin' everybody up!"
13,64,Gretchen,"Yeah, Obama made their careers, too, in some senses. There's this sketch of Key & Peele with them on the phones..."
13,65,Nicole,"Oh my god, I love this one! So, like, what's going on is like, it's Key and Peele not being themselves, right, and one is approaching from one side of the sidewalk and the other from the other side. And they're both just speaking, you know, I would call it mainstream U.S. English or, like, you might think of it as sounding white or something, but they're on the phone --"
13,66,Gretchen,On their cell phones.
13,67,Nicole,"On their cell phones with different people. And it's like they don't know each other. And then they walk -- they converge and they meet in the middle of the sidewalk, and the closer they get, the more that they switch into this very, like, vernacular African-American language style. And then, on the other side -- so it's like, 'Yo, dawg,' -- then on the other side, each of them gets back into their mainstream voice with whoever they're on the phone with like, 'Oh my god, I just got killed. Like, there was this really scary black guy.' Right? But then both of them in the middle felt this need to sort of perform whatever this --"
13,68,Gretchen,They were each other's really scary black guy.
13,69,Nicole,"Yes, exactly. So all this is really complicated."
13,70,Gretchen,Identity is socially constructed and variable!
13,71,Nicole,"Right! It's true, it is."
13,72,Gretchen,And reflected in our language. That's a great example.
13,73,Nicole,"Yeah, that's my fave."
13,74,Gretchen,Okay. And so that led into your dissertation?
13,75,Nicole,"Yes. So, I was at NYU trying to figure out what I was gonna do for my dissertation, and I was always interested in this, like, you know, I think when I applied I was like, 'No, I'm gonna study multiracial people and I don't really know how,' and it took me a while to get to, like, what linguistic variables I was interested in? I knew that I liked phonetics, so sort of how we look at the physical properties of speech sounds, but it happened that there wasn't really anybody doing this intersection of social variation and phonetics, and particularly what voices sound like, what does it mean to sound black, or what does it mean to sound white -- both of the perspective of listeners and the perspective of speakers, right? So this became my question, and I thought that a way to get at that would be to look at people who identified themselves as having more than one racial identity. So at first I thought, okay, I'll just get these people who have one black parent and one white parent, and I'll interview them talking to white friends and black friends, because surely they speak differently to their white friends and black friends."
13,76,Gretchen,Especially when you bring them into a lab and you put a microphone in front of them!
13,77,Nicole,"Right, obviously, of course they will! But I didn't really find that. It was true for some of the speakers, but the bigger difference in the participants, that I interviewed anyway, was they were more consistent, but it had to do with how they personally conceptualised themselves as biracial or black. So, the ones that saw themselves as more black did patterns that we would be more likely to associate with, I guess, traditional speakers of African-American language."
13,78,Gretchen,Mm-hmm.
13,79,Nicole,"And they sort of spread themselves out on this continuum from the ones who identified as very biracial to the ones who identified as very black. And this is an amazing finding because we're looking at tiny, tiny things about their tone of voice that are pretty much not at the level of conscious control, but it's a still way of 'doing' who you are."
13,80,Gretchen,"And a lot of sociophonetics research is looking at like, okay, vowels -- like what kinds of specific vowels are people doing? Or what kinds of, like, what is this 'th' sound somewhere, or something like that. But this is looking at things at the level of the sentence, of the entire phrase, right?"
13,81,Nicole,"Right, of the phrase. So, how do you put it together to make something sound like a question? How do you put it together to make something sound like, 'Oh, I'm not done talking, please let me hold the floor.' Like, these kind of things. Where are the ups and downs in the voice? And we know that these are really salient, really obvious to not-linguists, but linguists haven't really jumped on this train and so... lately! But lately there's been a lot of other folks interested in what tone has to do with how you perform your identity. So beyond just vowels and things like that."
13,82,Gretchen,And that leads into the course that you're doing here in Kentucky!
13,83,Nicole,"Yeah, so, we're here at linguistics nerd camp for a whole month! We're here 'til it's the end."
13,84,Gretchen,It's honestly the best camp.
13,85,Nicole,"It's seriously the best camp, like, I'm gonna be a little sad to go home, even though I love home, 'cause Los Angeles is wonderful. I'm co-teaching a course with Paul Reid, who's now at the University of Alabama, we are longtime friends, and Gretchen has been sitting in on our course."
13,86,Gretchen,"It's a great course! I'm really enjoying it. We should link to whatever course materials you guys are gonna put online afterwards, I assume?"
13,87,Nicole,"Yeah, maybe we'll throw up a syllabus or something we can link you to. So, Paul is a -- he's my polar opposite. He is a very tall, like, 6'7"", large white man from East Tennessee, and I am very small. I'm 5'1"" and I am a biracial black woman from Ohio, but now I am full-on identifying as an Angeleno."
13,88,Gretchen,"Oh, yes."
13,89,Nicole,Los Angeles is my promised land. And we're hilarious next to each other because he's a foot and a half taller than me.
13,90,Gretchen,But you guys have a lot in common.
13,91,Nicole,"Yeah, we love each other."
13,92,Gretchen,"You're not like this mismatched thing, you're, you know, you're Key and Peele."
13,93,Nicole,"Yeah, I know, it's like my brother from another mother or something. Well, I guess father, in my case. We met each other at linguistics nerd camp four years ago when we were students, and we realised that we were interested a lot of the same questions. He's asking questions about what it means to sound like you're from Appalachia, and I'm asking questions about what it means to sound like you're black, but we're really using similar methodologies, and we want to sort of spread the good word of studying intonation among linguists. So last year, neither of us had defended our dissertations, we were just a couple months away because we were on the same sort of timeline, and we saw the call for proposals to teach classes at this ling nerd camp and I was like, 'We should do this! I mean it's crazy, but, you know...' Paul was like, 'Yeah, it's great!' So we can kind of evangelise and get people to do our kind of research."
13,94,Gretchen,"I think that's the best thing you can do with an Institute class, 'cause there are definitely your classic classes that are like, oh, yeah, we're gonna learn about, you know, phonetics or sociolinguistics or something like that. And those are good and they're often taught by people who really know the whole field here, but there's also this really cool, like, you can have a fairly narrow class that's based on someone's dissertation or based on a research interest that, like, are two things that are kind of crossed over that aren't necessarily taught in tandem with each other normally, I think that's one of the highest callings of the Institute."
13,95,Nicole,"Yeah. Oh, thank you. Yeah, we're having a really good time, the students are awesome, everybody has really interesting research ideas, and truthfully, me and Paul could just hang out together a lot. Like, Gretchen ran into us at the Starbucks this morning and we were like, 'Oh my god, but what about this pitch contour? And what about this pitch contour in this variety?! And don't you think it means X?' And she's like, 'What.' We're like, this is every conversation that we have with each other, because we just, we freakin' love this stuff."
13,96,Gretchen,"That's okay, you should see me and Lauren, it's good."
13,97,Nicole,"Yeah, yeah."
13,98,Gretchen,"So, you guys are teaching this class together, and how do you approach teaching something that isn't normally studied in this sort of way?"
13,99,Nicole,"Yeah, it's a little bit hodge-podge. So, we've had the students read a lot of things that are, like, basic sociolinguistic theory, just to understand how we think about identity. We think about identity as something that is constructed and performed, sort of online all the time, right. So it's not static, even in the example I was telling you with my dissertation participants, yeah, they're biracial, but some of them are more black more times than others, right, and they will tell you this if you bother to ask. So because identity is this sort of dynamic thing that people are always invested in performing or not performing, we have to sort of acculturate the students into thinking about identity that way, as dynamic and not static."
13,100,Gretchen,"'Cause we're used to in linguistics being like, oh, well, okay, so I can put you in this woman box, or I can put you in this black box, and that's all we're studying and we're not looking at these other type of variables. But this particular -- especially this variable is very dynamic as far as how people see themselves."
13,101,Nicole,"Yes. So we're hoping to be sort of in the future, but the other thing is the the intonation research, for a long time, has been sort of dominated by people who do formal phonology, intonational phonology, who have not really been interested in questions of variation or social questions."
13,102,Gretchen,So you get a bunch of undergrads at your university and you pay them five bucks to come in your sound booth and read a passage to you.
13,103,Nicole,Yes.
13,104,Gretchen,"And you're like, yep! It's okay that you're all white, middle-class undergrads between 18 and 24, this is just how people talk, right?"
13,105,Nicole,"Yeah, and then folks make really broad generalisations, like, oh this is the system of English because I got a bunch of fancy university undergraduates to do this, so that's how everyone talks. Obviously not. Like, I don't see myself in that, I don't see my grandma in that, right?"
13,106,Gretchen,Yeah.
13,107,Nicole,"Paul doesn't see his family in that. So like, there's definitely a lacuna."
13,108,Gretchen,"Yeah, somebody was -- I read this article about how we do so much research on lab mice that, you know, then you end up finding out all the stuff and just, like, assuming that it generalises beyond lab mice, but lab mice are this, like, very weird breed of mouse."
13,109,Nicole,For sure.
13,110,Gretchen,And undergraduates are like the lab mice of --
13,111,Nicole,Of humans? Yes.
13,112,Gretchen,"-- of humans, you know, for social psychology, or for linguistics, or any of the things where you bring a bunch of people into a lab, like brain scans and these kinds of things. Like a lot of times you're like, well, we've got this convenient sample of a bunch of 19- year-olds who are taking my intro class, and I can give them extra credit or five bucks to come into the lab."
13,113,Nicole,"Yeah. But also, like, what do you do when you do that? Right? You bias your sample: super upper-middle-class, white, you know it just -- it's bad."
13,114,Gretchen,"And they're already kind of college-educated, or half-college-educated because they're at university."
13,115,Nicole,"Yeah, and often a fancy university, right?"
13,116,Gretchen,Yeah.
13,117,Nicole,"So, this is the problem with it, like, this literature traditionally. So we're kind of bringing together the really modern sociolinguistic literature and the modern intonational phonology literature and teaching students to think about, how do you think about intonation from a sort of formal standpoint? And then go and apply that to sociolinguistic questions. So obviously we have our work cut out for us and this is a really super easy job but not."
13,118,Gretchen,"So this is gonna be your project for the next, like, 40 years?"
13,119,Nicole,"Well, yeah! And honestly, when we were talking about this course, we were both thinking, like, this is a hard thing to teach to our students in a whole semester. What if we teach it at the Institute? It was one month, we have each other --"
13,120,Gretchen,Yeah.
13,121,Nicole,"-- just as, like, a pilot run for, like, how do you teach a whole semester of something like this."
13,122,Gretchen,"And, like, how do you create the course proposal for a dean or a department or something like that."
13,123,Nicole,For sure.
13,124,Gretchen,How do we get this on the books --
13,125,Nicole,"Yeah, exactly."
13,126,Gretchen,"-- and justify that. So, if somebody wanted to dive in and do intonation research, like, 'I've been learning some of this stuff,' how would you go about doing that?"
13,127,Nicole,"Oh my goodness. Well, I will say that --"
13,128,Gretchen,In two minutes!
13,129,Nicole,"Yeah. Well, it's not the most intuitive thing. Although, you know, let me not say that. Because a lot of people have shown that listeners very easily pick up on what's going on with a tone of voice, right, we can all tell when somebody is mumbling versus when they're excited. Like, we can tell things about their emotional state."
13,130,Gretchen,"'But like, I'm not finished...'"
13,131,Nicole,"Yeah, but we can also tell things about the linguistics, right, that 'I'm not finished,' or 'this is a question,' or things like that, right. Or, like, 'I am finished with my statement.' I'd say if you're a budding linguist interested in this, you should do some work in the literature. You do need a little bit of a background in understanding phonetics, some basic things."
13,132,Gretchen,"You can go listen to the IPA episode which will not teach you enough, but it'll kind of get you started!"
13,133,Nicole,"Yeah, somewhere to begin! You know, understanding the properties of vowels and consonants, this kind of thing is really important. Understanding a what phrase is, how it's different from a sentence, right, because you've got to be able to isolate the relevant units of measure. But truthfully, after that, because you can already hear where voices go up and down, and if you've got some analysis software, you can see where it goes up and down... mostly... kinda... sort of, most of the time..."
13,134,Gretchen,"As long as you have all of your settings tweaked right, which is why I go to your class."
13,135,Nicole,"Yeah, yeah, it's it's a little bit difficult, I'm not gonna lie. But I think it's worth doing, because the work that I am getting really interested into now is about the ways in which black people can be perceived as hostile or aggressive or something like that, right, all of these negative stereotypes that exist in our culture about black people I think are augmented by how people feel about African-American English."
13,136,Gretchen,Mm.
13,137,Nicole,"So, there's not a lot of things -- African- American English speakers don't tend to use hedges or up-talk -- this thing where your voice rises at the very end, where everything sounds like a little bit? like a question? kind of like this? It's not as common. Not that no black speakers do it, some do, but it's not as common. And I think that, particularly for women, not using these sort of strategies for politeness can be interpreted as rude or hostile."
13,138,Gretchen,Right.
13,139,Nicole,"And then it ends up sort of feeding into negative stereotypes. So this is a project that I'm beginning now, I'm really interested in girls who are suspended, expelled from high school at higher rates -- black girls -- than ones who are not and comparing their baselines, patterns of these different intonational phenomena."
13,140,Gretchen,"Oh, interesting. So if the teachers are, like, over-interpreting them as hostile --"
13,141,Nicole,Yep!
13,142,Gretchen,"-- because of their tone of voice and, like, 'Oh, you sound defiant, so I'm gonna suspend you, or I'm gonna send you to the principal's office.' As opposed to, like, 'Oh, this nice little white girl, like, has this up-talk and so she sounds really polite.'"
13,143,Nicole,"Right! Well, what politeness looks like is culturally specific, right, it's not the same, and so I really have thought for a while that this is what's going on. When I was a kid I got reprimanded, like, 'Don't take that tone of voice with me,' right, and you hear me, like, I'm speaking mainstream English! But it's really hard, right, and these things are intractable. And I don't know, I mean, even just saying to teachers or saying to students or parents or whatever: Look, this is the thing that's happening. You don't need to change a thing."
13,144,Gretchen,Yeah.
13,145,Nicole,"Don't change how you talk! But rather, the onus should be on the people whose job it is to educate these students to not let their prejudices have them enforce discipline unfairly, unequally."
13,146,Gretchen,"Yeah, and if the student is actually, like, being disruptive, like throwing chairs or something, then, you know, that is still disruptive regardless of your tone of voice, but --"
13,147,Nicole,But I'm talking about what gets classified as insubordination.
13,148,Gretchen,"Exactly. But insubordination is such a judgement call, like, that's a very different thing where there's a lot of grey area for, like, is this tone of voice actually hostile? And that's where this kind of implicit bias can come in."
13,149,Nicole,"Yeah, for sure. So, stay tuned, that's where I'm going."
13,150,Gretchen,"Stay tuned! Okay, we'll have you back. Well, and you wrote this post about Sandra Bland in the traffic stop, right?"
13,151,Nicole,"Yeah, so in 2015, I wrote a post for Language Log with Rachel Burdin, who's at University of New Hampshire, and Joseph Tyler, and we, all three of us, as people who work on intonation and particularly me, a person who works on intonation in African-American English -- I watched this video... Sandra Bland was a young woman who was driving through Texas because she got a new job, and she was stopped by a police officer for failure to signal a lane change, and the situation escalated to the point where he ended up dragging her out of her car, and then she was arrested and taken to jail, and she died under, you know, maybe mysterious circumstances. Her family settled a multimillion-dollar lawsuit with the police department because there was something very suspicious about everything that happened to her. Anyway. I'm of the opinion that was very clearly racial profiling. But anyway, back to the traffic stop, because there was a dashcam of the cop's video of all this. It seems like they're escalating sort of unequally. So, the analysis that we did basically says that the kind of contours that she's using, the kind of intonation that she is using, she's, you know, maybe at a level five irritation when he stops her, and he's at a one or two, I don't know. But it seems like, because he interprets her through his own lens --"
13,152,Gretchen,Right.
13,153,Nicole,"So he hears her at a level ten when she's really at a level five, because if he were using that pattern of intonation, he would be at a level ten, because he's not a speaker of her variety of English. So they end up having this kind of emotional miscommunication, because they're actually speaking different varieties of English from each other. And I think what we came to is, she gets misinterpreted and this probably was one thing to contribute to the escalation of that traffic stop. So this is why this work is so important to me and why I'm really interested in girls who are being suspended and expelled. Like, this is not linguistics that we do for fun, just because we're curious about something. Like, this is people's everyday experiences, everyday experiences of even, you know, life and death in the case of Sandra Bland."
13,154,Gretchen,"And if you can prevent some little girls from getting suspended or expelled and changing their whole futures, like, that's a big effect to have."
13,155,Nicole,One! One!
13,156,Gretchen,One girl!
13,157,Nicole,"Or even just some teachers who just don't do this anymore. Not that -- I mean, I love teachers, like, y'all got a really hard job for no money. But a lot of times when people are participating in these things that are implicit bias, it's just because nobody ever pointed it out to them."
13,158,Gretchen,"Yeah, yeah. Well, I think you told me about this like a year ago, and ever since then I've been noticing it in myself, being like, 'Whoa! Like, I do think this person sounds angry.' But if I can recast it in my mind as, like, energetic, you know, the same way when you have nerves when you're going on a stage or something and you're like, 'Actually, I'm just excited!'"
13,159,Nicole,"Yeah, yeah."
13,160,Gretchen,"And then when you when you change that in your mind, you're like, okay, no, it's okay, like, I'm not nervous, I'm excited! And being like, oh no, she's just excited! Like, she's energetic. But I noticed it, like, after you said this to me, I was like, this is really interesting."
13,161,Nicole,Yes. We'll see -- hopefully we're already changing hearts and minds.
13,162,Gretchen,"So, the next time I have to deal with some schoolchildren..."
13,163,Nicole,Don't suspend them!
13,164,Gretchen,"But yeah, I think it's really interesting, and a lot of this type of stuff is really socially salient."
13,165,Nicole,Yeah.
13,166,Gretchen,"I think that brings us to a study that's been coming up a lot in linguistics lately, which which leads us into, like, what's a recent study that you like, that you'd recommend to people?"
13,167,Nicole,"Yeah. I love this paper, Rickford & King, 2016. So, John Rickford is a titan of the study of pidgin and creole linguistics, but also African- American English; he's at Stanford. And then a student that's been working with him there, Sharese King, who is also amazing, wrote this paper. It came out in Language in December 2016 and it actually --"
13,168,Gretchen,We'll definitely link to that.
13,169,Nicole,"Yeah. It won an award for best paper in that journal that year, which is a really -- it's like the top journal in linguistics, it's a really big deal. But they were analysing the George Zimmerman case. So, George Zimmerman was the man who murdered Trayvon Martin, and this was sort of towards the beginning of what's now the Black Lives Matter movement -- young'uns, if you don't know, go look it up."
13,170,Gretchen,Are people that young?
13,171,Nicole,"I mean...! My students are really young. And so, yeah, this is what happened. But anyway, the last person that talked to Trayvon Martin alive was Rachel Jeantel, which was his friend. And she is this Haitian-American woman, she's 18, she had low literacy, she did not have a lot of success in school, and I suspect some of that is the stuff that we're talking about, this being, like, over-reprimanded. But anyway, they analysed the ways in which people wilfully and not wilfully misinterpreted the things that she was saying in her testimony about what happened because --"
13,172,Gretchen,Like in the court.
13,173,Nicole,"Yeah, in court, because she was on the phone with him when he was killed."
13,174,Gretchen,Mm-hmm.
13,175,Nicole,So she heard what was going on.
13,176,Gretchen,So she's an earwitness.
13,177,Nicole,"Yeah, she's an earwitness, she became really important. But she was demonised for being a larger woman, black, low literacy, a teenager -- every negative stereotype was thrown at her. People on the internet were vicious."
13,178,Gretchen,It was really bad.
13,179,Nicole,"Horrible. I've never seen that, and, like, she's a private citizen. She's 18 years old, 19 years old, and she lost her best friend."
13,180,Gretchen,"Yeah, she's trying to get justice for her best friend, like what?"
13,181,Nicole,"Yeah. So anyway, Rickford and King did this analysis of a number of features that she was using, features of African-American English, things like zero copula and, like, you know -- people will call it G-dropping but I don't love to call it that -- but saying something like 'walkin'' versus 'walking.' And basically found that she was being misinterpreted, or her statements were being, it seemed like they were being misinterpreted or mischaracterised by the lawyers, on all sides of this, and the court reporters, and the jury, and everything like this, because people just literally did not speak the same language as her and they attached all of these negative stereotypes about like low literacy, like poor, like blackness..."
13,182,Gretchen,But they're not willing to give her the benefit of the doubt.
13,183,Nicole,"Exactly. No, she does not get the benefit of the doubt."
13,184,Gretchen,"Or, like, the ability to clarify or re-explain herself and be like, 'I've been misinterpreted, here's what I actually meant.'"
13,185,Nicole,"Yeah, and she was badgered, and she was young, right? And this was traumatic, and all this."
13,186,Gretchen,Yeah.
13,187,Nicole,"So what Rickford and King do is they go through, piece by piece, different points of this testimony and highlight where it seems like whoever responded to her was not understanding what she was saying."
13,188,Gretchen,Wow.
13,189,Nicole,"So there was one where the prosecutor, I think, asks her to pay attention, he assumes she's not paying attention. And she says, 'I been payin' attention, sir.' And what that means for speakers of African-American language is 'I have been paying attention this entire time or for a long time.'"
13,190,Gretchen,Right.
13,191,Nicole,But he didn't interpret it that way.
13,192,Gretchen,"So he interpreted it as something like, 'I haven't been paying attention.'"
13,193,Nicole,"Or, 'I've just started paying attention.' Yeah. So all of these little things -- it's like death by a thousand paper cuts, right -- add up to her being not painted as a credible witness and also her, you know, being kind of judged in the court of public opinion as well."
13,194,Gretchen,"Yeah, and her testimony not being taken seriously as far as getting justice for Trayvon."
13,195,Nicole,Exactly.
13,196,Gretchen,"And so that's an example of this work, another example of this work being very important, like, you know, all cops and juries and lawyers should be getting training in African-American English or in linguistics in general, sociolinguistics in general."
13,197,Nicole,"In variation, right? Like, you can't assume that a jury and a courtroom and a judge and lawyers, a roomful of people who have only ever encountered people who sound like them, are going to carry out justice evenly when they come across -- I mean and this is not just African-American English, it's people who speak English as an L2, right, people who are immigrants, and there's supposed to be provisions for people getting interpreters, but I've seen that not evenly implemented either."
13,198,Gretchen,"Well, and another thing that comes up with Rachel Jeantel was, you know, if she's a Haitian Creole speaker -- so this is something that came up at the Institute. Michel DeGraff is a prof at MIT who does a lot of work with Haitian Creole and trying to legitimize it in the school systems in Haiti as a language that can be used as a medium of instruction so kids can go to school in Haitian Creole, and they can learn stuff in there. Because at the moment, most kids in Haiti go to school in French, and so they're just taught in this language that they don't actually speak, and it's kind of assumed that Haitian Creole is just some, like, bad version of French. So he's putting a lot of stuff into saying, look, you should teach people in the language they actually understand because, surprisingly, they'll learn better!"
13,199,Nicole,"I was astonished. He had this statistic that he talked about, like 40% of the world's children are not educated in the language that they speak well, you know, speak fluently. And I'm 0% surprised, but, like, you know, you talked about in an earlier episode talking about colonialism, like, this is what happens! Like, we are so -- when people talk about institutionalised racism, like this is it, right here, the fact that Rachel Jeantel was not treated fairly as a key witness in this trial because of all of these things about the way that she was educated, as well as people's ideologies about the way that she speaks."
13,200,Gretchen,"It kind of reminds me -- so, Michel DeGraff has this analogy of saying modern French is to Latin like Haitian Creole is to French. Like, it's a descendant, it's different. You can trace genealogical relationships and origins, like there are lots of words in common and there are grammatical differences, but their difference is kind of the way a descendant language happens. And there's this domestic European history of using Latin as the language of the courts and the language of the schools, like, long after anybody actually spoke Latin in their daily life, and now it seems like we're using English and French and a couple of these big colonial languages like, you know, the Roman Empire colonized Europe and then left these far-reaching tendrils. And then the later British Empire and French empires colonised large portions of the world and left their marks in the educational and justice systems and so on."
13,201,Nicole,"Yeah, I mean, you wanna talk about how I got into linguistics, like, I also do work on Quechua languages in Peru and Bolivia, and my undergrad thesis, way back in the day --"
13,202,Gretchen,We will not link to that!
13,203,Nicole,"Yeah, no, don't, please don't. It was Quechua/Spanish bilingualism in Peru. And I was interviewing people who -- indigenous people, right -- who had grown up speaking in indigenous language, speaking Quechua, and then being educated in Spanish. And, especially the elderly people told me, they were beaten, they were physically beaten in school for speaking Quechua, like, for speaking their language, and it still goes on."
13,204,Gretchen,"Oh, I mean, it's the same thing in Canada, the U.S."
13,205,Nicole,"Yeah, rural kids in Peru and Bolivia, who are expected to show up to school in Spanish, not speaking a word of Spanish."
13,206,Gretchen,"Yeah, I think you got the same thing with indigenous people, residential schools here."
13,207,Nicole,For sure.
13,208,Gretchen,"Or even, you know, African-American kids who're speaking African-American English at home and they come to schools and like, oh, now you're supposed to be learning to read and write in this variety, whether -- you know, how close the relationship is, I think, still up for consideration..."
13,209,Nicole,"But anyway, yeah!"
13,210,Gretchen,"Like, that they don't speak the same way as the middle-class, white, middle-class kids."
13,211,Nicole,"Right, and the teachers don't understand. So, that we don't teach kids or parents or teachers about what these differences are and about how to work with them -- it's not a weakness to speak two varieties or to speak two languages, but we treat it as though it is."
13,212,Gretchen,"Well, and we treat it as though it is for specific groups of people, right?"
13,213,Nicole,"Right, for things that are not prestigious."
13,214,Gretchen,"As we talked about in the language learning episode, if you go and learn, you know, French by study abroad or something, that's very prestigious, but if you're bilingual in the home in less prestigious languages, then go into the school system, that can be seen as a detriment, which it shouldn't be. Where should people go if they want to learn more about African-American English, or African-American language? Of all of the many places that I'm sure you have."
13,215,Nicole,"Oh man, there are so many places you can go. We've got books. If you want to get deep into it, the book The Oxford Handbook of African American Language, which came out in 2015, edited by Sonja Lanehart, has literally almost every person who's ever worked on African-American English as of 2015 in there. I'm not in there, because I was still a student --"
13,216,Gretchen,The next edition!
13,217,Nicole,"But -- yeah, the next one -- but my graduate advisor at NYU, Renée Blake, does have a chapter in there. And it's got, it's like a thousand pages, like everything you'd ever want to know. If you want a more casual introduction, speaking of Professor Blake, she maintains a blog called AfricanAmericanEnglish.com and her students go through periods of editing it, so I edited it for a while and wrote for it, and it's got a lot of blog, sort of blog-type posts about different issues related to African-American English, African-American language, so I definitely recommend checking that out."
13,218,Gretchen,"So we'll link to it, we'll link to the book as well, if people get really excited and they want to read the thousand pages."
13,219,Nicole,Get it at your library!
13,220,Gretchen,"Get your library to get it, but also check out the website. And that kind of takes us into -- so, one of the things we like to do with Lingthusiasm is to bring forth examples or metaphors or analogies about linguistics that really make things resonate for people. Do you have any go-to linguistics explanations?"
13,221,Nicole,"Yeah, so I got my PhD in 2016, and since then -- last year I was a postdoc at Pomona College in Claremont, California, and now I'm an assistant professor there."
13,222,Gretchen,Congratulations!
13,223,Nicole,"So that makes me an expert for exactly five minutes, but I will say this -- living in LA is really interesting, because you get a lot of opportunities -- so another linguist friend of ours, Lauren Squires, put me in touch with a friend of hers, Zach Sherwin, who is a comedian in LA who was starting this show for the Nerdist website called Watch Your Language, so -- you'll link to that, too."
13,224,Gretchen,Yeah.
13,225,Nicole,"But so, I was the staff consulting linguist on this show last year."
13,226,Gretchen,"Oh, fancy!"
13,227,Nicole,"Yeah, but it's like an online TV show."
13,228,Gretchen,Do you have an IMDB page now?
13,229,Nicole,"Oh my god, no, but I wish I did."
13,230,Gretchen,You should!
13,231,Nicole,Somebody make me one!
13,232,Gretchen,Okay!
13,233,Nicole,"So yeah, staff consulting linguist. And Zach, this comedian, was really interested in Gricean Maxims."
13,234,Gretchen,Wow!
13,235,Nicole,"If you know what those are, it's like rules about how you're supposed to -- not rules, but, you know, guidelines -- for how you're supposed to talk so that people understand you in society."
13,236,Gretchen,Mm-hmm.
13,237,Nicole,"And the best thing that we were able to come up with was, the guy that came up with Gricean Maxims is Paul Grice, that's what he's famous for."
13,238,Gretchen,Yup.
13,239,Nicole,"But there is a member of the Wu-Tang Clan named Gary Grice! Coincidence? I think not. So he figured out, Zach, my friend figured out a way to illustrate all the Gricean Maxims -- maxim of manner, maxim of quality, all of this -- using Wu-Tang Clan lyrics."
13,240,Gretchen,That's amazing!
13,241,Nicole,"Yeah. So, he's the GZA in the Wu-Tang Clan, Gary Grice."
13,242,Gretchen,I have no idea about the Wu-Tang Clan.
13,243,Nicole,"But you should, no!"
13,244,Gretchen,I'm going to look this up now.
13,245,Nicole,"Yeah, so there's this episode of Watch Your Language where me and Zach just talked about the Wu-Tang Clan and Gricean Maxims."
13,246,Gretchen,Oh my god. How do I watch this?
13,247,Nicole,"Yeah, so if you find -- it's on Nerdist Alpha."
13,248,Gretchen,Okay.
13,249,Nicole,"If you look for Watch Your Language, it might be behind a paywall, sorry about that, but maybe not in permanence, in perpetuity, so try it!"
13,250,Gretchen,"Okay, so check back again in a couple months. We'll add an update in the show notes if we find out."
13,251,Nicole,"But yeah, people who teach linguistics, you can -- it can be done that you find a way to illustrate Gricean Maxims with Wu-Tang lyrics, so take up the challenge!"
13,252,Gretchen,"I think I knew someone that did it with the Big Bang Theory, which might be on YouTube? Like, Gricean Maxims with Big Bang Theory clips."
13,253,Nicole,"Oh, yeah!"
13,254,Gretchen,But I'm like... Big Bang Theory has its pros and cons.
13,255,Nicole,"Ugh. I mean... yeah, that's putting it lightly."
13,256,Gretchen,Some people like it.
13,257,Nicole,Yeah. Some people.
13,258,Gretchen,"I say this not knowing anything about the Wu-Tang Clan, so I don't know if I'm qualified to comment, but if we can't link you to the Wu-Tang Clan, then we will link you to its less cool substitute, the Big Bang Theory."
13,259,Nicole,"But also, like, you should do this yourself, like, figure out if you can find Wu-Tang Clan lyrics to illustrate Gricean Maxims. It's homework for your listeners!"
13,260,Gretchen,"Okay, so we've already challenged them to write fanfiction about babies in space, so the next thing is to look for Wu-Tang Clan lyrics that illustrate the Gricean Maxims. And our last question before we head out is: If you could leave people knowing one thing about linguistics, what would that be?"
13,261,Nicole,"Linguistics is not just for white people. Seriously. I teach in a college that is very ethnically diverse, but we have trouble attracting students of colour to linguistics, and it's always sort of been this way, it's been this way everywhere that I was, from my undergraduate through my PhD, now to where I teach. And I know that it seems a little bit impractical, but it's not any more impractical than sociology and I see people of colour doing that! I think that it's got this, you know, sometimes people react to you -- like, for me, at least, when I say I'm a linguist, they're like, 'Oh my god, you must be really smart.' It's the second thing after 'How many languages do you speak?' And people get weird and intimidated by it because it's one of these things that seems, like, so academic and esoteric, but we really need a lot of different types of people. We really need ethnic diversity, because, I hope I've persuaded you, there are injustices, linguistic injustices happening, and people of colour are uniquely positioned to be able to see these things, right? I saw the way that people that I knew talked differently to white friends and black friends, I see the way that this happens in school systems -- it happened to my friends when I was a kid, the way that their tone was being policed. So we desperately need you, like, come join us! And don't think that it's only for people that look a certain way, or go to a particular school that's fancy, or something like that, like, citizen linguistics is the way of the future."
13,262,Gretchen,Awesome. And if people want to find you they can hit you up.
13,263,Nicole,"Yes. I tweet mostly about linguistics on Twitter, I'm @mixedlinguist -- mixed as a biracial person and mixed as a socio-phonetician. You can also, if you go to NicoleHolliday.com --"
13,264,Gretchen,We will link to that.
13,265,Nicole,-- you can find me and see what I've been up to lately linguistically.

13,268,Gretchen,"Help us get to 100,000 listens for our anniversary, that would be amazing."
13,269,Lauren,"Lingthusiasm is created and produced by Gretchen McCulloch and Lauren Gawne. Our audio producer is Claire, and our editorial producer is Emily. Our music is by The Triangles."
13,270,Gretchen,"Today's outro is by our special guest, linguist interviewee, Professor Nicole Holliday."
13,271,Nicole,Stay lingthusiastic![Music]
14,1,Gretchen,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics. I'm Gretchen McCulloch."
14,2,Lauren,"And I'm Lauren Gawne, and today we are getting into, under, over, and around prepositions."
14,3,Gretchen,But first: it's our anniversary episode!
14,4,Lauren,Yay!
14,5,Gretchen,Wow! A whole year!
14,6,Lauren,"It's been a whole year! In the lead-up to this anniversary episode we've been asking you to recommend, review, and relisten to the show. We had the ambitious aim of hitting 100,000 listens for our first year. Thanks to your diligent sharing, your diligent reviewing, your diligent listening to the show --"
14,7,Gretchen,Your enthusiastic sharing!
14,8,Lauren,"There was so much great, enthusiastic sharing that happened."
14,9,Gretchen,"And at the time of recording, we are on track to hit that by the time this episode goes up."
14,10,Lauren,"Thank you so much! There's just, like, so much thanking happening here. Thank you for listening for this year, thank you for continuing to support the show, and we're looking forward to year two of Lingthusiasm. In the next few days we'll be posting an anniversary post thanking everyone who rec'ed us in the last month. There is still time to get your name on the list if you publicly recommend Lingthusiasm on your social media platform of choice or leave a review on your pod feeder of choice and let us know that that happened."
14,11,Gretchen,"Or if you want to just recommend us privately, you can have a warm, glowy feeling that we will confer upon you, or feel free tell us about it! People have also been asking us about merch. Are we gonna have any Lingthusiasm-themed items that you can adorn your body with? And the answer to that is yes. We now have merch."
14,12,Lauren,Yaaay! Think of this as our one-year celebration of Lingthusiasm! We are so excited about this because we decided that we would make merch that we would want to wear or use.
14,13,Gretchen,"So, not only do we have Lingthusiasm logo t- shirts and other items, we also decided to make some more fun stuff."
14,14,Lauren,"So not only do we have Lingthusiasm logo t-shirts and mugs and a whole bunch of other stuff, we also have some lingthusiast-themed items, including a range of products that say 'Not judging your grammar, just analysing it.'"
14,15,Gretchen,"So you can wear that on your t-shirt or on a tote bag and promote the idea that linguistics is about analysing language rather than judging it, so I'm really excited about that. I'm also the most excited, because I'm someone who doesn't really wear that many t-shirts with stuff on them, especially to conferences and stuff, so I'm the most excited about the fact that we also have scarves. We have scarves in a kind of subtle IPA print pattern that from far away just looks like red and white, or navy and white, or olive and white, and it just looks like you're this classy person who happens to have an interestingly patterned scarf. And then when someone gets close to you they're like, 'Wait, are those letters?' And then when they get even closer to you they're like, 'Wait, that doesn't look like the alphabet I'm used to.' And then you're like, 'Yeah! It's because I'm a linguist, I've got these IPA letters on my scarf!'"
14,16,Lauren,"I'm really excited about my navy scarf, it's really beautiful. We decided to go with Redbubble for this because they do print on demand, which means that you can choose the colour and size you want, we're less constrained that way."
14,17,Gretchen,"The scarves are one size fits all because they are a giant square of fabric, but that means you can use them for versatile purposes, if you want to use one as a tablecloth or something, or a wall hanging, you could do that as well. Or cut it up and sew something with it? I don't know, your imagination is there. I have one, it is soft, it is vibrantly coloured, I am really excited to wear it to conferences, just in time for the linguistics holiday season!"
14,18,Lauren,"By which of course we mean the Australian Linguistic Society conference in December and the Linguistic Society of America conference in January, and I will be wearing mine to both."
14,19,Gretchen,"The important linguistic holidays. Although I have to say as a Canadian that I celebrate my linguistics annual meeting in May, but I'll also be at the LSA. So this is in time to wear to conference season. We also -- because this is very important to us, they do ship internationally, they have very reasonable shipping prices to Australia, which was important to Lauren."
14,20,Lauren,"And Canada, which was important to Gretchen. And we have a link in the show notes so you can conveniently forward it to your friends and fams for the linguist or non-linguist holiday season."
14,21,Gretchen,"I'm excited to hopefully spot some Lingthusiasm fans at conferences. This is probably also a good time to mention, Lauren, that we are going to be doing 'Linguistics in the Public Ear' podcasting panel at the LSA annual meeting in Salt Lake City in January."
14,22,Lauren,"It's my first LSA! I am beyond excited to be coming to a Linguistic Society of America annual conference. I'll also be there presenting a paper in the regular sessions, but yes, we have a workshop on linguistics podcasting with a whole bunch of amazing people. There'll be detailed links in the show notes if you're coming to LSA."
14,23,Gretchen,"Yeah, with other podcasts that you may listen to or maybe you would like to listen to, so we're really excited to see those people and meet those people, and for you to get to see and meet everybody there. And you're also doing a talk about linguistics outreach at the ALS, right, Lauren?"
14,24,Lauren,"I'm also doing a workshop on linguistics outreach at the Australian Linguistic Society conference in December in the pre-conference workshop sessions, so come along to that if you are in Australia!"
14,25,Gretchen,"I will, alas, not be joining you for that. Someday I'll get to Australia."
14,26,Lauren,"Someday, Gretchen, it will happen."
14,27,Gretchen,"Someday. Okay! So, that's all really exciting. We also have a Patreon episode this month which is about the eternal question of what is a sandwich?"
14,28,Lauren,"And we put that question to rest once and for all, thanks to semantic theory, particularly prototype theory. One patron said it was their favourite episode yet, which we were totally chuffed by. So that is up on the Patreon for our patrons to listen to."
14,29,Gretchen,"And we're really close to the Patreon goal of having full bonus episodes each month, as opposed to the slightly shorter ones that we've been doing so far. So if you want to take this opportunity to listen to the back episodes of the bonus ones and get us a little bit closer towards that goal, that would be great. [Music]"
14,30,Gretchen,"Lauren, what's up with prepositions? What's under with prepositions? Are we over prepositions yet?"
14,31,Lauren,"We are going to be across prepositions by the end of this episode, Gretchen."
14,32,Gretchen,"Prepositions notwithstanding, we are going to be into prepositions by the end of this episode."
14,33,Lauren,"So to start with examples, maybe, instead of giving you a kind of rote definition of what prepositions are, because people use them all the time, a preposition will be the 'in' in something like, 'The moose was in the forest.'"
14,34,Gretchen,"Thanks for the very Canadian example, Lauren."
14,35,Lauren,You're welcome.
14,36,Gretchen,"I think you mean, 'The kangaroo was on the road.'"
14,37,Lauren,Or 'The kangaroo hopped along the road' is another one.
14,38,Gretchen,"'The moose stood in the road,' which is something that happens too often."
14,39,Lauren,"So, these are about spatial relationships. They can also be about time. So if I say 'I'll be there in an hour,' that 'in' is very different. Being there in an hour is different to being in a box."
14,40,Gretchen,"Yeah, and lots of more abstract ones like 'the antlers of the moose' or 'the pouch of the kangaroo.' So 'of' there is also a preposition even though it expresses this possession, this relationship of possession, rather than physical location."
14,41,Lauren,Yeah.
14,42,Gretchen,"So, I was really excited for this episode when we started thinking about defining prepositions, because it meant that I got to pull out my ginormous Cambridge Grammar of the English Language."
14,43,Lauren,"Which, like, it is ginormous, it's like about 1,800 pages, right?"
14,44,Gretchen,"Yeah, it's like 1,800 pages, it's almost 2,000 pages, and it has over 60 pages just about prepositions. Like, this is the kind of detail in this book. It's affectionately known as C-Gel..."
14,45,Lauren,And we will continue to affectionately refer to it as C-Gel in this episode.
14,46,Gretchen,"Because, I mean, who wants to talk about the Cambridge Grammar of the English Language? So C-Gel, which is our friend, which is this massive doorstop of a book -- like, it weighs more than my computer does, which isn't saying much these days, but still, it's huge, and it has so much about prepositions that we are not just gonna give you a dramatic reading of C-Gel -- although someday, maybe? Lauren, we should do this."
14,47,Lauren,To have a read-along C-Gel?
14,48,Gretchen,"Yeah! Like as a Patreon bonus or something, we just, like, give you a reading of the best example sentences from C-Gel. Anyway! C-Gel is great because what it does is, it's really taking to heart this idea of being a descriptive grammar of the English language and saying, 'Okay, if you're trying to describe English in all of its glory, in all of its detail, and you're trying to describe it according to sound principles of stuff you could prove, how would you go about doing that?' And, you know, 2,000 pages later, they're like, 'Yeah, we did okay.' Of, like, one particular dialect of English, which is the kind of international standard-y-ish one, with a few notes here and there on other dialects, but it doesn't even try to represent all dialects. Although I did learn -- one of things I learned from C-Gel is that Australian English has its own preposition, which is the preposition 'bush'? Do you have this, Lauren?"
14,49,Lauren,As in 'to go bush'?
14,50,Gretchen,Yeah!
14,51,Lauren,Yeah! Totally.
14,52,Gretchen,"Like, 'I'm gonna go bush this weekend'?"
14,53,Lauren,"Uh, yeah."
14,54,Gretchen,Can you say that?
14,55,Lauren,It's totally valid Australian English.
14,56,Gretchen,And what does that mean?
14,57,Lauren,"It just means you're going to go... bush! You're going to go to the place where the bush is and spend some time there. Usually in a relatively minimalist, survivalist, non-glamping sense."
14,58,Gretchen,"I have, like, 'I'm gonna go hiking,' but that's different, I guess. Okay. Because to me that just means I'm gonna, like, turn into a bush? Like, it does not... it's like a resultative, it's not a preposition."
14,59,Lauren,"Okay. It is -- I mean, it is a very fringe case preposition, but this is what C-Gel does really well, is it captures the incredible variety. So we're gonna talk you through some of the highlights of what the Cambridge Grammar of English Language talks about with prepositions, but I think the important thing to take away from this is actually there are a couple of really basic, easy facts to understand about different categories of speech, because this is a category of the language, but actually grammar is this incredibly fuzzy thing at the edges -- in the way sandwiches are semantically not always that easy, or birds are not always that easy to kind of categorise."
14,60,Gretchen,"Yeah, you think sandwiches are hard to describe? I mean, this is the fun thing -- so I think the way a lot of us encounter grammar the first time is in language textbooks. Like, okay, here's a list of all the prepositions in Spanish, you should memorise them. Or in English classes, where it's like, underline the prepositions in the sentence. And it seems like there's these very clear answers because they selectively choose for you the sentences that have very clear answers. And what's actually very interesting when it comes to looking at this type of stuff is that the version of grammar that we get presented with is this kind of 'memorise facts grammar' and the version of grammar that something like C-Gel gives us is this kind of scientific diagnostic grammar that says, 'Well, if we've got this set of criteria for what a preposition should be and we apply this to this edge case, we end up with an answer for whether this particular word that's of dubious status is actually preposition, or is actually an adverb, or is actually a verb, or something else.' And so if you like the kinds of arguments about what is a sandwich, this is actually this very similar type of argument, except it's about what is a preposition."
14,61,Lauren,Yeah.
14,62,Gretchen,"And like how you end up with a scientific definition that says, okay, a robin is a canonical bird, and a bat doesn't go within the bird category, but a penguin does, even though a bat flies and a penguin doesn't, because we've got this set of definitions. You end up with this definition of a preposition that sometimes leads us in places that traditional grammars that aren't as experimentally based wouldn't have left us there with. And so the traditional grammar definition of a preposition is it's a word that goes before a noun or a pronoun."
14,63,Lauren,"Mm-hmm. That's where the 'pre-' comes from, they're in pre- position."
14,64,Gretchen,"Yeah. So this is wrong on both counts. And this is what C- Gel points out. First of all, like, lots of stuff goes before nouns or pronouns! This is a wholly insufficient definition!"
14,65,Lauren,Yeah.
14,66,Gretchen,"So if you have a noun like kangaroo, you can say 'the kangaroo.' That doesn't make 'the' a preposition just because it can go before kangaroo."
14,67,Lauren,You say 'the big kangaroo' and 'big' is not suddenly a preposition.
14,68,Gretchen,"Or you can be like, 'I see kangaroos,' and it doesn't mean 'see' is a preposition. So this is just a completely, completely insufficient definition. And the other problem is, is stuff that comes after prepositions isn't just nouns or pronouns, so it fails on both counts. And this is something that traditional grammars kind of recognise but just kind of don't really talk about that much. So, you can actually put a preposition in front of a whole noun phrase. So you have, like, 'in the house,' not just like, 'in house.' Fine. You can have adjectives -- so if you say something like, 'They took me for dead,' 'dead' there is an adjective, but 'for' is still a preposition. It can go before adverbs like 'until recently.' So 'recently' is an adverb and 'until' is still a preposition. And in fact it can even go before other prepositions. So if you have something like 'from behind the curtain,' 'behind the curtain' is already a prepositional phrase and then you have 'from' in front of the whole thing."
14,69,Lauren,Yeah.
14,70,Gretchen,"And this is one of the places where C-Gel is like, 'Ah-ah, traditional grammar, you fail our diagnostics!' is you can put a preposition in front of a full clause. So you can say something like, 'We can't agree on whether we should go' and 'agree on' -- that 'on' is still a preposition by their definitions because they're like, 'Well, if it already failed our noun and pronoun test, why not have it go in front of this thing as well.' And even though in a traditional grammar you call that a subordinate clause, they're like, 'Look, subordinating conjunctions: maybe not a real thing? Why not just call them prepositions? Because they sure look like prepositions, and this thing that we thought prepositions did, they already don't do, so why not these as well.' And the same argument they have for solo prepositions. So if you say something like 'the resident of this house isn't in the house.'"
14,71,Lauren,Yeah.
14,72,Gretchen,"Then 'in' is very clearly a preposition. But you can also say 'the resident of this house isn't in,' and the 'in' seems to be like..."
14,73,Lauren,So it's not before anything!
14,74,Gretchen,"It's not before anything! Whoa! It seems to be doing basically the same thing as it was before, like, it should still work. In the same way that you can say something like 'I'm eating an apple' or 'I'm eating,' and 'eat' doesn't have to have 'apple' even though it could, you could say something like that. So they have this kind of expansive definition of a preposition, but the advantage that it has is that it's a more coherent definition of preposition, and it's one that you can use as kind of a lens to test other words on. So they say it kind of canonically or generically generally takes a noun phrase, but the other uses can be seen as an expansion of that."
14,75,Lauren,"And I think if you think of it as a thing that generally marks spatial or temporal/time relationships that usually goes before an NP, you're actually fine. In the way that most of us don't have to think about whether bats or penguins are more like birds or not, we can leave prepositions, the penguins of grammar, to the grammar professionals who write things like C-Gel, so you're not actually required to memorise that definition, that's just a way of looking at that kind of complexity."
14,76,Gretchen,"Yeah, and like, the definition does have its appeal, and the kind of canonical examples do have their appeal, because you could say, well, here's here's your canonical example. And what it does let you do is it lets you give this very exhaustive treatment where they've got like several pages each on the difference between prepositions and verbs, the difference between prepositions and nouns, and, like, how you can decide when you have all these edge cases. So they have -- they talk about phrasal stuff, like -- so you have phrases like 'by dint of.' Like, 'I established what a preposition was only by dint of half an hour of talking.' And so you might think, okay, well, the 'by' and the 'of,' those are pretty clearly prepositions."
14,77,Lauren,Yeah.
14,78,Gretchen,"And so if you're like, well, maybe this is like another kind of -- like, what's the 'dint' doing? So if you think of it like a preposition, uhh... you can -- but you can't do things like 'dint of hard work achieves wonders,' or 'she achieved this by hard work's dint.' So, like, normally you can replace 'of' with the possessives. You can say, like, 'the photo of me' or 'my photo.' But you can't say 'she achieved this by hard work's dint.'"
14,79,Lauren,"No, you can't say that in normal English at all."
14,80,Gretchen,Or 'the hard work of which she achieved this by dint.'
14,81,Lauren,"I think, I mean, it is just worth saying really overtly here: a preposition can be more than one word. So, 'by dint of' or 'as soon as.'"
14,82,Gretchen,"Well, yeah, they have this whole criteria for like whether they should be multiple words or not, and I'm not even going to get into that and how to analyse the multiple word thing."
14,83,Lauren,"But for the sake of the take-home message, we often think of prepositions as being those teeny-tiny ones like 'in,' 'on,' 'at,' but they can also be multi-word as well."
14,84,Gretchen,"Well, and they had this interesting argument for 'home' as a preposition a lot of the time. So obviously sometimes home is a noun because you could say, like, 'my home.'"
14,85,Lauren,Yup.
14,86,Gretchen,"But sometimes if you say, 'I'm going home' or 'I'm home now,' that seems to have kind of an inherent preposition inside it."
14,87,Lauren,"Yeah, you don't say 'I'm in home.'"
14,88,Gretchen,"No, you don't say 'I'm in home,' and you could say -- the same way that you could say 'I'm going inside,' which clearly has an 'in' there, you say 'I'm going home.' 'I'm going downstairs.'"
14,89,Lauren,That's nice.
14,90,Gretchen,"Yeah! And it's like, wait a second, that's so weird! But it works!"
14,91,Lauren,"By the time you get to this point in the diagnostics, it's not outside of the preposition space in particular."
14,92,Gretchen,"Yeah, yeah! And yet, I don't know, I find that one really hard to wrap my head around. But I love it. So the other thing that's kind of cool about the word 'preposition' is that it has a preposition in it. So 'pre' is a preposition in Latin and can be used as a preposition in English, like you can say, kind of artificially, but you can say, like, 'I had lunch pre going to the meeting.'"
14,93,Lauren,Yep.
14,94,Gretchen,"And a preposition often indicates a position in time and space. So even though they aren't always words that come before a noun, which is where the word initially comes from, they do often indicate a position, and pre is one kind. But you can also have, like, postpositions."
14,95,Lauren,"So these are ones that come after the thing instead of before it. So, for example, 'a long time ago' -- 'ago' is a postposition there."
14,96,Gretchen,"Yeah, and 'notwithstanding.' So 'notwithstanding' is kind of interesting in English because it could be either a preposition or a postposition. You can say 'notwithstanding the weather, the picnic shall go on.' Or you can say, 'Weather notwithstanding, there shall be a picnic.'"
14,97,Lauren,"And just to be typologically completionist, you could have circumpositions, where you have a bit of the meaning before and after. So all of these are referred to as adpositions, technically. Although you will often find, even a language that has postpositions, in a grammar for English speakers they're called prepositions."
14,98,Gretchen,"Yeah, so 'preposition,' although you can decompose it into 'pre' and 'position,' a lot of people don't think of it as separate pieces anymore."
14,99,Lauren,"In order to be, like, properly self- defining, these terms should technically be pre-position position-post and... circ-position-um?"
14,100,Gretchen,That's amazing. I'm gonna make that happen.
14,101,Lauren,I don't think that's gonna take off.
14,102,Gretchen,I think we should make that happen. I don't see how that would be confusing at all.
14,103,Lauren,"Just to make them properly, clearly self-defining."
14,104,Gretchen,"Yeah, I mean, it's kind of like how you have prefix and suffix, which I guess should actually be fixsuf or something?"
14,105,Lauren,Yeah.
14,106,Gretchen,"We're working on this. We're working on this. Okay. And this is one of those things that you can chop if you go to other languages. So, Japanese is probably the most famous linguist example of a language that has postpositions. So you would say something like 'Tokyo-ni', which is the same thing as 'to Tokyo,' but the 'ni' comes after Tokyo instead of before. Neither of us actually speak a language with postpositions, which is very inconvenient, we should have picked our typology a little bit more carefully..."
14,107,Lauren,"Um, Yolmo does."
14,108,Gretchen,"Oh, Yolmo does?"
14,109,Lauren,Yeah.
14,110,Gretchen,Okay.
14,111,Lauren,"So you say 'Nepal-la,' which means 'in Nepal,' or it also means 'to Nepal,' and we'll talk about semantics shortly. It's not entirely clear -- it is prepositional, it has all the semantics and function that we think of as pre- or postpositions, but you might recognise that function at the end of the word like that if you speak a language that has case. And so case kind of tells you what role the noun has in the sentence, just to give the kind of nutshell definition there. And in some languages postpositions are kind of the case marker and it's not very clear that there's no separate function for them. In other languages you have case and you have prepositions as well, I think Latin is a language that has both?"
14,112,Gretchen,"So, Latin has both case and prepositions. So if you use the Latin preposition 'in,' which is obviously related to the English preposition 'in,' and the word 'casa,' meaning house, you could say 'in casa,' which would be the ablative case, meaning 'in or on the house.' But if you say 'in casam,' that will mean 'into or towards the house.'"
14,113,Lauren,Okay.
14,114,Gretchen,Because the case differs along with that preposition.
14,115,Lauren,Yeah.
14,116,Gretchen,"So, like, you definitely can have both, but in other cases, a language will have a lot of cases for stuff that we might do with prepositions."
14,117,Lauren,Yeah.
14,118,Gretchen,"So I think Finnish is famous as having, like, 14 cases, which sounds really complicated, but some of them actually pretty much just correspond to what you might do with a preposition."
14,119,Lauren,"Yeah, I remember when I learnt Polish I felt a bit, uh... it was the first language with case that I had learnt very well, and I think I felt a bit... cheated? Because everyone had always talked about how case was this really stressful thing and I was like, well, a lot of it is just... prepositional semantics. So, the space there is not always distinct."
14,120,Gretchen,"Yeah, so if you look at something like the comitative case, which just means the 'with' case, and it just corresponds to most of what you would do with 'with.' It's like, okay."
14,121,Lauren,"With with. One thing I did find difficult was Polish, though, was the semantics of different prepositions. So you'll often find, when you're learning a new language, is that you will maybe get the definitions translated for you at the beginning of the textbook, or the beginning of the course, but what you find is different semantics come into play. And so there are two different forms of what roughly get translated as 'in' or 'to' in Polish, which is 'do' and 'na.'"
14,122,Gretchen,Mm-hmm.
14,123,Lauren,"And you use a different one depending on the place that you were going to. So something like a shop tends to be used with 'do,' and a big, open place like a stadium tends to be used with 'na.' So there's like a difference between things you are going to or in that are big and kind of open, and things that are small. And it just took me so long to get my head around it, and I used to come with a different set of examples... I was just... we could always tell I was gonna be a linguist, couldn't you. I would just be like, 'What about a cinema?' and my teacher would be like, 'Hmm...'"
14,124,Gretchen,How big is it?
14,125,Lauren,"'I think that's 'do.'' And then I'd be like, 'What about an open-air cinema?'"
14,126,Gretchen,"Oh, no. That is peak linguist right there."
14,127,Lauren,Yeah.
14,128,Gretchen,"Yeah, this reminds me of -- there's this thing in French, the preposition you use with the country varies depending on the grammatical gender of the country."
14,129,Lauren,Right.
14,130,Gretchen,"So France is feminine and that means you say 'en France' to mean 'in France,' but Canada is masculine and that means you say 'au Canada.' And it's not because of the song."
14,131,Lauren,Okay.
14,132,Gretchen,"Because it's spelled differently. And so you have to know the gender of the country in order to know the right preposition to use with it. Except if it's a country that begins with a vowel, and it's feminine, then you say 'en' again."
14,133,Lauren,Right.
14,134,Gretchen,"Yeah, and then, like, islands do a different thing, because like... and then cities do something else..."
14,135,Lauren,"Right. So sometimes a preposition will encode information in one language that they don't have in another. So in French, gender is necessary for prepositions."
14,136,Gretchen,"Yeah, so French prepositions often fuse with the definite article -- the same with Spanish -- and because they're both really small words and they kind of fuse together, and then that means that they start to do things that the article does because the articles encode gender and number in those languages. So, yeah, there's lots of interesting ways you can kind of slice up the domains of relationships between objects."
14,137,Lauren,"I just want you to think for a minute, if I tell you something is on the fridge..."
14,138,Gretchen,Okay.
14,139,Lauren,Where...
14,140,Gretchen,It's like a magnet.
14,141,Lauren,The magnet is on the fridge.
14,142,Gretchen,"Yeah, it's sticking to the fridge, it's got like a, you know, you put up your kid's drawing or your postcard or something on the fridge."
14,143,Lauren,Okay. And what if I said the spare fry pan is on the fridge.
14,144,Gretchen,"I don't have 'fry pan,' it's like lido... but yeah, yeah, so if you have, like, the bowl is on the fridge. I'm like, wait a second, you can't stick a bowl to a fridge! I guess you put it on top of the fridge?"
14,145,Lauren,"Yeah, so we have the same 'on' for things that are, like, either vertically or horizontally... We also have, like, the ring is on a finger, and that's like... around on? It's not really on..."
14,146,Gretchen,That's true!
14,147,Lauren,"It's kind of all around. And other languages will cut this up differently. So, Spanish does the same -- or at least the Spanish that's in my example, maybe you speak a Spanish that isn't. But for Dutch they are different prepositions. So the picture is 'aan' the wall, the mug is 'op' the table, and the ring is 'om' the finger..."
14,148,Gretchen,Mmm.
14,149,Lauren,...are all different prepositions because they are semantically very different.
14,150,Gretchen,"Yeah, those are different things! Like, I could think about those differently, but I just haven't had to."
14,151,Lauren,Yeah.
14,152,Gretchen,"And I think we do have ways of, like, clarifying them, right? Because if I say the bowl is on top of the fridge, I can't be like -- if I say the ring is on top of my finger, that means something very different."
14,153,Lauren,"Yes, it does. You have very good balancing skills. My other favourite one that I learnt -- in linguistics, not because I know the language, but just because I thought the semantic differences of seeing the world was so great -- is that Korean has, essentially, not an in/on distinction like we have, but a tight fit/loose fit relationship between objects. So 'the ring is on the finger' and the 'apple is in the bowl' are different for us because it's on and in, but in Korean, something that's snug and fit, like a ring on a finger, or a pen lid on a pen... or something like an apple in a bowl would be... that would be a more loose fit."
14,154,Gretchen,"Or stuff like -- there's this Tumblr that's like, 'Things fitting perfectly inside other things.'"
14,155,Lauren,Yes.
14,156,Gretchen,"It'll be like, this apple fits inside this roll of duct tape or something."
14,157,Lauren,That Korean preposition for 'snug fit' would be a perfect description of what is happening on that blog.
14,158,Gretchen,"That's amazing. And then 'loose fit' is like this other thing. So if you have like a -- like my watch is pretty loose-fitting, is that tight or loose? I'm... I don't know."
14,159,Lauren,"I have no Korean intuition about this, Gretchen."
14,160,Gretchen,"Oh, yeah, okay. Somebody who speaks Korean tell us how this... whether... like, I can fit a finger in between my watch and my wrist. Does that make it loose? I don't know."
14,161,Lauren,We'll have to ask a Korean speaker to help us.
14,162,Gretchen,Okay.
14,163,Lauren,"But semantics -- like, it's not just cross-linguistically. Cross varieties of English you can get different prepositions that are preferred. And I've got two sentences here, I'm going to have a blank, and you need to think about what preposition you would use in these sentences."
14,164,Gretchen,Okay.
14,165,Lauren,So: I am standing [blank] the platform.
14,166,Gretchen,I think I would say on the platform?
14,167,Lauren,Okay.
14,168,Gretchen,Okay.
14,169,Lauren,And: I am standing [blank] the station.
14,170,Gretchen,Uhhhh... at the station? I'm second-guessing myself now.
14,171,Lauren,So I would say I am standing on the platform.
14,172,Gretchen,Okay.
14,173,Lauren,And I am standing in the station.
14,174,Gretchen,"I think I could say that, too."
14,175,Lauren,"Or at the station. In British English, I used to hear all the time, in, like, announcements -- so, like, formal, announcer-recorded message announcements: 'If you are standing on the station, please...'"
14,176,Gretchen,"Ohhh, I don't have that."
14,177,Lauren,"'...don't litter' or something. No! And every time, it would just, like, twing my native speaker intuitions in this really uncomfortable way."
14,178,Gretchen,"Huh. Yeah, I don't have that at all!"
14,179,Lauren,No.
14,180,Gretchen,"'Cause I was second-guessing myself, being like, 'Is it in or is it at?'"
14,181,Lauren,"Either is completely tolerable, and then 'standing on the station.' And I think it's just 'cause like -- that they kind of have a Polish sensibility about it, being some kind of big, open, you know -- standing on the field, standing on the road, standing on the station -- and I'm just like no."
14,182,Gretchen,"I mean, there's other examples of this. One that I'm aware of is standing -- so if I say I'm -- like, if you're at the bank or something and there's a line of people and you want to wait your turn, you could stand [blank] line."
14,183,Lauren,"Oh, yeah. I stand in the line."
14,184,Gretchen,"I stand in the line as well, but in some places you stand on the line."
14,185,Lauren,"Yeah, no. Only if there's a line drawn on the ground."
14,186,Gretchen,"Yeah, then I can stand on it. Yeah, no, but somebody was -- I saw somebody tweeted recently a photo of -- I want to say New York City, maybe?"
14,187,Lauren,Yeah.
14,188,Gretchen,"And there was a sign, you know, again, this very official signage, that said, 'If you're standing on line, blah blah blah...'"
14,189,Lauren,Wow.
14,190,Gretchen,"And so this was clearly the idiom there. So, yeah, there's all sorts of different things you can do with prepositions in terms of, like, microvariation."
14,191,Lauren,"And the kind of semantics around that. On the topic of people thinking and talking about prepositions, we would be remiss not to mention the advice to not end sentences in prepositions that is often bandied around."
14,192,Gretchen,"This is okay. It's terrible advice, but it's one of my favourite pieces of linguistic terminology."
14,193,Lauren,It's one of your favourite pieces of linguistic terminology in what way?
14,194,Gretchen,"Okay. So, the angry grammarian sort of story is there are some of the early English writers -- so, Robert Lowth wrote this English grammar in the 1700s, and he has this kind of suggestion that gets transformed into a prohibition."
14,195,Lauren,Right.
14,196,Gretchen,"So he says, 'This is an idiom which our language is strongly inclined to --' notice the preposition ' -- it prevails in common conversation and suits very well with the familiar style in writing, but the placing of the preposition before the relative is more graceful, as well as more perspicuous, and agrees much better with the solemn and elevated style.'"
14,197,Gretchen,And so...
14,198,Lauren,That was very solemn and elevated.
14,199,Gretchen,"Thank you. I try. It's hard to do quote marks, so I figured I had to sound pretentious instead. So, his schtick was he would take examples from writers like Shakespeare and Milton and so on where they had done these things that he was criticising and call them false syntax and say don't do this."
14,200,Lauren,"Okay. Whatever hobbies you got, mate."
14,201,Gretchen,"It's like, have fun! But the cool thing about this whole sentence preposition ending thing is that what it's talking about is the difference between something like, 'this is an idiom which our language is strongly inclined to' versus 'this is an idiom to which our language is strongly inclined.'"
14,202,Lauren,Right.
14,203,Gretchen,"And so you have this sense that, sure, 'our language is strongly inclined to this idiom,' and when you pull up the idiom part and you put a 'which' there, are you going to bring the 'to' with you or not?"
14,204,Lauren,Mm-hmm.
14,205,Gretchen,And so leaving the 'to' behind when you've pulled up the idiom part is known as preposition stranding because you've left it all behind on its little island.
14,206,Lauren,"Aw, poor preposition! Stranded!"
14,207,Gretchen,"And when you bring the 'to' with you, the literature calls it Pied Piping."
14,208,Lauren,Ohh!
14,209,Gretchen,"So, I don't know, is this a story that everybody knows?"
14,210,Lauren,"I always love a good story, so... It's because the -- it's coming with it, so it's like being Pied Pipered along."
14,211,Gretchen,"Yeah, so there's like the Pied Piper of Hamelin. And the town of Hamelin has a big rat problem and they get him to play his pipe and pipe the rats away, and then when they won't pay him he takes their children, pipes their children away too. It's a kind of gruesome story! But you can imagine a little bit of grammar playing its pipe and Pied Piping the preposition up into the sentence with it."
14,212,Lauren,"Come with me, little preposition!"
14,213,Gretchen,And that is this great metaphor.
14,214,Lauren,For how prepositions get moved.
14,215,Gretchen,"Yeah, so, basically -- hypothetically this rule could say 'don't strand your prepositions, Pied Pipe them instead.'"
14,216,Lauren,And we would be all the better for it!
14,217,Gretchen,"Don't leave them all alone on their little island, 'cause they get sad. Instead you pipe them up into the forest like the children and the rats. I don't know. And like as our buddy Robert Lowth says, this is a thing that English is strongly inclined to, and the idea that you shouldn't do it in English has kind of become this cliche joke that no reputable grammar guide says not to do, but it's got a fun name. So for that, I'm okay with it. But these prepositions can do whatever they want."
14,218,Lauren,"And that's a very different approach to prepositions than what we saw in the Cambridge Grammar of English Language. So there are different ways to approach grammar and some of them are to tell people to do things in a particular way, and that particular way just happens to look like Latin a lot, just saying... Or there's the approach where you take a lot of examples and try and understand what is happening from a descriptive perspective, and a lot of grammars that fall at many intervals in between those two points."
14,219,Gretchen,"I will say that much as I am in favour of the descriptive kind, the Pied Piping thing has an advantage in terms of cool terminology."
14,220,Lauren,Definitely.

15,1,Lauren,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics. I'm Lauren Gawne."
15,2,Gretchen,And I'm Gretchen McCulloch. And today we're talking about how we talk about time.
15,3,Lauren,"But first, we have very exciting news for 2018, which is: twice the number of full episodes of Lingthusiasm every month!"
15,4,Gretchen,"So, up to this stage, we've been doing Patreon bonus episodes, which are sometimes a little bit shorter, one of them is a text chat episode, and sometimes they're cut bits from the show -- now we actually have enough support on Patreon to do full-length bonus episodes. So that means two Lingthusiasm episodes a month for people who support us on Patreon. We are really excited to have grown this far in this short amount of time."
15,5,Lauren,"We'll still have free episodes every month through the main channel, but we'll also have another full-length episode, which means you get more bang for your Patreon buck."
15,6,Gretchen,"Yeah! So, thanks to everyone who has brought us there so far and it is not too late to start listening to these and all the previous Patreon episodes as well! We also released Lingthusiasm merch last month -- IPA scarves, T-shirts and mugs and bags that say 'Not judging your grammar, just analysing it', and Lingthusiasm stickers. And they have been very popular, we have been very much enjoying seeing people's photos of them and stories about who they got them for, so feel free to keep sending us those. We're excited to see what you end up doing with them!"
15,7,Lauren,"We were so excited when we put this -- especially with the scarves and the 'Not judging your grammar' -- yeah, we were so excited when we were putting this together and it's been so nice to actually be able to share it with everyone and everyone else also getting really excited about it."
15,8,Gretchen,"And we're really excited to see some of that gear and some of our listeners at the Linguistic Society of America annual meeting in a few weeks in January. So, we'll hopefully see some of you there!"
15,9,Lauren,"Our current Patreon episode to round out the year is a question and answer session that we did at our Montreal live show. So if you want to know what it's like to have the opportunity to ask us some questions, if you want to relive the live show experience, that is available on the Patreon now!"
15,10,Gretchen,"It had a really good energy, people asked really good questions. And it was really fun to have that kind of more back-and-forth than we normally get to do in the episodes. So you can check that out and all the previous bonus episodes at patreon.com/lingthusiasm. [Music]"
15,11,Lauren,"There's a quote that circulates around on the internet, one of those ones where the original author is lost to time, that for me sums up I think a lot of what we're going to cover in the episode today, which is, 'You are a ghost driving a meat-coated skeleton made from stardust.'"
15,12,Gretchen,Hmm. That is both weird and cool.
15,13,Lauren,"And I really like this quote because for me, it takes something that we take for granted, our lived experience of how we move through the world, and it kind of just unhinges that for a second and makes you reflect on how really weird human bodies and human social interaction is. And I feel like a lot when I teach linguistics classes, a lot of my class is just me going, 'Look at this really obvious thing you've done your whole life, think about how weird it is for a moment, think about how weird it is that we actually communicate with each other functionally.'"
15,14,Gretchen,"I think a lot of the times when we're talking about linguistics, we end up talking about the 'meat suit' part of, like, this is what your tongue is doing. Just think for a second about the fact that you have a tongue! It's pretty weird! Or this is what your vocal cords are doing, or the weird flaps of skin and the rest of your throat are doing, or the, you know, neurons that you can't see. And there's there's a lot of physical aspects to language that says, okay, well, spoken languages tend to have certain kinds of similarities because that's just how the human vocal tract is designed. Or sign languages have certain kinds of similarities because that's what your hands can do. Like, there aren't any sign languages that require you to stand on your hands. Or spoken languages that require you to, like, bite your tongue to make the word, because humans don't want to do that! And I think the part that we often miss is that in addition to being in meat-coated skeletons, we're also on a planet. We're on the same planet. And some of our experiences as speakers of any of the languages on this planet have certain kinds of similarities with each other because of that planet, and a lot of those are related to time."
15,15,Lauren,And so that is our topic for today. We're gonna talk about talking about and thinking about how time works.
15,16,Gretchen,"So Happy New Year's, Earthlings! We're gonna talk about time."
15,17,Lauren,"We are being a bit end-of- year, just-after-first-anniversary reflective here, but we think it's relevant all year round."
15,18,Gretchen,"Yeah! And, you know, one of the big things is that we're on a big ball of rocks and water and we have this sun in the sky, and so languages have words for day and night, and mark the passage of time with days and with years, because those are things that all different human societies have observed. And we have a moon, which gives us things like months. And there are roughly twelve of them in a year, so twelve is this important number for different measurements of time."
15,19,Lauren,"I didn't really think about how important twelve was for time until we started listing places where it crops up! So it crops up, obviously -- we talk about twelve-hour cycles in the day, and we have 24 hours, so that's two sets of twelve there."
15,20,Gretchen,"We have things like twelve signs of the zodiac, or twelve months in a given year. And we also have other types of time-related things that are divided up into twelves, like the minutes and the hours on a clock get divided. So an hour gets divided into sixty parts, which is, you know, divisible by twelve. And then a minute gets divided into sixty parts, and so I looked up -- because I was thinking, you know, why is it that a second is called the same as, you know, the 'first, second, third, fourth'? And that's not actually --"
15,21,Lauren,Is it a coincidence? I had always assumed it was.
15,22,Gretchen,"No! No! It's not a coincidence! I kind of vaguely assumed it was a coincidence. But actually, in medieval Latin -- and this is according to Etymonline, which is great -- they divided the hours into various kinds of small parts. And the first part of the hour was called the 'pars minuta prima', or the first small part. And 'minuta' there is related to, like, 'minute' or 'miniature.'"
15,23,Lauren,"Right, yeah."
15,24,Gretchen,But it just means small. And so that's where a minute comes from. And that's the first small part. And then the pars minuta secunda --
15,25,Lauren,"Ahh, I see where this is going!"
15,26,Gretchen,-- is the second small part! And that's the second.
15,27,Lauren,Right.
15,28,Gretchen,Which is another sixtieth. And there actually used to be a term for a sixtieth of a second --
15,29,Lauren,Right...
15,30,Gretchen,"-- what we would now use a millisecond for, which was called a tierce, or a third, which is the third small part, which is yet another sixtieth of a second."
15,31,Lauren,"Ahh. Like, seconds are so simple and salient to me, having grown up with them, that a tierce, like a third, just sounds so weird? But a millisecond is completely fine. You can see the modern decimal system of influence --"
15,32,Gretchen,Modern decimal system kind of encroaching on the second! Yeah!
15,33,Lauren,"Wow, imagine if we still measured things in thir... thirds?"
15,34,Gretchen,Thirds!
15,35,Lauren,Thirds.
15,36,Gretchen,"Or tierces, if you want to be Latin-y about it."
15,37,Lauren,Tierces! Yeah.
15,38,Gretchen,"But, I mean, we could have ended up -- you know, we have milliseconds now. The French Revolution, which was one of the things that introduced the metric system, also tried to introduce a ten-day week instead of a seven-day week."
15,39,Lauren,"Ah, yeah, I heard about this. There's a great Twitter account that just tweets out whatever day it is in the old French revolutionary calendar."
15,40,Gretchen,"Oh, that's great. Yeah, they named them all after, like, agrarian things, right?"
15,41,Lauren,Yeah.
15,42,Gretchen,"So, there have been attempts to do that, but for some reason the seven-day week and -- I guess the nice thing is is that if you divide a 28-day month, which is kind of a lunar month, into four parts, you get this seven-day week, even though there's no other reason to use seven because it's this weird prime number."
15,43,Lauren,"And a ten-day week, it's a long time to the weekend."
15,44,Gretchen,"But if you have a three-day weekend, maybe?"
15,45,Lauren,"Like, you're never gonna win people over. I would rather get a two-day weekend after five days than a three-day weekend after seven."
15,46,Gretchen,"I don't remember exactly how they gave the days off, maybe they had one halfway through? So it would be like three and then one and then three and then... how do you do math? What's left? Two more?"
15,47,Lauren,"I'm not a French revolutionary, I'm sorry."
15,48,Gretchen,Well...
15,49,Lauren,We'll have a link in the show notes page.
15,50,Gretchen,"So, there's all these different ways of slicing and dicing time and yet we've also ended up with this very weird calendar system that has all of these artefacts in it, like the fact that September, which has 'sept' in it, which means seven, is actually not the seventh month, it's the ninth month. And October, which has 'oct', meaning eighth, and it is actually the tenth month, and so on and so forth, because January, February didn't really use to be a thing, and so if you started counting at March, they work out. But yeah, there's lots of weird things about weird artefacts that get snuck into our time-counting systems. The other really cool thing about time -- so, this is a study about children called 'Learning the Language of Time: Children's acquisition of duration words.'"
15,51,Lauren,Right.
15,52,Gretchen,"And it's by Katharine Tillman and David Barner, and they noticed, or people have noticed, that kids start using time-related words around the age of two or three, even though they have no idea how clocks work for like several more years."
15,53,Lauren,"I would say definitely several more years, yep."
15,54,Gretchen,Until like eight or nine.
15,55,Lauren,Yeah.
15,56,Gretchen,"So what do they mean if they're saying the word minute, or if they're saying the word hour, if they don't actually know what a clock means?"
15,57,Lauren,Right.
15,58,Gretchen,"And so they got dozens of three- and six-year-olds in the lab and they asked them to compare several different pairs of durations. So their example was, 'Farmer Brown jumped for a minute, Captain Blue jumped for an hour. Who jumped more?'"
15,59,Lauren,Uh-huh.
15,60,Gretchen,"And they also use seconds, days, weeks, months, and years. And by age four, the children tended to get more of these questions right than you'd expect if they were just guessing. And as they got older they got better and better at that."
15,61,Lauren,So they know an hour is longer. They may not be able to tell you exactly how long.
15,62,Gretchen,Yeah.
15,63,Lauren,Hmm!
15,64,Gretchen,"But then! They asked them things like, 'Farmer Brown jumped for three minutes, Captain Blue jumped for two hours. Who jumped more?' And adults are like, yeah, this is still really obvious, and the kids were like, I don't... I don't know?"
15,65,Lauren,"Wow. Stumped them! That's like, oh, yeah, as an adult, you're like, this is so painfully obvious, how can you not get this."
15,66,Gretchen,"Like, why are you asking this? But this is why we have science, right, so you're not just like, this is so obvious. But yeah, so kids get thrown by this: well, it's three minutes, but it's two hours, like what... what... what are you gonna do? Whereas we know that an hour is an order of magnitude larger than a minute, it doesn't matter if you just add one."
15,67,Lauren,Yeah.
15,68,Gretchen,"And kids also do this type of things for numbers and colours. They have these kinds of general concepts of them before they have a very good idea of the specific details. So a kid might be able to use a word like hundred or thousand, probably -- this is me inferring from their study -- but they're not actually counting all them, they just see a lot of cookies and be like, 'Wow! There's a hundred cookies!' And there's actually twenty. But they have the sense that a hundred is a lot."
15,69,Lauren,I'd still be happy with twenty cookies.
15,70,Gretchen,"You know, so would I. But, you know, counting is a thing."
15,71,Lauren,"Yeah, and so we have the kind of general semantics. And it's that thing, like, we do it as adult speakers as well, right. Like, we say, you know, I'll often message you and I'll be like, 'I'll be online in two minutes!' And you can expect me any time within the next one to ten minutes."
15,72,Gretchen,"Yeah, oh yeah, and if you're ten minutes there I'm not like, oh, you're eight minutes behind, it's like, ah yeah, that was kind of in the order of magnitude."
15,73,Lauren,I've started the stopwatch!
15,74,Gretchen,"Especially if you think about how parents or adults talk about time to kids, it's like, 'Yes, yes, yes, I promise, we're gonna go in a minute!' And then like twenty minutes later the parent's like, 'I guess we're going now!'"
15,75,Lauren,"Yeah, it is very confusing to learn to navigate this."
15,76,Gretchen,"Yeah, 'You can watch TV in a minute!' and it's actually like, you know... Or like, 'In an hour!' and it's actually three hours or it's actually half an hour. I think parents know that kids don't really understand those those times, and they're often not very precise about them with kids because it's just easier to give a general impression. But I think the classic way that I remember counting time when I was a kid was with sleeps. So you would say things like, 'Three more sleeps until we're gonna go visit your grandparents!' And that was three more days, but somehow it was easier to count sleeps."
15,77,Lauren,I think there are only like four or five sleeps until Christmas when this episode comes out?
15,78,Gretchen,There you go!
15,79,Lauren,Depending which time zone you're in.
15,80,Gretchen,Depending on when you listen to it. Maybe they're listening to it like a year from now.
15,81,Lauren,You can only listen to this episode on any given 21st of December.
15,82,Gretchen,"So, yeah, there's like three more sleeps! French also has this word, but they don't use the normal word for sleep, they use a baby talk word, which is 'dodo'. So you can say, like, 'Trois dodos!' And that means three more sleeps because you're using the baby talk register."
15,83,Lauren,"That's cute! I mean, I guess sleep, A Sleep, is a weird... like, I think I only use it with children."
15,84,Gretchen,Yeah!
15,85,Lauren,Use sleep as a noun?
15,86,Gretchen,"I mean, I think you can say like, 'I slept the sleep of the just' or something if you want to be more formal."
15,87,Lauren,"Yeah, but not to a three-year-old! The other thing I've always found really hard to get my head around with time is that different cultures obviously have different times that they celebrate the new year, that the concept of a new year and counting years is completely arbitrary. And in Nepal there are about five different ethnic groups that have five different dates that they measure New Year's on."
15,88,Gretchen,"Oh, that's exciting."
15,89,Lauren,"It's always so amazing! It's like this thing that you think is this really important thing, and then you discover that other people, for other people your new year means nothing and they've got their own thing going on."
15,90,Gretchen,"Yeah, and it's interesting how the year itself is so universal, but the time when you when you pick it is so arbitrary. Whereas something like a day, like we all have the same kinds of dawns and sunsets, because that's built in, but for a new year, sometimes people go for a solstice or an equinox, sometimes people go for a lunar calendar, where the years don't actually quite match up because you're caring more about the months -- you know, there's lots of different types of years."
15,91,Lauren,"There's also a lot of cultural variation in how people conceptualise where they are in time and how time happens. And this is more or less a really elaborate culture-wide metaphor that different cultures can have. So when you hear 'metaphor' you might think of, like, school comprehension classes where you've learnt that, like, 'the sun is a big yellow balloon' is a metaphor and 'the sun is like a big yellow balloon' is a simile and both of them are equating something with another property. And that is true and you can use them as a very specific literary device, and in those cases the more novel, the better. But we also have these metaphors that are really pervasive in how we see the world and our place in them."
15,92,Gretchen,"And they're so ingrained that you don't even think about them as metaphors, they're just how things are."
15,93,Lauren,"No, so we really have to think about ourselves as souls in meat-covered skeletons on a bowl of rocks hurtling through space. And this kind of area of semantic -- it's really a kind of a property of semantics and cognitive linguistics -- is probably best encapsulated, or kind of kicked off through a work by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson. So a lot of the work in this area is inspired by them and their book 'Metaphors We Live By,' because they're so pervasive. So, for example, we have a lot of things like 'last year is behind us,' 'we can move forward,' 'I can't wait until Christmas,' like, 'Christmas is coming up really quickly' are all --"
15,94,Gretchen,"So, time can move quickly in a way that's kind of weird. I think even just saying like, 'Oh, I'm looking forward to when we're gonna do this,' that's like, the future is ahead of us, the past is behind us. Or, like, 'let's just put that behind us,' meaning let's just forget about it."
15,95,Lauren,"Yeah. So we have an orientation where the future is ahead and the past is behind us. And so we have two slightly different ways of thinking about this in English. We can say, like, 'I just have to get to September and then I can go on holiday' and so we're moving through space towards September or the future or whatever is happening, and then --"
15,96,Gretchen,"Hmm, okay."
15,97,Lauren,"But we have a slightly different one where like, 'Christmas has come up so quickly!' where we're kind of stationary and time is flowing past us. But what's common to both of those is the future is --"
15,98,Gretchen,"Like, 'I can't believe we've arrived at December already.'"
15,99,Lauren,"Yep. But future, pretty safely anchored in front of us. Whereas there are other cultures, and the most famous one is Aymara, which is an Aymaran language of South America -- so with Aymara, the future is behind us and the past is in front of us. And if you think about it, it makes a kind of sense, because we know what happened in the past. You know, I know what happened to me yesterday. I am not psychic and I don't know what's gonna happen to me tomorrow. So it makes sense that the future is in the part of your vision where you can't see and you don't know what's there, but you can look out over your life and where you've come from as you've travelled through. So it actually, like, it's a really robust logic and it's totally the opposite metaphor, but it's encoded in their language the way our way of talking about time is encoded. Another common one that's often talked about is, especially in various Chinese languages where you have a vertical orientation of time, where the past is above and the future is below. And that's partly the the writing system that motivates that, and we have, even though it's not in our speech, we often see in our gesture, not only do we have this forward- backward space orientation, but we have a left-to-right orientation. So if you think about plotting out everything you have to do in the next couple of days on a timeline, then you're more likely to put events earlier on the left and events later on the right."
15,100,Gretchen,"Right, so, okay, I'm gonna do this and then I'm gonna do this and then I'm gonna do that."
15,101,Lauren,Sometimes we have these metaphors that are so deep in our consciousness they don't even show up in our speech but they show up in the way that we orient ourselves.
15,102,Gretchen,"But if we were using a right-to-left writing system like Arabic or Hebrew, we would probably plot out things on a timeline in the other direction?"
15,103,Lauren,"Yeah, there's been so little research that's really nailed a lot of this down. Lera Boroditsky is a cognitive psychologist who's done some work on Chinese and English monolinguals and bilinguals, and she's found that, especially with Mandarin speakers, you can get them thinking vertically or horizontally depending on how you prime them before you do the experiment, which is cool."
15,104,Gretchen,Interesting.
15,105,Lauren,"So there's both long-term, like it's very hard for us to think about time forward and backward, but you can also prime people to think about these metaphors in more short-term ways as well."
15,106,Gretchen,"And people often use, you know, even just an arrow going from left to right to indicate things about the future."
15,107,Lauren,"Yeah, so Hillary Clinton's 2016 election campaign logo, which was very unpopular at the time, and I wrote about it and what the arrow was doing in the H as it pointed to the right. And also FedEx has that little optical illusion arrow in the logo."
15,108,Gretchen,"Oh, yeah!"
15,109,Lauren,"And if you look at it, they would never have done that logo if the writing was such that it went from right to left, because that wouldn't be indicating kind of future-y dynamic forwardness."
15,110,Gretchen,"Yeah. Oh that's kind of like -- so email programs do this, right, if you have, like, the reply arrow has this kind of circle back pointing to the left, and the forward arrow has it going towards the right. And those are just arrows, like, your email contacts don't exist in time and space, but they're using those arrows to kind of transmit those ideas."
15,111,Lauren,Yep. So these metaphors are really pervasive in how we talk and think about time.
15,112,Gretchen,So FedEx doesn't want to make you think that they're gonna run off with your package and take it back to the factory.
15,113,Lauren,"FedEx your package, just comes back to you every time."
15,114,Gretchen,And that's what would happen if they used the arrow in the other direction.
15,115,Lauren,"Yeah, that would be... that would be a not-good... And, you know, it's -- I've written some stuff about emoji direction. So, they're oriented so they make sense in terms of Japanese word order."
15,116,Gretchen,Mm!
15,117,Lauren,But in terms of English word order it makes it look like people aren't moving forward from left to right and so they're not moving forward in time. And English speakers get really irritated by that. So the vehicles and the people walking all point from right to left. And we interpret that as like they're going backwards.
15,118,Gretchen,"Oh, okay. Whereas if you spoke Japanese, because that language is subject- object-verb and then you want to put the verb at the end of the sentence so that you can be like, yeah, this refers back to the thing that was at the beginning."
15,119,Lauren,"Yeah, so in that language it's pointing the right way, but for English speakers it doesn't gel with our sense of things moving forward. And so I love this way because you really, you know, time is so hard to get our hands on that we have to use whatever strategy we can and these metaphors are a really nice way to do that, but we really take them for granted. Sometimes you're just like oh, wow, yeah, that's how we... that's how we move through the world!"
15,120,Gretchen,"Yeah! Another thing that I take for granted a lot is that, you know, time is this abstract concept, but for some of us, and I'm one of them, we actually have this kind of intuitive way of visualising time. So there's a phenomenon known as synaesthesia, which is when you have kind of cross-sensory perception. So the classic example of synaesthesia is grapheme colour synaesthesia, which means that certain letters or numbers have particular colours associated with them, and I have that as well and we'll probably talk about that in some other episode, but in this particular context I want to talk about time- space synaesthesia a little bit, because this is actually one of these kind of -- it's less talked about and it's a lot more common I think than people were realising, that a lot of people have instinctive visual metaphors, a kind of a mental image or an image in your mind's eye, of where different times of day are, where different days of the week are, where different months of the year are, hours in the day. So..."
15,121,Lauren,"Hmm! Yeah, I definitely haven't heard of that as much as I've heard of colour letter/grapheme synaesthesia."
15,122,Gretchen,"Yeah, the grapheme one, I mean, it's easier to visualise because you could just put that stuff in different colours, whereas the -- you know, I think I've looked at some of the diagrams that come with the studies and I'm like, 'That looks really weird!' But also I know I have this thing, mine just looks different from that. So the classic example that you generally see in time-space synaesthesia studies is -- so, I think most time-space synaesthetes visualise time as a circle. Which kind of makes sense, because all of our time things, like hours in the day, months of the year, they repeat and they're cyclic around each other."
15,123,Lauren,Yeah.
15,124,Gretchen,"And the classic one that you see in the visualisations is that someone will be standing in the centre of this big ring. And in the ring are the different months of the year, in order, and the one that's in front of the person will be the current month. So let's say you're looking at December and you're like, this is the month that we're in right now, and then beside it will be January 'cause you're flipping over to the next year, and you'll just keep going around. And it'll kind of move in front of you as time progresses."
15,125,Lauren,Right.
15,126,Gretchen,"And some people have it in kind of a bit of an elliptical shape, like it's not just generally a perfect circle, it's not like a hula hoop."
15,127,Lauren,Hmm!
15,128,Gretchen,"It's this kind of elliptical shape, and sometimes it's tilted a bit, sometimes there are colours involved... This is this kind of thing that people have. For me, I have it as a loop, but I have it as a up-down loop that circles around in the back."
15,129,Lauren,Okay.
15,130,Gretchen,So rather than like the hula hoop thing --
15,131,Lauren,So you're not standing in the middle of it.
15,132,Gretchen,"I'm not standing in the middle of it, I'm looking at it. It's kind of like if I was going to take my watch off and hold it in front of me so I could see the face of it, then that would loop behind itself as well."
15,133,Lauren,Okay.
15,134,Gretchen,"Except it's bigger than that. And it doesn't have a watch, it doesn't have a clock face on it. And I have the same mental loop for both hours of the day and months of the year. So midnight is where January is."
15,135,Lauren,Okay.
15,136,Gretchen,"And it goes through. And noon is around where June is, and it goes through -- like, midnight and January are at the top and then it kind of loops in the back very quickly and it just kind of goes around there. So, I was trying to look for this visualisation that I'd seen before of the months around the person, and I ended up on this article that was trying to describe this. And it was saying that, oh, people who have time-space synaesthesia, they're like Time Lords! And they have all these...! And I just... you know, I don't have magical powers here, people."
15,137,Lauren,"Do you use it mentally when -- if you're like, okay, I have to do this thing in September, so I have four months to do it, like, is...?"
15,138,Gretchen,"Yeah, I mean I use it in -- like, I do use it to kind of keep track of where I am, going about my day, or knowing when something is, or 'how soon is that,' 'how far is that.' Like, 'this feels far away,' 'this feels close by.' I use it for that. And I did notice -- so I was in Hawaii in March this year. And I left Montreal in the cold and then Hawaii has these beautiful, balmy temperatures, obviously. And I noticed that I was in the wrong spot in my mental calendar? And I felt like I was in July, because that's what the weather was like, even though I was in March? So I had a really hard time calculating times for several weeks afterwards, because I just -- my body had decided that I was in July now. Like, my brain had somehow decided that I was in July now and I was really not. It's kind of like a macro version of -- you know that thing where you have this sense that it's Tuesday but it's actually Thursday?"
15,139,Lauren,Yup.
15,140,Gretchen,"And you don't know why it feels like a Tuesday, but it feels like a Tuesday, and there's a way that Tuesday feels?"
15,141,Lauren,"That, for a year."
15,142,Gretchen,"I had that for like several months, 'cause I got really thrown off."
15,143,Lauren,"Oh, how disconcerting."
15,144,Gretchen,"It was pretty bad. Now that it's getting cold here again, it's better, I'm like, it's definitely winter now. But it really messed me up, yeah! So, yeah, it's like, I'm not a Time Lord, my apartment is not bigger on the inside..."
15,145,Lauren,How disappointing.
15,146,Gretchen,"I know, I tried, but they don't sell TARDIS apartments."
15,147,Lauren,It'd be very convenient.
15,148,Gretchen,Yeah.
15,149,Lauren,"Do you find that you assume other people are kind of visualising time in this way as well, or do you find that it clashes with those other cultural metaphors about time?"
15,150,Gretchen,"Um, I just kind of take it for granted, like, I don't really think about it very often, it's just there? It's kind of like you don't think about how what your mother looks like, you just know. Or like --"
15,151,Lauren,You don't think about the fact that you're a meat-puppet skeleton.
15,152,Gretchen,"You don't think about the fact that you're a meat puppet in space! Sometimes I do see calendars that for some inexplicable reason will put their earlier times at the bottom. So there's this website that I've been visiting a lot lately which tells you when the sunset and sunrise times are for your location -- because I'm really counting down the days to when we can start moving out of this darkness, and I'd like my sun to start rising again at, like, earlier than four o'clock -- and for some inexplicable reason, this sunset website, it starts its midnight, 1:00 a.m., 2:00 a.m., at the bottom and its evening at the top."
15,153,Lauren,That is very confusing.
15,154,Gretchen,"And that just throws me every single time, and I don't know why they're doing it! But yeah, that really messes me up. But I think that would mess most people up, because --"
15,155,Lauren,That would definitely mess me up.
15,156,Gretchen,"Because if you're using an agenda or something, all of our metaphors at, like, later in the day is at the bottom?"
15,157,Lauren,Yeah.
15,158,Gretchen,"So I don't know what these people are -- maybe they have synaesthesia and that's how their synaesthesia works! And they were like, 'Finally! I could make this thing the way I like it!' That's my best guess. But I think one of the things when I think about being a ghost in a meat suit, meat skeleton, is that there's a certain amount of similarity that linguistics has to another hobby that I've been taking up in the recent couple years, which is stargazing."
15,159,Lauren,Yeah?
15,160,Gretchen,"And before I started stargazing, you know, I would go outside at night and I'd look up at the stars and be like, wow, there's stars, that's nice!"
15,161,Lauren,Yeah. They're there.
15,162,Gretchen,"They're there! Look, pretty! Sometimes there's a moon! And, you know, I knew one or two constellations, but if I couldn't find those, if Orion wasn't up, then I was just like, oh, there's stars. And now that I've been stargazing for over a year and I know what most of the constellations are and how they move through the sky at different hours of the day and different times of the year, and I have names associated with them, I go outside and I look at the same sky and what I see there is different. Because all of the individual pieces have meaning now and have associations with them and have patterns that I can see. And obviously the sky hasn't changed, I've changed. But in many cases, language is kind of like all those stars. We're surrounded by it all the time, you hear it all the time, you see it, it's there, but being able to look at language like a linguist looks at language is... now you have words, and you have frameworks that you can put in, here's what all these sounds are. And they're not just a bath of sounds, they're constellations. So you have this way of making sense of all of this stuff that you're seeing and you're experiencing it and putting it into some sort of context. I think for me that's one of the things that's really magical about linguistics. And stargazing! [Music]"

16,1,Gretchen,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics. I'm Gretchen McCulloch."
16,2,Lauren,"And I'm Lauren Gawne, and today we're looking at the smallest meaningful parts of language and how we learn them! But first: we had a great time at Winter/Summer Conference Fest 2017/18."
16,3,Gretchen,"That's a lot of slashes. We had so much fun seeing people in their Lingthusiasm International Phonetic Alphabet scarves and their other Lingthusiasm merch, and please keep sending in your pictures, we're gonna make a collage of everybody with Lingthusiasm stuff! And it was so fun to see you all in meat space. I was only at the LSA in Utah, Lauren was at both the LSA in Utah and the ALS, the Australian Linguistic Society, in -- where was it, Lauren?"
16,4,Lauren,"So, Gretchen and I got to hang out at the Linguistic Society of America annual conference in Salt Lake City in Utah along with a few thousand other linguists, and it was amazing! It was my first time I've ever been to an LSA, but before that in December I was at the Australian Linguistic Society conference -- hence the Winter/Summer 2017/2018 Conference Fest -- and it was so great to see everyone and to see so many people wearing IPA scarves, it just made me so happy. While I was at ALS I had the chance to chat with Daniel Midgley from Talk the Talk about the workshop we did on popularising linguistics, and that is going to be part of our Patreon bonus episode this month."
16,5,Gretchen,I am really excited to listen to that recording because I haven't heard it yet!
16,6,Lauren,"Great Patreon news 2018: we have full-length episodes for every bonus episode, so you are getting more bonus bang for your Patreon buck with those."
16,7,Gretchen,"Yeah! So, full episodes there. And you guys have been so amazing at supporting us on Patreon that we have to set some new goals. What a hardship. Just kidding, we're very excited. So we have set a new goal to commission some Lingthusiasm art! We're really excited that we get to support an artist and have some cool art of the show!"
16,8,Lauren,"I am really excited for this goal. That is a new $1,200 goal, we still have the live show to aspire to as well, and we are already plotting all kinds of other exciting future Patreon shenanigans."
16,9,Gretchen,"We bumped the live show up to $1,600 just because we want to have a bit more time to plan that and make it go really well, and we had a mini live show in September already, so we want to space out the live shows a bit, get the art in sooner because people have been so keen about the merch, we want to have more art-type options for that, and yeah, we're really excited! [Music]"
16,10,Gretchen,"So one big question in linguistics is how do babies learn words? And how do they learn the pieces of words and the way that we put words together to make them into longer sentences and compound words? And we talked a bit about how babies learn sounds back in a previous episode, but the word part, it has been a long-standing puzzle. And one of the options that people talked about, early in the days of figuring out how how babies learn words, is maybe they memorise them! Maybe they hear the adults say the words and they say, 'Aha! This must be a word that I'm trying to learn!' And so they just memorise them, kind of like whatever the adults come out with, the baby just learns."
16,11,Lauren,They are just a word vacuum!
16,12,Gretchen,"You know, it's just like a little -- you know those little penguins in the the Skinner boxes, like, you give them the stimuli and it presses the button, you press the button, you press the stimuli. Maybe babies just learn words like little penguins in boxes pressing buttons."
16,13,Lauren,Did you say the penguins in the Skinner machines?
16,14,Gretchen,"I meant pigeons, I meant pigeons. They are definitely pigeons. But you could probably do it with penguins, penguins are pretty smart! Okay, I'm just gonna keep going to take myself out of this."
16,15,Lauren,Okay.
16,16,Gretchen,"So maybe they're like the pigeons in the Skinner boxes. And one way to test this, to say, okay, are babies actually just learning words by memorising what their parents say, is you give them some novel words and you see what they do."
16,17,Lauren,"So we have a picture on the website, you can see it as I'm presenting this picture to Gretchen. And I'm presenting her with a thing she has never seen before and I say, 'Gretchen, this is called a wug.'"
16,18,Gretchen,Okay.
16,19,Lauren,"It's a cute, little, blue, boopy, bird-like thing. And I have this one wug here."
16,20,Gretchen,"We also have to pretend that I'm about three years old, just for perspective."
16,21,Lauren,"Yes, okay. And then if I present you with an illustration that has two of these little blue things, we have two...?"
16,22,Gretchen,Wugs?
16,23,Lauren,"You are as capable as a three-year-old, congratulations."
16,24,Gretchen,"Ahh, yay! Whoo!"
16,25,Lauren,You have passed what is known as the Wug Test.
16,26,Gretchen,"So, the Wug Test was a test that was created in, I think it was 1958, by Jean Berko Gleason, who was actually an undergrad at the time?"
16,27,Lauren,So amazing.
16,28,Gretchen,"Which kind of makes me feel inadequate about my entire life, my life choices."
16,29,Lauren,Yeah.
16,30,Gretchen,"So she was an undergrad in linguistics and psychology or something, and she created this Wug Test, and she created these drawings of these novel creatures that kids had never encountered before, and she elicited from the kids the plural forms of these words they'd never seen before. And the point of this is to point out, well, if I memorised -- I learned the word 'cat' from my parents, I could also learn the word 'cats' from my parents. We don't know that I haven't just memorised 'cat' and 'cats' and 'dog' and 'dogs' and so on."
16,31,Lauren,Like an overactive word vacuum!
16,32,Gretchen,"Like a word vacuum. But if you give me a word I've never seen before and I'm suddenly able to make the plural without anyone telling me what the plural is, using the same kind of patterns that are involved in other English plurals, then I must be doing something else. I must be generalising beyond just language in, language out."
16,33,Lauren,So we have something that looks like there are some rules there?
16,34,Gretchen,"Yeah, we have some rules there. And kids can look at the parts of the words, not just the whole words. And intuitively, this makes a lot of sense because kids also do this thing where they take a word that in English has an irregular plural or has an irregular past tense and they'll regularise it, they'll make it fit the patterns of the rest of the language. So kids will say things like 'taked' instead of 'took.'"
16,35,Lauren,Right.
16,36,Gretchen,Or 'sawed' or 'goed' instead of 'seen' or 'went.'
16,37,Lauren,"What's really great is you often get what's known as the regularisation curve, it's the fancy linguist term for it, where a child will say like, 'I ran' and you're like, 'Good boy, kid! You are doing the past tense great, you are so good!' And then they start saying 'I runned,' and it's because they've learnt that there is this rule that they should be applying and they over-apply it to all of them, including the irregular ones. And you're like, 'Oh no, I broke the kid, it was doing so well!' And then they eventually go back to figuring out the irregular forms, but there's this, like, it looks like a dip in their ability to speak, but it's actually a really important phase because they're figuring out what the rules are and they are applying them."
16,38,Gretchen,"Yeah! And so definitely kids do do some memorisation, like you can't just learn a bunch of words without memorising some stuff. But they're also trying to make the words into a system, and that's something that's really interesting. And in fact, what they're learning in things like the Wug Test is even more subtle than that. So I said, 'There's two wugs.' Lauren, if I gave you another drawing, let's say this is like a red, fluffy, ball o' thing animal."
16,39,Lauren,Yeah.
16,40,Gretchen,"And I say, 'This is a blick.'"
16,41,Lauren,Okay.
16,42,Gretchen,Now there are two of them.
16,43,Lauren,Yup.
16,44,Gretchen,There are two...?
16,45,Lauren,Blicks!
16,46,Gretchen,"Blicks! So we have two wugs, but two blicks."
16,47,Lauren,"Yep. So the kid has figured out that they have to add a thing to the word to make it plural, to make it more than one. So that's great."
16,48,Gretchen,And it's also figured out something else.
16,49,Lauren,"Yeah. But it's actually really hard to think about this because we do it all the time, but we're actually doing something super clever here. So I'm gonna say -- we're gonna go for super slow-mo action replay, and I'm gonna say blicks and wugs really slowly. So we have wugzzzzzz and we have blickssssss."
16,50,Gretchen,"But Lauren, why didn't we end up with wugssssss and blickzzzzzz? I can't even do that, that's really hard!"
16,51,Lauren,"It's really hard! And that's because even though we have this one thing that we think of as the plural /s/, the plural /s/ actually takes on a bunch of different costumes depending on who it's hanging out with. And so a /g/ in the wugs is what we call a voiced sound, so you've got that movement at the bottom of your throat. You're vibrating your vocal cords or vocal fold, and so you got a /g/, /g/, /g/, and that goes with a /z/. /gz/. And then for blicks, you've got this /k/, /k/, /k/, you don't have that vibration in your throat anymore. I still have to automatically put my hand to my throat when I talk about this, it's such an automatic reaction."
16,52,Gretchen,"I've got my hand on my throat right now and I think we should tell all the listeners, this is the play-along portion of the podcast. You need to put your hand on your throat."
16,53,Lauren,"It doesn't matter if you're on public transport, just put your hand on your throat."
16,54,Gretchen,"I don't care. I've been told some people have laughed out loud at this podcast before, if you can laugh out loud, you can /z/ out loud. Maybe not. You should do it anyway! Put your hand on your throat and make the /z/ sound."
16,55,Lauren,/z/ versus /s/.
16,56,Gretchen,/s/.
16,57,Lauren,And you can feel a difference. That's because the plural part has different shapes that it puts on depending on what it's near because then it's easier to say. Because we are nothing if not motivated by laziness.
16,58,Gretchen,It's efficiency! It's definitely efficiency.
16,59,Lauren,Yeah.
16,60,Gretchen,"And so, if you have a bit of a difficult time, you can also try saying 'blicks' and 'blickssz... blig...' Ugh, I can't even..."
16,61,Lauren,Blickzzz.
16,62,Gretchen,"Blickzzz. Because you might end up saying 'bligz,' which is fine. That's just as easy. Again, it's just everyone hanging out."
16,63,Gretchen,Yeah. And then try saying 'wugz' and 'wugsss'.
16,64,Lauren,Wugsss.
16,65,Gretchen,But not wuks! Wuks is different!
16,66,Lauren,"That's another fictional, non-existent creature."
16,67,Gretchen,"That's another -- that's wug's cousin. Um, yeah! So we do this thing, and we also do it with English words. So if you have a word like 'dogs,' you're gonna say it like 'wugs,' with the /z/ sound."
16,68,Lauren,"Compared to something like 'catsss'. So they're the two forms that we think of the most, but the plural actually has a third costume that it puts on sometimes in the context of a word like 'fox'. So if you think about the plural of 'fox,' you have one fox and two..."
16,69,Gretchen,Foxes?
16,70,Lauren,"Congratulations, Gretchen, good work."
16,71,Gretchen,"Yes, good. I don't know why I had a question intonation in my voice there, I know what the plural of 'fox' is."
16,72,Lauren,"Well, sometimes your linguist intuitions just get in the way."
16,73,Gretchen,"The problem is if you do this test on adults who are linguists, they'll be like, 'Oh, it's 'foxen.'' 'It's 'foxi.'' And you're like, 'No, no, really, I just want the kid answer.' Like, don't don't mess with me here."
16,74,Lauren,"Anyway, the point is even though we have the one thing that we think of as the bit that gets added to make a plural, it actually interacts with that sound system that we talked about in an earlier episode on child language to create these different forms."
16,75,Gretchen,"And we can see this if we do another variation on the Wug Test. So let's say I have -- I now have this purple, kind of doughy thing."
16,76,Lauren,Yep.
16,77,Gretchen,And this is a kazh. And now I've got two of them.
16,78,Lauren,Yep.
16,79,Gretchen,There are two...
16,80,Lauren,Kazhes.
16,81,Gretchen,Kazhes. So you definitely can't have two 'kazhs'.
16,82,Lauren,Kazhs.
16,83,Gretchen,'Cause that's...
16,84,Lauren,It's just too much to...
16,85,Gretchen,"No, it's..."
16,86,Lauren,You need that vowel in there to separate out the /ʒ/ from the /s/.
16,87,Gretchen,Just not a thing.
16,88,Lauren,Yeah.
16,89,Gretchen,"And Jean Berko Gleason is often cited as being, okay, well, she's the wug person. But she did this whole range of tests with people. And she had words like wug that end in a /g/ where you expect the kids to say /z/ for the plural, and words like blick that end in a /k/ where you expect the kids to say /s/ for the plural. And she also had words like kazh that end in a sound that's too close to a /s/ or a /z/ sound to just stick one on as a plural directly, and so you need that extra vowel. Kazhes. Fishes. Foxes."
16,90,Lauren,"So this isn't just learning words and their automatic plural, because kids have never seen these words when they do this test."
16,91,Gretchen,"Yeah, it's sensitivity to three different things about English plurals. And it turns out kids are pretty good at the wug/blick thing, and it takes them another, like, six months to a year or so to get the kazh thing."
16,92,Lauren,Right.
16,93,Gretchen,"So when they're really young, they'll say 'wugs' right and then they'll just say 'kazh' as if it's also the plural form. And then a year later you bring them in again, or you bring in slightly older kids, and they've got it. They've figured out this extra one. But it does take them a little bit longer. So you can watch this acquisition happening in real time."
16,94,Lauren,"You don't just get, like, magic fwoosh! you know all about the plural now, go forth and pluralise. It's an additive process."
16,95,Gretchen,"Yeah, it really happens in stages."
16,96,Lauren,"Have you ever run a Wug Test? Because I -- I mean, I teach this all the time, but I've never run an experiment using it."
16,97,Gretchen,"I did, actually! So, I was a research assistant the summer between my second and third years of university, and I had taken a class with this prof who was a developmental psycholinguistics -- actually in the psychology department, but the linguistics department was pretty small, so I was like, 'Oh, this is a good class, let me just approach this prof and say 'Hi, could you use a research assistant for the summer and you'd like to pay me for it maybe? Okay! What can I work on?'' And so we applied for this grant and I got this summer research grant to work on this project. And we were trying to do a modified Wug Test thing where we were trying to figure out how to teach kids irregular plurals?"
16,98,Lauren,Right.
16,99,Gretchen,"So if you have, like, 'foot/""feet,' like, can I teach them 'koot/keet' or something like this? And so, spoiler alert, it didn't work."
16,100,Lauren,"Huh, interesting."
16,101,Gretchen,"And I'm not sure why didn't work, it could have been we messed up, it could have been the words were too hard, we could have -- maybe we had to give them more exposures, 'cause maybe you have to be exposed to an irregular plural, like, four or five times, or twenty times."
16,102,Lauren,"So, it's one of those things I think it's worth pointing out that sometimes a failure just gives you an idea of how you might have gone wrong and that provides some insight as well."
16,103,Gretchen,"Yeah, so there's twenty different ways that we might have gone wrong, and I don't know what they are, and maybe it's just not possible! Like, we know kids learn irregulars somehow. But anyway, yeah, so we just don't know. But it was a fun summer, I got to go to the dollar store and buy a bunch of toys, because instead of doing drawings we did actual toys."
16,104,Lauren,"I love experiment crafting, it's so much fun."
16,105,Gretchen,"It's so much fun. So I went to the dollar store, I bought a bunch of cheap toys, and then I took them apart and put them back together to make Frankentoys."
16,106,Lauren,So they were things the kids had never seen before!
16,107,Gretchen,"'Cause they had to be things the kids had never seen before! And the Ethics Board -- so we had to fill in an ethics application -- they were very concerned that we not do it with objects the kids might have seen because they didn't want us to confuse the kids by teaching them the wrong words for things, because that's not ethical."
16,108,Lauren,"Right, okay."
16,109,Gretchen,"'Cause sometimes, yeah, people do these experiments and show the kids a garlic press and it's like, 'Oh, kids probably don't know what a garlic press is, we'll just give it a weird name.' But we were like, no, we have to make unique toys. Anyway. So it didn't work. It was a very interesting summer."
16,110,Lauren,"But in the way we can pull apart small animals and toys to make other animals and toys, we can pull apart words. Like, we often think of words as these individual units of meaning that have a particular importance, but words have meaningful bits within them."
16,111,Gretchen,"Exactly. And the field of linguistics that looks at, you know, what are the meaningful bits of words and what's the smallest correspondence that we can have between a sound and a meaning?"
16,112,Lauren,Yeah.
16,113,Gretchen,"Because some words are really long and they have lots of individual parts of them that have individual meanings that get added to them, you know, 'cats' has two parts of meaning to it, it has the 'cat' part and it has /s/ at the end that's adding this plural meaning. And so linguists talk about morphemes as these individual units of meaning -- combined meaning and sound. So a 'cat' is a word that's a single morpheme, 'cats' is a word that has two morphemes."
16,114,Lauren,Yeah.
16,115,Gretchen,"And you can get up to, like, very, very long words that have lots of morphemes."
16,116,Lauren,Yeah. And different languages have different preferences for how many morphemes that they have.
16,117,Gretchen,"Yeah, so you can get some of these, like, fake English examples like 'antidisestablishmentarianism' have a lot of morphemes in English, these kinds of fun words."
16,118,Lauren,Yep.
16,119,Gretchen,So one language that's well-known for having very long words is Turkish.
16,120,Lauren,Uh-huh.
16,121,Gretchen,"Which has lots of different inflectional things that you can add on to words and just kind of string them together, some of which have been translated into a full sentence. Turkish is one that I can vouch for because I had an Intro Linguistics prof who was Turkish and she used to give us this example, so I believe her and I think it's real. I tried to verify it on the internet, but you know. And this is a long word that means 'are you one of those people who we could not make to be European' or 'we could not Europeanise'."
16,122,Lauren,"So here you're getting the kind of meaning that takes a whole English sentence and many words, all fitting together using parts of a single word."
16,123,Gretchen,"Right, so you have one part that makes it a question, you have one part that means 'one of,' you have one part that means 'not,' you have one part that means 'could,' and the example that I found -- the equivalent that I found of it on the internet is 'are you one of those people who we could not make to be Czechoslovakian,' which I think is probably just because 'Czechoslovakian' is very long, so it probably beats --"
16,124,Lauren,So it looks more impressive.
16,125,Gretchen,"It looks very impressive! I think 'European' is also fairly long but not quite as long as 'Czechoslovakian,' so someone really went for the... but it has the same number of morphemes, probably."
16,126,Lauren,"The word that I learnt in my -- because people always like to have one example in their Intro to Linguistics courses, and, you know, I'm in Australia, and Australian languages are really well-known for having lots of really rich affixing to words, so you have a word that is the sentence. And so the one I had is from a language called Binij Gunwok or Mayali, and it translates as 'I cooked the wrong meat for them again.' So again, something that takes a whole sentence in English to say can be said in just one word that has lots of these affixes."
16,127,Gretchen,"Yeah. So, prefixes and suffixes are all kinds of morphemes, but an individual word itself that has nothing else onto it is also a morpheme. And sometimes it's hard, like, something that's a prefix or a suffix in one language might just be an individual short word in another."
16,128,Lauren,Yeah.
16,129,Gretchen,"But both of those are morphemes. So it's useful to have a cover term for this entire category that doesn't commit to whether a language treats something like negation 'not' as an added morpheme or as a separate word, you know, like, English has both. We can say 'not' as a separate word, we can say '-n't' as in 'didn't,' which is kind of a suffix? Kind of a word? Or we can treat it as an affix, you can say something like 'un' at the beginning of a word and that's that's negation as an affix. So there's lots of different ways of expressing that, and there's ways of doing that. And one of the fun rites of passage in doing Intro Linguistics is the morphology problem set."
16,130,Lauren,"I love morphology. Morphology problems to me, like, they're like Sudoku for linguists."
16,131,Gretchen,They so much are.
16,132,Lauren,"Like, I find them so soothing and I get to crack out all my coloured pens. We have an example that we'll link to in the show notes to an International Linguistics Olympiad problem from 2003 on a language called Adyghe, and you can just see looking at it, immediately -- there's seven sentences, and each sentence has three words in Adyghe and five, six, seven words in the English translation, and you just, like, instantly, your little linguist spider senses kind of go, 'Ooh, that means each of those words has more units that have meaning in them and more meaningful different bits than the English ones do and I am gonna figure out what they are!'"
16,133,Gretchen,"Yeah, and so you're looking at the sentence, saying, 'Okay, so what do the English ones have in common and what's there in the Adyghe versions and what's...' You know, it's so much fun. I enjoy them so much. This is one of the things that, like, if you think you want to become a linguist, you can go hit up the International Linguistics Olympiad and check out some of their problems sets because they do a lot that are kind of this logic, language-based morphology problems that are a lot of fun. And I was very disappointed to learn in in real life, when you're actually dealing with a language that's more, you know, in a more naturalistic setting and you're not just given the language on the page, it gets a lot more complicated very quickly."
16,134,Lauren,Yep.
16,135,Gretchen,"Eh, not disappointed, but it's disappointing and exciting at the same time because you're like, well, I figured out that this thing must be a morpheme, but what I haven't figured out is exactly what it means, because it seems to mean this thing in this circumstance and this thing in this other circumstance and this thing over here... Or, I figured out that there's something going on here, but I'm not sure if it's actually two morphemes, or if it's three morphemes, or if it's just one... Or, like, both of these words end in /s/, but are they both the same /s/ morpheme? Because there's lots of words in English that end in /s/ that aren't plural!"
16,136,Lauren,"Yep. Some of them are the verb form for third-person singular, so, 'he eats,' 'she runs.'"
16,137,Gretchen,"Yeah! So, like, those are two different /s/'s. Those are two different morphemes in English."
16,138,Lauren,Yeah.
16,139,Gretchen,"There's a plural morpheme and there's a third person singular morpheme and those aren't the same thing. But if you were approaching English from this perspective of oh, we got to figure it out, you probably spend some time being like, well, hmm, maybe there's something that they have in common, maybe they're historically related! Do we think these are the same?"
16,140,Lauren,These are indeed the kind of thoughts that we tend to go on.
16,141,Gretchen,"Yeah, morphology problem sets are kind of like the spherical cows of linguistics. Like, in physics you get to assume that there's no friction, and gravity is always at this speed, and the wind isn't blowing, and like, ah, the cow just falls -- it's approximately a sphere shape. And so they're this fun abstraction to look at, but they're also just a very beginning taste of the complexity that's actually there in a language."
16,142,Lauren,"Yep, and it is a set that someone has deliberately set out for you, so they know exactly how challenging it is and that it can be solved in some way. And then you get to real language and you're like, oh, it's a lot more complicated when people actually use it! But I feel like when I started linguistics I had this idea that there were words that had meaning and that's your semantics taken care of, you have the order the words are put in and that's syntax, and words are made up of particular sounds or hand shapes and that's your phonetics or your articulatory stuff taken care of, and I don't really think, like, morphology is kind of the quiet middle child of linguistics?"
16,143,Gretchen,"Yeah, sometimes it kind of gets lost between phonology and syntax. I mean, some people will say that syntax and morphology are really just kind of different sides of the same coin because a lot of things that are a single word in one language are a prefix or suffix in another language, and so if we primarily look at morphology when it's stuff glommed on to other stuff then we end up ignoring the languages where you can't separate them out."
16,144,Lauren,"But as we've seen with the ways that you have the different plural morphemes, there is something different that morphology is doing there, at least."
16,145,Gretchen,"So, one quote about that is, 'Today's morphology is yesterday's syntax -- or -- Today's syntax is yesterday's morphology.' And this is a quote by Tom Givón that gets kind of quoted in linguistics, but it comes in this idea from a linguist named R.M.W. Dixon, and he talks about languages evolving in a cycle from having a lot of individual words to kind of glomming those words onto each other a little bit to having these long words with lots of bits glommed on, and then keep going around. So you can put languages with lots of bits glommed on at twelve o'clock on a clock, you can put the languages with lots of individual words at four o'clock, and you can put the languages where the individual bits have started to stick together again at eight o'clock. So he says that Old Chinese was around three o'clock -- mostly individual words with some little bits of fusion -- and modern varieties are at five o'clock instead, so now they're heading towards glomming on in the other direction."
16,146,Lauren,"I would love if this was just the default way of talking about morphology. It's like, yeah, I'm working on an eleven o'clock language, it's pretty exciting."
16,147,Gretchen,"It's kind of interesting to see in English, because -- so, Old English has lots of words with lots of endings and stuff, so it would probably -- it would be up at twelve o'clock."
16,148,Lauren,Yeah.
16,149,Gretchen,"And then English starts losing most of those endings, like, it loses a lot of endings, it loses a lot of these inflections. We're left with just, like, instead of having different endings for 'I go' and 'you go' and 'he or she goes' and so on, there's just this one left that goes. So English has lost most of those, but now we're getting more added on because you have stuff like '-n't' as in 'didn't' or 'won't', and that used to be a separate word and now it's glomming on instead."
16,150,Lauren,Yeah.
16,151,Gretchen,"Or you have the '-a' as in 'coulda, woulda, shoulda.' That was a separate word and now it's glommed on in informal speech."
16,152,Lauren,So we're moving around the clock once more.
16,153,Gretchen,"I think we're like at six o'clock now, I think we're moving back around the other direction!"
16,154,Lauren,"And we do kind of -- we don't make new morphemes as often as we make new words, but it is something that we can do in a language. So, I have a friend who likes to track a few of them and she sent me a little while ago down '-spiration' rabbit hole. So, 'inspiration,' that the meaning behind 'inspiration' gets captured by the '-spiration' suffix that you can add to things like 'lingspiration' is when you're inspired by something in linguistics!"
16,155,Gretchen,"Oh, we could have called the podcast that, Lauren!"
16,156,Lauren,"We could've, it would've been really great. Well, I mean '-thusiasm' is not a bad candidate for a new productive morpheme."
16,157,Gretchen,"'-thusiasm' is kind of one! Yeah, that's not bad. I mean, 'ling' is definitely there in the names of a lot of linguistics stuff."
16,158,Lauren,Yes.
16,159,Gretchen,I know an undergraduate linguistics society that calls themselves the UnderLings.
16,160,Lauren,"Oh, that's great. I like that."
16,161,Gretchen,"It's pretty cute. Yeah, and you get stuff like '-oholic,' which starts out as 'alcoholic' and becomes stuff like 'shopaholic' and 'chocoholic.'"
16,162,Lauren,Yeah.
16,163,Gretchen,And these kinds of things.
16,164,Lauren,"You also have -- sometimes morphemes break free, and it makes me so happy when they do this. One thing -- I know you've talked about in an old blog post and I think I've written about it for the Big Issue as well -- is the liberation of 'ish.' So 'ish' is a really, like, it's a good, robust Germanic suffix that used to just refer to people of a particular place like English or Danish and then came to refer to an attribute of something --"
16,165,Gretchen,"So now you get, like, bluish and tallish."
16,166,Lauren,"Yeah. And now you can kind of say, you know, 'Does that taste good?' And you're gonna be like, 'Eh, ish?' And it kind of is like an approximate, like, 'Oh, kind of.'"
16,167,Gretchen,"Yeah. 'Hungry?' 'Yeah, ish.'"
16,168,Lauren,Completely tangential but still great '-ish' fact: it is cousins with the French '-esque'!
16,169,Gretchen,"Oh, is it?"
16,170,Lauren,"Yeah, French borrowed -- so you can borrow morphemes across languages in the way you can borrow words, it doesn't happen as often."
16,171,Gretchen,"Well, English borrowed '-esque' from French, for that matter."
16,172,Lauren,"Yes, so we borrowed '-esque,' but it was -- the French borrowed it from Germanic languages a bit earlier and then used it in their own way, so."
16,173,Gretchen,Huh.
16,174,Lauren,You can do a lot of things with morphemes that you can do with words like borrow them and have them change over time.
16,175,Gretchen,"Yeah, and in some sense, like, in languages with a written tradition, 'is there spaces between it' is kind of the definition of a word, but the question of 'should there be spaces here' is still an open question for at least certain members of the vocabulary. So questions like 'should you close something up,' you know, like initial -- just because I've been doing a lot of researching about the early internet these days, people were writing 'web site' with a space between it for a while, and now --"
16,176,Lauren,Aww.
16,177,Gretchen,I know! So cute! And now people pretty standardly write 'website.'
16,178,Lauren,Come visit my web site!
16,179,Gretchen,"Yeah, yeah."
16,180,Lauren,It's the site that I have on the web!
16,181,Gretchen,My web page is on my web site! My web mail!
16,182,Lauren,So you can see how things like intonation are really important here for spoken language rather than written language.
16,183,Gretchen,"The intonation comes first, obviously people were saying 'website' before they started dropping the space as much. So, speaking of new words, wugs are actually kind of useless as a fake word now because they've become such a recognised category in linguistics. Like, because they're so very cute -- and if you haven't seen a picture of a wug, you should definitely look one up, it's spelled w-u-g -- because they're so cute and they're so friendly-looking, they've become kind of a mascot of linguistics. And so --"
16,184,Lauren,They are definitely a linguist meme.
16,185,Gretchen,"They're definitely a linguist meme. So you get people -- I keep a whole file on the blog just of fun stuff people have done with wugs. There are knitted wugs, there are crocheted wugs, there are wug cookies, there are wugs on mugs, which I think is particularly great."
16,186,Lauren,That is very good.
16,187,Gretchen,"There are -- the University of Edinburgh undergraduate linguistic society, I met some of their members last year, the year before, when I went to visit them, and they have full, human-sized wug costumes."
16,188,Lauren,"What? No! Oh my gosh, yes! And they did that wug battle!"
16,189,Gretchen,"Yes, and they have a video of them wearing the wug costumes, and the wugs, the two wugs, the people in the wug costumes, like, fake battling each other, and --"
16,190,Lauren,"Here is a wug, here are two wugs."
16,191,Gretchen,"The students told me that they wear them for recruitment? Like, they have a little booth when the students are arriving and they say, 'Come join our society, we're really friendly and also we're wearing these giant, ridiculous costumes!'"
16,192,Lauren,"That is so great. We have all the usual related links for the episode and then we have a whole different subsection of wug links for your amusement, or just check out Gretchen's wugs tag on All Things Linguistic."
16,193,Gretchen,"I really enjoy collecting all of the possible wugs. People have made wug tattoos... I'm in a linguistics meme group on Facebook and every couple days somebody will post like, 'Can someone explain to me this wug meme because I missed it?' And people have to be like, 'No, no, no, it's not actually a meme, it's this linguistics thing. Here you go.'"
16,194,Lauren,So this has been your introduction to morphology and the very important linguist wug meme.
16,195,Gretchen,"Pop culture references. Yeah, so you've had an important theoretical concept and also the most important linguistics meme. [Music]"

17,4,Gretchen,And thanks so much to everybody who's doing that already. [Music]
17,5,Gretchen,So. Vowels.
17,6,Lauren,"Human voices are amazing. Like, the fact that we communicate by speech is this amazing process that's basically that humans are giant meat tubes, and we make air go through those tubes to make sounds. But that's disgusting, and that's why we call it phonetics instead of meat tubes."
17,7,Gretchen,Meat tube science?
17,8,Lauren,"The science of meat tubes and air! So, we kind of push air through, and then we have different parts of our vocal tract, so our -- what we think of as voice box and our mouth, and all the things in our mouth, to kind of change --"
17,9,Gretchen,And especially our tongue!
17,10,Lauren,"-- especially our tongue! -- changes the way the air flows, and that changes the quality of the sound. And so all of this that we're saying now is based on that outflow of air, but it's how we stop and change and shape the air that makes different sounds!"
17,11,Gretchen,"So, you have a mouth. You're listening to this, you've got a mouth. You've got a tongue in it. That's kind of weird. Your tongue has a certain amount of space that it can move within your mouth. So, you start from behind your teeth -- your tongue can be kind of up there."
17,12,Lauren,"Nnn... if you are not pulling funny faces to yourself on the train, you're not doing this right."
17,13,Gretchen,"I'm pulling funny faces right now, I can't even talk 'cause I'm trying to act it out! You can go down a bit, so you can go down below your lower teeth."
17,14,Lauren,[mumbled] Has a really great effect.
17,15,Gretchen,"You can go back -- go back in the kind of, like, dentist move, like, 'Open your mouth as wide as you can and say aaaah!'"
17,16,Lauren,Aaaah!
17,17,Gretchen,"Aaaah! And then you can go kind of back up as far -- like, to the top of the roof of your mouth at the back -- and [garbled] and you have it up here. You know, maybe you can hear me sounding kind of weird, that's 'cause I'm trying to act it out. You should act it out! You're sitting here anyway, you've got the time, what else are you doing with it? Don't answer that."
17,18,Lauren,"Just let a big -- especially if you're in public, just let a big bunch of air go and go, 'Eeeaaaaayyooooauuugh.' Kind of. Move that tongue around."
17,19,Gretchen,"Eeeaaaauuuooo. And you can go backwards, too, you can go, 'Aaaeeeeiiii.'"
17,20,Lauren,Hours of fun.
17,21,Gretchen,"Hours of fun! What's cool about this is that the vowels -- we think about them as distinct, like there's this vowel and there's that vowel, there's /i/ and there's /a/, but they're on a continuum. And when you drop your jaw in a vowel position, you can sliiiide down from one vowel to the next. Or you can slide back up when you raise your jaw again."
17,22,Lauren,Eeeaaaaaiiiieeee.
17,23,Gretchen,Or ooooouuuaaaaaa.
17,24,Lauren,That was a good one.
17,25,Gretchen,"Yeah! Yeah, that was a different one. So you can do 'aaaoooouuuu.' And you can also slide front and back, so you can go 'iiiieeeeeaaaa.'"
17,26,Lauren,Iiiiieeeeeaaaa? It sounds like I'm asking a question.
17,27,Gretchen,Or 'ooooeeeeeuuuu.'
17,28,Lauren,Okay. So we can move all around in that space.
17,29,Gretchen,"And when linguists talk about this space, we talk about vowels as existing in a trapezoid, which, in case you've forgotten your grade-school geometry, a trapezoid is kind of like a square, right, but the top bits are more pushed out so it looks like either a triangle that's been chopped off, or a square that's been stretched on one side."
17,30,Lauren,Yep.
17,31,Gretchen,"And the top bit of the trapezoid, the part that represents the roof your mouth, is wider and has more stuff potentially going on in it because you have more space in the roof of your mouth than you do on the bottom part of your jaw."
17,32,Lauren,We will make sure that there's a picture that has one of these abstracted trapezoids overlaid on an actual face so you can kind of get an idea what we're getting at here.
17,33,Gretchen,"Yeah, so definitely check out the show notes to make sure you get the picture. But there is an abstract picture, and you can visualise it in your mouth in three-dimensional space. It doesn't really matter it's really mostly two-dimensional, because there's not much of a difference in terms of what you do on the left side of your mouth or the right side of your mouth, you're going to produce the same vowels. That's not something that languages do, that people do."
17,34,Lauren,We're nice and symmetrical when it comes to that part.
17,35,Gretchen,"Yeah. There's also this very, very cool website which is called Pink Trombone."
17,36,Lauren,"I guess because like that slide -- I mean, we were doing basically trombone impersonations, you kind of sliiide between things."
17,37,Gretchen,And it'll give you a model vocal tract and you can slide the tongue around and you can listen to it make the vowels as you slide the tongue into different positions.
17,38,Lauren,You can play the old meat tube.
17,39,Gretchen,"But you also possess your own and you can play around with it, and pay attention to what your tongue is doing, because normally, like, we figure all this stuff out when we're babies. Like, you don't think about it, you've forgotten it. And so you can think about, like, what's your tongue doing? If you leave this episode and you --"
17,40,Lauren,"If you leave this episode without thinking about how disgusting tongues are, you've done very, very well."
17,41,Gretchen,Yep.
17,42,Lauren,Congratulations.
17,43,Gretchen,"Uh, no, you've done poorly, you should be thinking about how weird tongues are! So what's cool about this trapezoid and the fact that vowels are points on a continuum rather then discrete objects -- you know, there's a big difference between /p/ and /t/ because you have to put your lips and your tongue in very different positions for those. But the difference between /i/ and /e/ is really more a question of degree rather than kind. It's all part of this kind of nebulous vowel space."
17,44,Lauren,"Yeah, consonants are often -- not always, but often -- a lot more locked-in, you're either one or the other."
17,45,Gretchen,"Whereas vowels go all over the place! And they are so weird! And cool. And if you want to practice getting a sense of just how weird your tongue is, one of my favourite things to do with students, which I stole from, I think, the linguist Jessi Grieser on Facebook -- hi Jessi, if you're listening! -- is to get students to put a lollipop on your tongue, kind of on the back part of your tongue, and make a bunch of vowels. And you can feel the lollipop moving and the stick coming out, and you're like, 'Oh, the stick is moving forward and backwards!' And so you can see where it's going and see how it moves."
17,46,Lauren,That is tastier than every other way of gaining phonetic data that I know about.
17,47,Gretchen,"So, if you're very, very lucky and you're enrolled in an Intro Linguistics class, maybe one day you'll get a lollipop and get to play around with vowels with it."
17,48,Lauren,"Take your own! Like, 'I'm here in Intro to Phonetics!'"
17,49,Gretchen,"DIY the lollipop. When I first heard about this I was like, 'Well, I'm at home, I don't have any lollipops, what am I going to do?' So I ended up getting a gummy candy and sticking a toothpick in it? It worked okay!"
17,50,Lauren,That's good fieldwork improvisation.
17,51,Gretchen,"Yeah, at first I tried it with a toothbrush, but the toothbrush was too heavy and it kept falling out of my mouth."
17,52,Lauren,Mmm.
17,53,Gretchen,"And it didn't stick 'cause it wasn't, you know, candy enough."
17,54,Lauren,It's fuzzy and not made of sugar.
17,55,Gretchen,Then I got a toothpick and a gummy bear and it worked okay.
17,56,Lauren,So you got a sense of where in your mouth your tongue was as you were doing the different vowels.
17,57,Gretchen,"Yeah, because it's so unconscious to us, we have to think about the content of what we're saying, we don't often get to drill down and think about the vowels."
17,58,Lauren,"Yeah. I mean, it's unconscious, but we have this really strong sense of it, because it's vowels that are usually driving the difference between accents."
17,59,Gretchen,Mm!
17,60,Lauren,"You know, both of us have a 'P', and we say /p/ more or less the same, and we have an 'M' and we say /m/ more or less the same. But it's our vowels that are really, really different. Well, not really, really different, but more different."
17,61,Gretchen,"Yeah, and so when you're hearing a difference in an accent in somebody, or a different variety of English, you're often hearing a thing that they're doing differently for their vowels. So sometimes you get -- especially thinking of the vowel situation as a space is what explains why some sounds become other sounds in particular accents. So there are some varieties of English that have that have what's known as the pin/pen merger."
17,62,Lauren,Yeah.
17,63,Gretchen,"So in these varieties you have people say, like, 'a sewing pin' and 'a writing pin' because those are the same sound to them."
17,64,Lauren,Yep.
17,65,Gretchen,"And the reason that that's possible is because /ɪ/ and /ɛ/, the sounds in 'pin' and 'pen,' they're neighbours in the vowel space."
17,66,Lauren,"Yeah. Well, they're neighbours for us, but they live in the same share house for people with that merger."
17,67,Gretchen,"Yeah, exactly! And so because they're neighbours they can also become roommates! They can become -- they can glom on to each other and people can say, 'Okay, this is actually just one space for me.'"
17,68,Lauren,Yeah.
17,69,Gretchen,And it's all this sound that's kind of halfway between the two.
17,70,Lauren,"Or, for example, other people might move them further apart."
17,71,Gretchen,Yeah.
17,72,Lauren,"So, I have generally pretty high vowels? So my /ai/, /i/ vowels are generally higher than yours are."
17,73,Gretchen,"Huh. Okay, say an example of that. So I have 'me,' and you have...?"
17,74,Lauren,So I say 'me.'
17,75,Gretchen,"Me. Me. Yeah, I think that is higher in my mouth than -- me? Me. Hm. Okay. /i/ You can have lots of fun with your friends and trying to say lots of vowels like this. And so the reason why the pin/pen merger is possible -- so you don't get, for example, the pin/pan merger."
17,76,Lauren,Yeah.
17,77,Gretchen,"That's not going to happen anywhere, because '-an' is pronounced way at the back of the mouth, it's a lot like your dentist 'aaaah'. 'Paaan.' And 'pin' is all the way at the front of the mouth and higher against the roof the mouth. So if you have a low back vowel and high front vowel, a lot has to happen in order for them to glom on to each other."
17,78,Lauren,Yep.
17,79,Gretchen,"But if you have two vowels and one is high front and the other one is kind of mid front, then they're pretty close to each other and so it's easy for them to take on the same space. Like, 'pin' and 'pen' do that."
17,80,Lauren,"It's actually impressive that we can all speak with slightly different -- our vowels existing in slightly different points on the vowel space and we can all accommodate that. It's a really impressive cognitive feat, not only that different people can produce different accents with different vowels, but then people who don't speak that accent, with only generally a little bit of exposure, can kind of figure out what's happening and regularise it in their brain."
17,81,Gretchen,"Yeah, 'cause it's kind of interesting that we only notice it when something goes wrong? So, if you're saying a word in context where the word is mostly predictable from context and you're hearing what everybody else's vowels are, and what all the other vowels in all the other words are doing, then a word -- even with quite a different vowel from how you might say it -- is still pretty comprehensible because you're shifting your whole representation of a vowel space in, you know, seconds to accommodate someone else that you're listening to. And then the only time it goes wrong is when you have a word that you just don't have any context for. So this happened to me with New Zealand English, because I was watching Flight of the Conchords."
17,82,Lauren,Which is a fabulous show and has some really great New Zealand accents.
17,83,Gretchen,"Yes. And one of the guys, one of the Conchords, is named Brett, what I would call Brett."
17,84,Lauren,Yep.
17,85,Gretchen,"But of course anything goes with names! Like, anything can be a name, you don't necessarily know how someone's name is going to be spelled just from how they say it and so on."
17,86,Lauren,Uh-huh.
17,87,Gretchen,"And so when he was introducing himself on a show, he'd be like, 'My name is [brɪt].' And I was like, your name's what? I don't... I don't have that vowel? Like, surely it maps onto one of my vowels, but I don't know which one!"
17,88,Lauren,What did you decide it was?
17,89,Gretchen,"I had to look it up! Like, I didn't -- I was like, 'Brit like Britney?!' But this guy seems very dudely and I think of that as a woman's name, but maybe it's not? You know, maybe his name is Brit?"
17,90,Lauren,Yeah.
17,91,Gretchen,"But nobody else seems surprised about this, so I was like maybe it's not Brit? Like..."
17,92,Lauren,"But after watching the show for long enough, do you think if you then came across them introducing a new character whose name was [dɪb] would you think..."
17,93,Gretchen,"Oh, then I'd be like, 'Oh, maybe that's Deb.'"
17,94,Lauren,"Yeah, so you would kind of normalise it. You know who's really bad at figuring out vowels across different accents?"
17,95,Gretchen,Who's that?
17,96,Lauren,Computers!
17,97,Gretchen,"Oh, what's that!"
17,98,Lauren,"We do it so intuitively and without thinking -- and it's hard when you come across a new accent that you can learn to accommodate it -- that we often forget that speech recognition really, really struggles with this."
17,99,Gretchen,"It really, really does. Yeah. And so, I don't know, I haven't tried to play a Flight of the Conchords excerpt for Google Assistant or Alexa or Siri or one of these to see how they manage it, but it's probably bad."
17,100,Lauren,It's quite possible they would try and call your friend Britney if you asked it to call 'Brit.'
17,101,Gretchen,"Ah, yeah, that would be a problem. So, when we create the transcripts for the show, we run the transcripts through YouTube's auto- captioning feature first of all, and then we get a human to fix them because they always need a lot of fixing, but at least it makes it faster. And the YouTube auto-transcriber does have a lot of difficulty with your surname, Lauren! Do you want to say your surname again for us?"
17,102,Lauren,"Hi, I'm Lauren Gawne. Which is different from the past tense verb 'gone.' So, 'I've gone to see Lauren Gawne,' they're two different vowels for me."
17,103,Gretchen,"So is that the same difference that you have between 'cot' and 'caught,' like a bed and the past tense of 'catch'?"
17,104,Lauren,Yes. So: 'I caught a cold' and 'I bought a cot.'
17,105,Gretchen,"Right! So, when I met Lauren, I was like, 'So you have this distinction between the past tense of go and your surname, but I don't think I make this distinction in any other words, because...'"
17,106,Lauren,So 'caught' and 'cot' are housemates in your vowel space.
17,107,Gretchen,"Yeah, they're just joined at the hip, they're the same thing. So, because they're already the same vowel for me, I was like, I don't think I can reconfigure my vowel space, what I need is how can I map your name onto my vowel space, because I'm not going to acquire an Australian accent just so I can say your name."
17,108,Lauren,"So, like, the lengths you don't go to. So, how would you introduce me to someone?"
17,109,Gretchen,"So I would say, 'This is Lauren [Gone].'"
17,110,Lauren,Yeah.
17,111,Gretchen,"You know, because that's the accommodation. I said, 'Is it okay if I pronounce your name as the past tense of go, because I don't think I have the vowel that you actually use.'"
17,112,Lauren,"And of course because we're linguists, that was actually how the conversation went."
17,113,Gretchen,"Oh, yeah, that's literally what I said!"
17,114,Lauren,But people just make these accommodations all the time.
17,115,Gretchen,"Yeah. And one of the things that I think is cool is, you know, vowels can glom on to each other or they can get further apart, become estranged, but this often happens at a level that's not just one individual set of neighbours. Like, if we have a bunch of neighbours and I move into your room and then you're like, 'Excuse me, I was occupying this room, you move into the room down the hall, the next one.' And then that person's like, 'Hi, sorry, I was here!'"
17,116,Lauren,"'I'm sorry, this is my room.'"
17,117,Gretchen,"And so I'm gonna occupy this next one. And then eventually we get all the way to the end of the hallway and that person's like, 'Excuse me,' and so they go back around to the front of the hall and they're like, 'Oh, this room seems empty, I guess I'll take it.'"
17,118,Lauren,It's like a giant square dance.
17,119,Gretchen,"Yeah, yeah! Square dancing, that's a good example. I was trying to think of an analogy before this and I was like, 'Dominoes?'"
17,120,Lauren,"Sometimes you'll expect someone to go into the room on the left and they're like, 'I'm going to go see if anyone's in this room on the right. Oh, hi, like, you have to get out now.' So these mergers and stuff don't occur in isolation. Once one part of the vowel space starts to move, everyone has to start moving to kind of fit in with that. And we've seen it happen many, many -- the reason that we have the diversity in accents that we have in English is because this shift has happened several times throughout history and several times in different places, and it's happening right now in some places, which is super exciting!"
17,121,Gretchen,"Yeah, it is! So, the first time that I went to LA and the friend that I was visiting said, 'Something you have to understand about Los Angeles is everyone talks about the traffic instead of the weather, 'cause the weather is always nice, and so our small talk conversation is about how the bad the traffic is instead.' And I was like, 'Sounds weird, but okay.' And she said, 'No, no, you really have to understand how important it is, there is this whole sketch on Saturday Night Live about people talking about the traffic in California.' And I was like, 'I have not seen this!' And so she dragged me over to the computer and she pulled up YouTube and she's like, 'You need to watch this sketch.'"
17,122,Lauren,This is your social induction into LA.
17,123,Gretchen,"This is my social induction into LA culture. And so I watched this sketch and I was like, 'Ok yes, they are talking about the traffic, but what really interests me about this sketch is the vowels.'"
17,124,Lauren,Of course it did.
17,125,Gretchen,"I drew her a vowel diagram, I was like, 'This is what they're doing!'"
17,126,Lauren,"You're a good friend, Gretchen."
17,127,Gretchen,"And she was like, 'Oh, I think I kind of finally understand what it is you do with linguistics!'"
17,128,Lauren,So what is happening with Californian vowels? Can you give us a few examples?
17,129,Gretchen,"Yeah. So you get these people with, you know, their spray tans and so on, and they come in and -- there's one line in a clip that I looked up before this, I'll link to a clip if you want to watch a whole longer thing -- but the character says something like, 'This femily reunion's gonna be hyuge.' 'Have you cut the cucumbers for the dep yet?' And there's a couple key words in that. There's 'femily' for 'family.' 'Femily reunion's gonna be hyuge.' And this 'hyuge' which is for 'huge.'"
17,130,Lauren,Yeah.
17,131,Gretchen,And there is 'dep' for 'dip.' 'Dep' for 'dip.'
17,132,Lauren,'Get the dep.'
17,133,Gretchen,"And what's really interesting is there is a vowel shift that's going on in California right now -- it's also happening in Canada, actually, it's like the Canada/California shift?"
17,134,Lauren,Cool.
17,135,Gretchen,"Yeah! And it's pushing a bunch of vowels in a particular direction. So it is making the /ɪ/ vowel in 'dip' a little bit further down, like /ɪ/ to /ɛ/. And what this skit does, is it says, 'We're not just going to take /ɪ/ to /ɛ/ like normal Californians do, we're actually going to take it one step further, we're gonna take it all the way to /a/.'"
17,136,Lauren,So that's why it sounded particularly over-caricatured.
17,137,Gretchen,"Yeah, so it's an exaggerated version of this vowel shift that California's already doing. And the same thing, that they're going to 'hyuge,' the /u/ vowel in California is moving towards the front of the mouth, where /ɪ/ was, but instead of just moving it like a little bit forward, /u/ to /ʉ/ --"
17,138,Lauren,Yeah.
17,139,Gretchen,"They're going way further forward. 'Hyuge.' I'm doing vocal fry at the same time, but, you know, you gotta keep your whole feature set together. So what's really interesting about this is, like, I am really sure that no one at SNL got out their vowel chart and was like, 'All right. What we really need to do...'"
17,140,Lauren,Where's the California vowel shift at now? Let's move it one step further.
17,141,Gretchen,"Let's move it one step further. Let's gather all the actors around, let's explain to them how the vowel system works, and let's tell them, 'Okay, every time you were going to say 'dip' you need to say 'dep' and this is why...' I am really sure they did not have a linguist on staff. And yet what they did is actually very linguistically consistent, it's a linguistic exaggeration that is very theoretically sound! And it's because, I'm sure what they actually did is something like someone was like, 'Hey, I can make this cool, exaggerated-sounding California accent! Everybody listen to me!' And people were like, 'Oh, that sounds fun! Let me imitate it too!' And so you get a bunch of people sitting around being like, 'Oh yeah, I can imitate this accent!' And someone was like, 'Let's make a sketch making fun of Californians!'"
17,142,Lauren,"And as things move, they don't all -- not all vowel shifts shift in the same way. And so, your example with Flight of the Conchords is a really great example. So, 'Brett' moves up to 'Brit,' so it's much higher. And then of course your 'dip' kind of sounds are like, 'hey, buddy we are here' and in California it goes down and it's still very front, it's /dɛp/."
17,143,Gretchen,"Yeah, so it's kind of the inverse shift. So, 'Brett' to 'Brit' and 'dip' to 'dep' are the opposite of the same thing, and it's sensitive to the same pair of 'these two sounds are similar to each other.'"
17,144,Lauren,"Yeah. And so while the Californian one went down to 'dep,' the New Zealand vowel shift goes down to 'dup,' which is more of an /ə/, or our friend the schwa."
17,145,Gretchen,"Ahh, because 'Brit' is taking up that..."
17,146,Lauren,"So 'Brit' has taken up that space. And so Californian English decided to go down to 'dep,' and New Zealand English has gone down to 'dup.'"
17,147,Gretchen,Do you have an example of this in a word?
17,148,Lauren,"Um, so, 'dup.' Or the famous shibboleth one for New Zealand English is talking about -- instead of ordering 'fish and chips' you order 'fush and chups.'"
17,149,Gretchen,Ahhh! Fush and chups!
17,150,Lauren,Is the uber-stereotyped. But it's that vowel is the main -- that little shift that's happening is the main way to distinguish New Zealand and Australian accent.
17,151,Gretchen,Yes. So you don't have any 'Brits' or 'chups.'
17,152,Lauren,"No, we have 'Brett' and we have 'fish and chips.'"
17,153,Gretchen,But a lot of the rest of the accent is very similar.
17,154,Lauren,Yes.
17,155,Gretchen,"Yeah, so there's your free 'How to Tell the Difference Between Australian and New Zealand Accents' feature."
17,156,Lauren,"And so these have both shifted. The same vowel in California has moved out of the same house as New Zealand, but they've moved into different neighbourhoods after that."
17,157,Gretchen,"Yeah, they took different paths along the hallway. I'm picturing like a dorm or something, where you have a bunch of rooms along a hall."
17,158,Lauren,"I'm thinking of the Cluedo board, personally."
17,159,Gretchen,"Okay! Did you ever play that game called Sorry? I don't know, maybe people call it Trouble? Is this a Canadian thing?"
17,160,Lauren,"Ah, yes, I've played Trouble. Is it called Sorry in Canada? That is the most Canadian board game I've ever heard of."
17,161,Gretchen,"'Cause when you knock someone out of their position in the game you have to say 'sorry!' But, like, you're not sincere about it."
17,162,Lauren,"No, only you have to say sorry, you Canadians. We can say, 'Ha, you're in trouble!'"
17,163,Gretchen,"No, we're like, 'Sorry!' But in a gleeful sense, not in an actually apologetic sense."
17,164,Lauren,So it's essentially like a re-skin of Ludo where you move different coloured counters around the board and you enjoy knocking people off the board.
17,165,Gretchen,"This is why I like talking about vowel gymnastics, because the vowels kind of topple over. They move in a cycle, they move around the whole space. They don't just do these individual, atomised things by themselves. There's also a really cool example of this in the history of English."
17,166,Lauren,"A really good example, called the Great Vowel Shift. It's pretty great."
17,167,Gretchen,"It's pretty great. It's the only one that has 'great' in the name. All the other ones are named after their locations, the Great Vowel Shift is just, you know, Vowel Shift the Great."
17,168,Lauren,"And it was great because it really changed the way English around the -- between, like, the 1300s and the 1600s? So, this is the reason why Chaucer and Shakespeare sound so different when you read them is because in between, all of the vowels in English really just started moving -- systematically, not chaotically -- around in the vowel space to the new homes that haven't moved that much since the 1600s."
17,169,Gretchen,"Yeah, I mean this is also the reason, if you've learned any other language that uses the Roman alphabet, that English spelling is so weird."
17,170,Lauren,Yep.
17,171,Gretchen,"So if you take a word like 'coffee' in English, and 'coffee' has this 'e-e' at the end. And the 'e-e' is a very standard English way of spelling the sound /i/. But in Old English, the letter that we now talk about as 'e' [i] was pronounced /e/. So a word like 'coffee' was pronounced more like 'coffay.'"
17,172,Lauren,Yeah.
17,173,Gretchen,"And if that sounds like the word 'café', which was borrowed in from French, and French did not have this shift happen, after the shift already happened... so 'coffee' and 'café', they used to be pronounced basically the same way."
17,174,Lauren,Yeah.
17,175,Gretchen,"Words like 'knee,' like the part of your body, were pronounced /kne/. So this /i/ - /e/ relationship -- so, the first thing that happens -- well, scholars aren't quite sure what order it happened, but let's say for the sake of argument that the /e/ sound pops up to the /i/ sound. So /kne/ becomes 'knee'."
17,176,Lauren,/met/ becomes 'meat'.
17,177,Gretchen,"Yeah. And then -- so, two things happen, right. So the one thing, the sound that was formerly the /i/ sound is like, 'Excuse me! I was here!'"
17,178,Lauren,"Yeah. And so it drops down, it becomes a diphthong, which is /ai/. So this is the letter 'I'."
17,179,Lauren,"So a word like /bit/ becomes our word 'bite,' as in 'don't bite that lollipop.' And so that /ai/, if you think about what's happening with that /ait/ in 'bite,' you're going from one part of the vowel space to the other, in the vowel. Compared to something like 'bit', which is just a single -- you're kind of going to one spot in the vowel space and hanging out there, 'bite' is like someone who owns two houses in different neighbourhoods and kind of moves between them."
17,180,Gretchen,"It's like if I bought the apartment next door and I put half my stuff in one and half the stuff in the other and I was like, 'I'm just going to hang out in both of these!'"
17,181,Lauren,"So we have 'bite' now, and that's become a diphthong."
17,182,Gretchen,"Yeah. It's two vowel sounds. And then -- now we're down at the bottom and we've got the regular /a/ sound, and it was like, 'Yeah, I'm just going to squish forward a little bit to get out of the way of /ai/!' And so you have /æ/, so in a word like --"
17,183,Lauren,So 'mate' was /mat/ and becomes 'mate.' It gets up and moves out a bit.
17,184,Gretchen,"Well, yeah, so it moves up into where /e/ was, because /kne/ left that space for it."
17,185,Lauren,Yep. We'll have a diagram of this in the show notes.
17,186,Gretchen,"It's helpful to have the audio for it, but it's hard to visualise! And so, they all moved around. And what's interesting is that -- so this is your 'coffay,' it was around there -- and the same thing happened for the back vowels. So a word like 'goose' with -- so, the double-o letter combination, which we think of as an /u/ in English, like 'goose,' was at one point pronounced /go:sə/."
17,187,Lauren,Hehehe!
17,188,Gretchen,Which is amazing.
17,189,Lauren,Yup.
17,190,Gretchen,"And the same thing as like the double-e in 'knee' -- /kne/, 'knee' --"
17,191,Lauren,/go:sə/.
17,192,Gretchen,/go:sə/.
17,193,Lauren,Goose.
17,194,Gretchen,Goose.
17,195,Lauren,Goin' up.
17,196,Gretchen,So they both moved up.
17,197,Lauren,Yep.
17,198,Gretchen,"And the actual letter /u/ -- well, that one kind of became... it did a bunch of things."
17,199,Lauren,"Yeah, so not all of them stayed exactly the same, and there were all these other factors involved, but the important thing is vowels started shifting. And they did this on a massive scale, and it changed what we think of as the way English is spoken. And it certainly didn't help with how it was written!"
17,200,Gretchen,"And it had this weird repercussion. So, a lot of people learned in school that English has the long vowels and the short vowels. And the mnemonic that I learned was the long vowels are the ones that say their own name -- so 'e, a, u, o', those are the ones that say their own name -- and the short vowels like /ɪ/ and /ɛ/ and /a/ don't say their own name."
17,201,Lauren,Yes.
17,202,Gretchen,But that's a weird mnemonic! Why are we calling them long and short for that reason? And it's because --
17,203,Lauren,Especially when we've just learnt the word diphthong!
17,204,Gretchen,"I know! It's because in the history of English, and in many modern languages still currently, there are long and short vowels, and the long vowels are literally pronounced for a longer period of time. That's the difference."
17,205,Lauren,Yep. That is the difference.
17,206,Gretchen,"So if you have something like /bet/ and /be:t/, one of those is just longer. Or hypothetically you have /kne/ and /kne:/."
17,207,Lauren,"Which is really hard as an English-speaker to get the hang of because you're used to hearing these clear differences in the place, or that they're diphthongs or something like that."
17,208,Gretchen,Or /go:s/ and /go::s/.
17,209,Lauren,You've made a ridiculous word even more ridiculous.
17,210,Gretchen,"I'm doing great at this. And so what happened was this change affected only the English long vowels. They shifted. They were all in competition with each other. And the English short vowels stayed pretty much where they were and did pretty much a similar thing. So we used to have these nice pairs of /i/ and /i:/, /e/ and /e:/, /a/ and /a:/. And it was very symmetric. And, you know, it has a little bit of a different sound quality to it, but it was pretty much just the length that made the distinction. And this is what Latin had had, for example. Latin had /a/ and /a:/, /i/ and /i:/. And so Latin was like, 'Look, I've got five vowels, they come in long and short versions, but that's pretty easy, so I'm just going to have five vowel letters.' And Old English had pretty much five vowels and long and short versions! And so five vowel letters was very reasonable. And then this vowel shift happened and now your long /e:/ is being pronounced /i/, and your long /i:/ being pronounced /ai/, and the short --"
17,211,Lauren,But you still only got five letters to write it with!
17,212,Gretchen,I know! And they have so little relationship with each other except historically!
17,213,Lauren,Yup.
17,214,Gretchen,"And it just -- like, that's why English spelling is so completely weird. Partly because of this thing that happened in the Middle Ages when a whole bunch of vowels shifted and we kept writing them the same way, because the writing system was already established. And then, because this thing on top of it where now we have a whole bunch of different varieties of English and a lot of them are undergoing their own separate vowel shifts, and they're still all being written the same way."
17,215,Lauren,"Which brings us to a really interesting question, which is how does the IPA deal with vowels? Because we have this infinite possibility of spaces where vowels could be, but we have to write them in some way, and obviously the English system is not going to work."
17,216,Gretchen,"The English system is not going to work. And you do see this sometimes, so sometimes if you see languages that have been written with other writing systems -- they get romanised, they have different romanisation versions of them -- depending on when that romanisation happened, sometimes the romanisation will use English conventions. So, for example, if you think of the Chinese last name 'Lee,' sometimes it's written L-E-E, which is using the English convention, that double-e stands for the /i/ sound. And sometimes that same last name is written L-I, which is using a different convention that the letter 'I', which in every other language that uses the Roman alphabet, you know, French and Spanish and so on, that's what that letter stands for. So you can look at transcription systems and say, 'Okay, was this person using an English perspective or an international, Latin-based perspective when they were romanising this particular writing system?' And the IPA does this too."
17,217,Lauren,"And the IPA has picked the most common salient points on the space in terms of whether it's near the front or the back, and also whether the lips are rounded or not. So the difference between /i/ and the French /y/, that front rounded vowel, the only difference is that your lips are brought together in a rounded --"
17,218,Gretchen,Making a circle!
17,219,Lauren,-- thing or not. Yeah.
17,220,Gretchen,"Yeah, so the IPA does take this international perspective, so when you're learning the IPA vowels, if you speak, you know, literally any other language that uses the Roman alphabet, Spanish being one of them or Italian or something, the regular-looking vowels in the IPA look very familiar. So you'll have, like, 'café' is a perfectly good IPA word except for the 'C' at the beginning, because 'C' is weird. But the 'a' and the 'é' are IPA-ish. Whereas 'coffee' gets written completely differently in IPA because they're like, 'Look, English did this weird thing in the Middle Ages, but we're not going to do it like that for an international standard.' Which means that it's really weird as an English speaker, because you learn to read IPA and you're like, 'Wow, this is so weird and difficult!' And then you try to read IPA Spanish and you're like, 'This is strangely easy and I'm suspicious of how easy it is.'"
17,221,Lauren,"And it's because when you use more than just the five vowels and 'Y' that we have in our writing system (and 'W') you begin to realise that English has way more than five vowels. English has, like, twelve vowels, which makes it --"
17,222,Gretchen,Or fourteen! Depends on the dialect!
17,223,Lauren,"Or fourteen, depending on how much merging are doing. Which makes it one of the largest vowel inventories cross-linguistically."
17,224,Gretchen,"Yeah! So, English has a pretty normal amount of consonants, but it's got a very large vowel inventory because it has this weird split with the long vowels where they all became completely different, weird vowels. So a language like Arabic is generally considered to have three vowels, /a/, /i/, and /u/."
17,225,Lauren,Yep.
17,226,Gretchen,And then it also has long versions of all of those. But that's still really kind of three vowels plus length.
17,227,Lauren,"A lot of Australian Indigenous languages have only three vowels, but what that means is that there's a lot more variation in how you can pronounce them. So if you only have an /i/, /a/, and /o/, your /a/ could be, like, anywhere -- it's a much larger house that it's living in in the vowel space. And there's a lot more variation in how people pronounce it. Whereas for a language like English, you've got to fit fourteen vowels into the same space and so you have to make much clearer distinctions between them."
17,228,Gretchen,"Yeah, and the same thing is true in Arabic, like there's -- it has some consonants that English doesn't have. So you have siin and Saad, which are two different 'S' sounds."
17,229,Lauren,Yep.
17,230,Gretchen,"But what they did for me when I was learning Arabic, perceptually as an English speaker, is they really change the vowel quality around it. So if you had /si/ -- if you had the kind of regular 'S' with an /i/ vowel, it would be like /si/. But if you had it with the the other kind of 'S' with the /i/ vowel, it would be more like /sɛ/. It would bring the /i/ down. And you'd write the /i/ the same way it was the 'S' that was officially different, but when I was trying to wrap my head around this I was like, 'Wow, I can really easily hear this difference between where the vowels are, it's just that vowels aren't officially part of this system.'"
17,231,Lauren,Yep. And they've got much more -- they've got a bigger house to move around in.
17,232,Gretchen,"Yeah, so they've got more elbow room, and when you're coming from a language that makes fewer vowel distinctions and trying to learn a whole bunch of them, now you've got to carve up this piece that you're really not used to dealing with at all."
17,233,Lauren,"Most important question I think we have to ask for this episode,"
17,234,Gretchen,What's your favourite vowel?
17,235,Gretchen,"I really like /y/, like the French or German -- it's like /i/ but your lips are rounded -- /y/ sound."
17,236,Lauren,It's a good one.
17,237,Gretchen,"It's so good! Because it's not an English-y vowel, but it's easy to describe to English speakers? Because you can very mechanically produce an /i/ /u/ /y/ -- 'Oh, okay! It's there!' And it just sounds so cool, it sounds very, I don't know, flute-like."
17,238,Lauren,Yeah! It's a good one.
17,239,Gretchen,What's your favourite vowel?
17,240,Lauren,"Well, I mean, obviously, given that it is the Superlinguo logo, have a bit of an affinity for schwa."
17,241,Gretchen,Mmm.
17,242,Lauren,I think we need to do a whole schwa episode.
17,243,Gretchen,We do.
17,244,Lauren,It's a pretty good vowel.
17,245,Gretchen,"It's a great vowel, and it's so weird."
17,246,Lauren,"It has some really interesting properties. It, uh, yeah. I just really like it, and I like that, you know --"
17,247,Gretchen,"So schwa's the vowel in, like, 'sofa' or 'potato.'"
17,248,Lauren,Yeah. It looks like an upside down 'e'.
17,249,Gretchen,Yeah.
17,250,Lauren,"And I think I like that about it, it was like the first non-general Latin alphabet vowel that made sense to me."
17,251,Gretchen,"Yeah. And one of the cool things about vowels as a space is that languages tend to make efficient use of the space. So you get a fair number of languages that have five vowels or have three vowels, and when a language has just five or three vowels, it tends to be the same ones. So it's either /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/, or it's /i/, /u/, /a/. Because you're trying to occupy all different corners very efficiently."
17,252,Lauren,Yeah. Useful if you want to design a naturalistic conlang to know this fact.
17,253,Gretchen,Yeah.
17,254,Lauren,"We also have a whole bunch of vowel-related links. I once made a cross-stitched schwa, I've made schwa gingerbread -- it's a bit of a reoccurring theme for me..."
17,255,Gretchen,"There's this really excellent embroidery of all of the different -- so there's a set of key words called the Wells Lexical Sets which are specific words that you can use to talk about specific vowels, because it's gonna get hard to say, like, 'the /a/ vowel' or 'the /i/ vowel.' So you have, like, 'foot' and 'strut' and 'goose' to talk about /ʊ/ and /ʌ/ and /u/."
17,256,Lauren,"Yeah. We made them into a set with emoji, but someone made a really beautiful cross-stitch with different animals."
17,257,Gretchen,"Someone made a really beautiful cross-stitch of it, somebody else also dressed up as all of the different Wells Lexical Sets for Halloween."
17,258,Lauren,"Last Halloween, that was great."
17,259,Gretchen,"She got her whole department, everybody dressed up as a different, you know, a goose and these kinds of things."
17,260,Lauren,Yep.
17,261,Gretchen,And so those are really good. So vowels have a bit of a meme-ish quality as well as their serious acoustic quality.

18,1,Gretchen,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics! I'm Gretchen McCulloch."
18,2,Lauren,"And I'm Lauren Gawne, and today we're talking about how to translate untranslatable words. But first, it's our Patreon anniversary!"
18,3,Gretchen,Yay!
18,4,Lauren,"And we are super excited to revisit the topic that we visited for our first episode, which is swearing. Yayyy, rude episode on Patreon!"
18,5,Gretchen,"So our first Patreon episode was all about the sounds of swearing and swearing in different languages, and this time we're talking about the grammar of swearing, and we already have reports that it made somebody laugh out loud in public, so maybe don't listen to it around young children or in public, because you might have to explain to them why you're laughing so hard. You can go check that out at patreon.com/lingthusiasm."
18,6,Lauren,"We also, conveniently for our anniversary, unlocked a new Patreon goal, which we are really excited about. This one is a goal to commission some Lingthusiasm-themed art."
18,7,Gretchen,Yes! So we're very excited to have some exciting art and for you guys to get to see concept sketches and where things go from here! Stay tuned for more exciting Lingthusiasm art news. [Music]
18,8,Gretchen,"Untranslatable words! Lauren, have you come across any untranslatable words lately?"
18,9,Lauren,"It's because I came across, like, three in the space of a day that I was like, 'We really have to talk about this topic.' Because it's a bit of a linguist meme, or talking about language meme, is this idea that there are some words that just aren't translatable, or meanings for which we don't have a single word and maybe we should. So the first is a Language Log post from Mark Liberman. He was talking about how there was a big, windy, wintry, weathery event in Philadelphia that meant that there were a lot of discarded umbrellas left around, and he talked about how there's no word for a dead umbrella."
18,10,Gretchen,Isn't the word for a dead umbrella just 'dead umbrella' or 'broken umbrella'?
18,11,Lauren,Well...
18,12,Gretchen,I don't know why this has to be so hard!
18,13,Lauren,"We can chat about it, but he felt like it was something that needed a word and a blog post. And the other one --"
18,14,Gretchen,Is it an UNbrella?
18,15,Lauren,An unbrella.
18,16,Gretchen,We need to write in to Mark.
18,17,Lauren,Yep. We solved it!
18,18,Gretchen,You have your umbrellas and then you have your unbrellas.
18,19,Lauren,"And the second blog post about untranslatable words, or no word in a language, was from my favourite gynaecologist, Dr. Jennifer Gunter, who has a really fabulous blog, and she she was talking about -- I'll just read the quote. 'I believe there is no word in any language to describe that unique experience that's simultaneously running out of both pads (or tampons) and toilet paper when you're sitting on the toilet and in immediate need of both.'"
18,20,Gretchen,"This is a terrible situation, but I think she's described it! I don't know, like, am I the untranslatable word sceptic here? But I think she's, you know, just put several words together and it did a pretty good job of describing this relatable experience."
18,21,Lauren,"But there's no single word that encapsulates -- I mean, there are plenty of single words and most of them are more appropriate for a Patreon episode than this episode -- but none that specifically encapsulates that meaning."
18,22,Gretchen,"Yeah, I mean, so this is a thing that I've been thinking about in terms of what I've called 'the schadenfreude effect,' which is, you know when you learn the schadenfreude and you're like, 'Wow! The Germans! They really do have a word for everything, like taking pleasure in someone else's misfortune! It's not just me who's uniquely terrible by doing this sometimes! Other people do this too! Whoa, mind blown!' And the thing that I think makes us resonate with these lists of untranslatable words or ideas that certain concepts are untranslatable or there should be a word for something is that words are way of packaging our experiences, and if we have a word for something, then we know that someone else has thought of packaging that particular experience before. And so saying, 'Oh, is there a word for this?' is also kind of trying to reach for 'haven't other people also had this common experience' or 'isn't this something else that other people have also felt.'"
18,23,Lauren,I really like that you've coined the term 'schadenfreude effect' to really encapsulate the meaning of feeling pleased that you found a word that neatly translates a concept that you thought didn't have an elegant word for it.
18,24,Gretchen,"Yeah, it's kind of when you encounter a word that describes something you're already familiar with. And I came up with it actually because there's this paper that I really like about people learning words and how best to teach people new concepts and new vocabulary. And so they did this study, and I think was a biology class or an economics class, I don't remember, an intro class at a university somewhere, and some of the students got a reading, kind of your standard textbook reading that is, like, you know, 'Mitosis is blah blah blah...' and 'Supply and demand is blah blah blah' -- I don't remember whether this was biology or economics, so..."
18,25,Lauren,The biology/economics textbook.
18,26,Gretchen,"In the highly in-demand Intro Bio/Econ course! So anyway, they got your kind of standard reading that had a bunch of terms with their definitions, and then the other people got a different reading which was a version where you had all the concepts explained to you, saying, 'There is a concept in biology where cells divide blah blah blah' or in economics where people buy things at different rates. And then for those students, they got to class and they got a brief list of vocabulary words that said, 'These concepts that you were exposed to in the reading, here are the words for them.' And then they did a post-test on how well the students did in learning these concepts, and they found that the students that had been exposed to the concept before the jargon did better than the students that were exposed to the jargon and the concept at the same time or even the jargon first."
18,27,Lauren,So it's not just a matter of smashing words into your brain.
18,28,Gretchen,"Yeah, and it's -- you know, when you come across a word like 'schadenfreude' and you're like, 'Wow, this is so satisfying to learn this,' the reason it's satisfying to learn the word 'schadenfreude' is because you're already familiar with the feeling."
18,29,Lauren,Right.
18,30,Gretchen,"And it's less satisfying to learn a word like, I don't know, 'mitosis' or something because you're not familiar with this concept before you learn the word, so you're having to learn the word and the concept at the same time."
18,31,Lauren,I guess it's why -- and this is gonna date this podcast horrifically -- why 'hygge' has resonated so much with people in the last 18 months. It's just been like a hygge bonanza of like --
18,32,Gretchen,Mm-hmm!
18,33,Lauren,"-- Danish/Scandinavian, cosy, thoughtful, living books."
18,34,Gretchen,"Yeah, and it's all about this, like, okay here's this concept that we'd like to be able to reach for, or this idea that we'd like to be able to articulate better, like, doesn't everyone want more cosiness in their lives? And it comes with a lot of cultural stuff, but it's around the idea of people wanting more cosiness, or more of whatever it is that thing that the Danes have. I think this is the same reason why words like 'tsundoku' often show up on untranslatable words lists as well. So this is the Japanese word for the pile of books that you haven't gotten around to reading yet."
18,35,Lauren,What's wrong with 'my pile of unread books'?
18,36,Gretchen,"Yeah, I mean, I know a lot of people who talk about their 'TBR pile,' which is their 'to be read' pile, or their reading list?"
18,37,Lauren,Mmm.
18,38,Gretchen,"And as far as I can tell, they're used pretty similarly to 'tsundoku'! But we're familiar with the idea of 'of course you have this pile of books you haven't gotten around to reading yet.'"
18,39,Lauren,Yep.
18,40,Gretchen,"And, oh, isn't it convenient that there's this convenient package for this thing that you either are intimately familiar with, or that you would like to be more familiar with, as in the case with 'hygge.'"
18,41,Lauren,"It's interesting how sometimes these words will enter into English. So, like, schadenfreude I think is -- I mean, you can tell from my very Australianising of it, like it's a comfortable piece of my vocabulary, I can use it actively in a sentence, and I feel really comfortable with it. But, like, I think 'hygge' is kind of crossing into that at the moment? I don't -- I think it's too faddy, personally."
18,42,Gretchen,"Yeah, I think it may still be too much of a fad at the moment, but it may be crossing over. I heard someone saying 'tsundoku' in a sentence in English, but she was someone who'd lived in Japan for a while, so I don't think she was using it Anglicised? So I don't know which ones of these are crossing over."
18,43,Lauren,Yep.
18,44,Gretchen,"But one of the things that I always think about what I think about these lists of 'oh, here's a bunch of words that are untranslatable,' is first of all, well, here is this convenient column B where someone just provided a bunch of nice translations for them. So how untranslatable are they, really? And also that if you look at a language just through the lens of its lexicon, you can end up with some really weird conclusions."
18,45,Lauren,Yeah.
18,46,Gretchen,"And my favourite example of this is French doesn't have a word for 'please.' Therefore, obviously, the French, they must be very impolite...maybe. But what they do have is a four-word phrase, 's'il vous plait,' which comes in another form, which is 's'il te plait,' which both mean effectively 'please.' And in fact they come in formal and informal versions, this phrase that means effectively 'please.' And so, sure, if we look at the lexicon of French, the individual, atomisable words with spaces in between them, like, 'Oh dang, there's no equivalent for please! Like, how do you even be polite in this language?' But if you look at it even just one step further in subtlety, of course there are lots of ways to be polite in this language! And so, seeing a language just through the lens of its lexicon -- on the one hand, it gets us some of these interesting packages, but on the other hand it misses out on a whole lot of what a language actually is if all we're doing is looking at the lists of words and their translations."
18,47,Lauren,It reminds me of the 'there's no way to say 'yes' and 'no' in Mandarin' meme?
18,48,Gretchen,Mm-hmm.
18,49,Lauren,"That there isn't just a convenient word like 'yes' we see that you can use to answer an affirmative, and no equivalent of 'no' that you can just use to say no to a question that someone asks. And it's because you say -- if, you know, someone says, 'Do you want this?' you use the equivalent of 'want' or 'don't want.'"
18,50,Gretchen,"Oh, Gaelic does this too."
18,51,Lauren,Yeah! So just because you can't find 'yes' or 'no' in a simple word list doesn't mean you're unable to say it.
18,52,Gretchen,"Like, 'Whoa, you can't do negation or affirmative in these languages!' Clearly the speakers are capable of agreeing and disagreeing with things."
18,53,Lauren,"'Yes and no are untranslatable!' And it's just like, oh, they have some way of expressing affirmative and negative. Life is going on."
18,54,Gretchen,"Yeah! But something that interests me is the subtler domains where things are actually harder to translate as well. And one of the big areas for me for that is poetry, because what makes a poem, essentially, is that you have a relationship with form and meaning that is aesthetically pleasing."
18,55,Lauren,And contextually dependent.
18,56,Gretchen,"And different languages do have different relationships between form and meaning. So to take a very simple example, a pair of words that rhyme in English don't necessarily rhyme in another language you might be trying to translate a poem to. So if you have something like 'roses are red, violets are blue, sugar is sweet, and I love you' the kind of classic, four-line, parodisable poem in English --"
18,57,Lauren,"All versions of that poem are said in deep, deep earnest, Gretchen. It's the most moving piece of poetry."
18,58,Gretchen,"So moving. Why wasn't this our Valentine's Day episode? Um, so you have something like this, but 'blue' and 'you' rhyme in English, and they don't rhyme in many other languages. There's no particular reason why they have to rhyme, it's just they happen to in English and so they make good subjects for poems, and that's why we don't say 'violets are purple' because 'purple' doesn't rhyme with 'you.' And so when you try to translate that in another language, either you've got to be unfaithful to the meaning and use a different pair of words that do rhyme, or you've got to be unfaithful to the rhyme and then not reproduce the aesthetic experience of getting the poem. And so because there's this inherent asymmetry, because different languages have different words -- shockingly! -- it's really hard to translate things that rely on both the form and the meaning simultaneously."
18,59,Lauren,"I remember learning to read Old English poetry, and I just couldn't get my head around it -- it involves alliteration, they weren't really big into rhyming."
18,60,Gretchen,Mm!
18,61,Lauren,"And I was just like, 'I don't have a feeling for this being good.' You know, my Old English teacher would just be like, 'Yeah, this is such a great poem, you can feel the rhythm!' and I'm just like, 'Oh, but there's no rhyming...'"
18,62,Gretchen,Everything's gotta rhyme.
18,63,Lauren,"Yeah, I don't know how to evaluate this."
18,64,Gretchen,"I remember I tried to read Hamlet in French once because, you know, whatever."
18,65,Lauren,How did that go?
18,66,Gretchen,"Well, what was really interesting for me is, you know, the thing about Hamlet, and Shakespeare in general, is that Shakespeare is all in iambic pentameter, right?"
18,67,Lauren,Mm-hmm.
18,68,Gretchen,"And so you have your, like, duh-DUH beat, your iamb, with weak-strong --"
18,69,Lauren,"Yeah, even my 'mm-hmm' was in iambic pentameter, I was really impressed. Mm-hmm."
18,70,Gretchen,"Mm-hmm! There you go. And you have five of those per line, but in French you can't do that, because French doesn't have word-level stress the way English does."
18,71,Lauren,"Right, yeah."
18,72,Gretchen,"And I'm sure we'll probably do, at some point, a full stress episode, but in French you just only ever stress the thing that's at the end of the whole sentence or phrase. That's it, that's all you do, you have to do it that way."
18,73,Lauren,Okay. Yup.
18,74,Gretchen,"And so you can't divide a poem into beats like that, because French doesn't do beats that way. And so what French poetry has instead that's, like, stylistically similar to iambic pentameter is something called the alexandrine, which is twelve syllables per line. So iambic pentameter gives you ten syllables per line, the alexandrine gives you twelve, which is pretty similar, and so this translation of Hamlet was all written in alexandrines with the twelve syllables per line."
18,75,Lauren,So they get an extra two syllables per line.
18,76,Gretchen,Yeah!
18,77,Lauren,The whole thing goes for like an extra 20% of time.
18,78,Gretchen,But it often takes more syllables to say the same thing in French anyway.
18,79,Lauren,"Oh, okay."
18,80,Gretchen,Because French is kind of spacious like that.
18,81,Lauren,Yep.
18,82,Gretchen,"So I think it kind of balanced out. But yeah, you just got this very different --"
18,83,Lauren,And was it in modern French or ye olde French?
18,84,Gretchen,"I... don't remember. I think it was in pretty modern French, though, it didn't feel super ye olde."
18,85,Lauren,Right.
18,86,Gretchen,"But I also don't necessarily know what ye olde French would sound like, you know?"
18,87,Lauren,"Fair enough! Because sometimes, like, translating across time -- you know, we talk about translating between cultures and what I think is, dare I say, a bit of fetishisation of, like, Scandinavian and Japanese social life that we overextend, one way of kind of borrowing their words that translate interestingly. And we forget that translating from older texts, like translating from Shakespeare, or going back further to something like Beowulf, there's actually a lot that's not easily translated between those."
18,88,Gretchen,"Yeah, and when you're translating something like -- you know, Shakespeare's stuff was written in current English to the original audience he was writing to, he wasn't writing in fake ye olde English, and so do you try to be faithful to that for the modern reader, or do you try to reproduce the experience of the modern reader in experiencing that as something old? Something I've been really fascinated about recently has been the Emily Wilson translation of The Odyssey."
18,89,Lauren,Mmm!
18,90,Gretchen,"Oh, it's so cool. I follow her on Twitter now, it's really great. So, she is heralded as the first woman to translate The Odyssey into English, which is kind of shocking that we've gotten this far and it took that long."
18,91,Lauren,"I'd have to say most of the versions that I have ever come across have been quite dusty, dry, like they feel like they were written at the time of Homer, even though they're in English."
18,92,Gretchen,"Well, not quite Homer, but like this kind of 1800s feel."
18,93,Lauren,Yep.
18,94,Gretchen,"And that's the thing, like even the ones that were written in, like, I don't know, the 1950s, often have this fake ye olde thing because, like, oh, well, Homer is a classic and so you need to make him sound olde."
18,95,Lauren,So what's Emily Wilson done?
18,96,Gretchen,"And so Wilson doesn't do that. She's not doing ye olde, and her first line that she translates the poem as is, 'Tell me about a complicated man,' which is referring to Odysseus."
18,97,Lauren,"Oh, that could be a text that I sent someone."
18,98,Gretchen,"That's an Avril Lavigne song! Like, 'Odysseus, why did you have to go make things so complicated? Right now I'm just unweaving this loom and man I really hate it!' You know, like, that's a very real translation! But she also -- and this is something that the other translators also don't do -- she also translates the whole epic poem in verse, and she does all of her lines in iambic pentameter."
18,99,Lauren,Right.
18,100,Gretchen,"And the other translators tend to render it in prose, or in, like, shortened lines, but without paying attention to that beat in the same sort of way."
18,101,Lauren,Yeah.
18,102,Gretchen,"And so I'm also really holding out for the audiobook version of this translation of The Odyssey, because I want to hear it read. It was originally an oral piece of a literature, and I really want to hear someone render it to me in that sort of way."
18,103,Lauren,"Mm, that would be fun."
18,104,Gretchen,"Yeah! I'm excited. It's one of my post-book projects, I'm gonna dive into that pretty deeply, I think."
18,105,Lauren,Awesome.
18,106,Gretchen,"Yeah! So untranslatability, when it comes to things like how do you render -- and I think the Greek word that she's trying to render with 'complicated' is 'polytropos'? I'm probably getting that wrong. But it means, like, 'many-turning'?"
18,107,Lauren,Mm-hmm.
18,108,Gretchen,"'Poly' meaning 'many' and 'tropos' is 'turning,' like a heliotrope is a flower that turns towards the sun."
18,109,Lauren,Yep.
18,110,Gretchen,"But 'many-turned' is not really an idiom in English. And so different translators try to render that idiom in different sorts of ways that both try to make it legible for the reader and also try to make it sound somewhat idiomatic and give you a sense of the feeling of the source text, in a short amount of space."
18,111,Lauren,"I mean, idioms are super difficult because they're often multiple words, or if it's just one word, alluding to the whole idiom. Like, idioms already come as complicated sets of words that have a specific meaning that you can't just go, like, 'word + word.' You know, 'looking a gift horse in the mouth,' you can't say 'look + horse + gift + mouth = ...'"
18,112,Gretchen,"That's a nice Greek idiom, Lauren!"
18,113,Lauren,"Yeah, I'm just keeping on-theme. You have to know about how gifts work and how horses work -- and actually I don't actually know how horses' mouths work, I just know that you want to make sure they're healthy and that's apparently the mouth!"
18,114,Gretchen,"Yeah, I remember I was reading a book that I'd -- when I was practising French I was reading stuff in French I'd already read in English."
18,115,Lauren,Yeah.
18,116,Gretchen,"And the English passage of this book had said something like 'doing this thing was carrying coal to Newcastle,' which, I've never been to Newcastle, but I know that this is an idiom for, you know, Newcastle is a big producer of coal and so why would you bring coal to Newcastle, Newcastle already has the coals."
18,117,Lauren,Yeah. Was it 'taking croissants to Paris'?
18,118,Gretchen,I wish it was! They just said something like 'it was just a drop of water in the ocean'.
18,119,Lauren,Taking mustard to Dijon.
18,120,Gretchen,"I don't think those are idioms in French the same way that 'coals to Newcastle' is an idiom in English, right? So that would be kind of bringing you out by saying, 'Oh, what what is this weird idiom that they have?' So instead they had just 'is a drop of water in the ocean,' which is kind of idiomatic, but is also something you could interpret at a very literal level and it doesn't particularly require context for the idiom."
18,121,Lauren,Yeah.
18,122,Gretchen,"Because also the book wasn't supposed to be set in France, so it'd be weird to have a very French-y idiom."
18,123,Lauren,"Uh-huh. So, we can have this kind of translatability complication over time in English, but we could also have it over space because English is a language that is spoken in many places, and many places have their own words that have their own specific meaning."
18,124,Gretchen,"Yeah, I really do like adding to those 'untranslatable' lists, like, here's this very specific meaning that this Japanese pile of books brings to you. English has a specific verb for 'to deceive someone into watching a video of Rick Astley's 'Never Gonna Give You Up.''"
18,125,Lauren,"Hey, wait! We do!"
18,126,Gretchen,What does it say about the English speakers that we have the verb 'to rickroll.'
18,127,Lauren,Oh my gosh. It's such a profound reflection on what it means to be an English speaker on the internet that we have created the word rickroll.
18,128,Gretchen,"I know, right?"
18,129,Lauren,"I never thought about it like that before, it's really fun to flip this trope around!"
18,130,Gretchen,"Yeah! You know, like, the English speakers -- like, it's gonna be on a French word list somewhere and be like, 'Look at those English speakers, look what they've done!'"
18,131,Lauren,"Oh, that one's gonna date really badly as well."
18,132,Gretchen,"Nah, rickroll's a classic. And there's different words in Canadian English and Australian English that sometimes have different connotations."
18,133,Lauren,"And since we bump into this occasionally, I thought we would do a mini quiz round!"
18,134,Gretchen,Okay! Are you gonna quiz me?
18,135,Lauren,I'm gonna quiz you. I have some words here that have very specific meanings in Australian English.
18,136,Gretchen,Mm-hmm.
18,137,Lauren,And I want you to have a go at what you think they mean.
18,138,Gretchen,Okay.
18,139,Lauren,The first word is 'bogan.'
18,140,Gretchen,"I'm familiar with 'bogan,' but I don't know if I could actually define it? Is it kind of like a hick, but in Australia? Or like a chav, but in Australia?"
18,141,Lauren,I like that you're going for definition by triangulation.
18,142,Gretchen,"Yeeeah... like, it's kind of more like working-class, salt-of-the-earth, but also the people that politicians kind of try to make up to?"
18,143,Lauren,"Yeah, that's actually -- you did pretty good there. That's good."
18,144,Gretchen,Yay!
18,145,Lauren,"But you can identify them from the particular sports that they're interested in, like the footy, like the cricket, something something outdoors, something something wearing flannel."
18,146,Gretchen,Okay.
18,147,Lauren,It's kind of a set of meaning that goes together to define --
18,148,Gretchen,"I mean, in Canada they like the hockey, so I think I may somewhat understand this demographic."
18,149,Lauren,Yeah. The next word is 'mateship.'
18,150,Gretchen,"So, because I know that you say -- people say 'mate' in Australian English to be like, 'G'day, mate,' or like, 'What are you doing mate, that was a bad idea.' So mateship is like the quality of having mates or like the relationship that you have with your mates? Or... this kind of thing?"
18,151,Lauren,"Uh, yeah! I mean, that is great, you've just kind of said the meaning of both of those words at the same time. Good start!"
18,152,Gretchen,Is there something else I should be adding?
18,153,Lauren,"It's something to do with the ineffable quality of reciprocal support. It's tied in a lot with the idea of community -- not gonna lie, it has a kind of Anglo vibe. It's --"
18,154,Gretchen,"Oh my god, it's Australian hygge."
18,155,Lauren,It's Australian political dog-whistling to like --
18,156,Gretchen,Ohhh.
18,157,Lauren,"-- you know, the way things should be, i.e. back when Australia was quite Anglo. (It never really was, but that's another point.) Or this kind of idea of Australians as like battlers forged through hardship and adversity and are now somehow all kind of closely knit for that. Is my kind of definition of mateship."
18,158,Gretchen,"Okay. Yeah, I definitely don't have the political context there."
18,159,Lauren,It doesn't stir your soul? That's what it's meant to evoke.
18,160,Gretchen,"It just... ships my mates, mate!"
18,161,Lauren,The final one is 'early mark.'
18,162,Gretchen,I have no idea.
18,163,Lauren,"Have a guess, just make up..."
18,164,Gretchen,"A... like, something that... like, when you're like 'on your marks, get set, go' so it's like the early... first thing you do?"
18,165,Lauren,Mmm... no.
18,166,Gretchen,I told you I didn't know!
18,167,Lauren,"This one is not even -- like, so this is not a word that I have in my active vocabulary."
18,168,Gretchen,Okay.
18,169,Lauren,"And it shows that like even in a country like Australia, which has a really quite homogeneous use of language across Australia, given how big it is, this is from New South Wales and Queensland?"
18,170,Gretchen,Okay.
18,171,Lauren,And an 'early mark' means you get to leave school or work early.
18,172,Gretchen,Ahhh!
18,173,Lauren,I have no idea why. New South Wales never really explained it to me.
18,174,Gretchen,"I have a word for that, but I don't remember what it is."
18,175,Lauren,Is it 'leaving work early'?
18,176,Gretchen,"Yeah, okay. No, no, there's like an idiom to it, and I'm sure my high school self is reaching through time and being like 'how did you forget this??'"
18,177,Lauren,It was very important to you.
18,178,Gretchen,"Yeah, it was really important to me for 13 years, and now I can't remember. I can remember the concept, but not the term."
18,179,Lauren,"Well, there you have -- it's an untranslatable word for you, Gretchen! It's a concept you're very familiar with and you've never had --"
18,180,Gretchen,"No, it's a schadenfreude thing!"
18,181,Lauren,It's the schadenfreude effect from English to English.
18,182,Gretchen,"Okay, can I give you a Canadian one?"
18,183,Lauren,Sure.
18,184,Gretchen,"So, are you familiar with the Canadianism 'toque'?"
18,185,Lauren,"I am, but I feel like I'm not gonna know where to draw the boundary on it."
18,186,Gretchen,"Okay, well, try."
18,187,Lauren,"So, I know it's a hat."
18,188,Gretchen,Mm-hmm.
18,189,Lauren,Umm... yay for having Canadian rellos.
18,190,Gretchen,'Relatives' for the non-Australians.
18,191,Lauren,Thanks for translating for me!
18,192,Gretchen,Welcome!
18,193,Lauren,"Um, it's a hat, but it's like a hat you wear in the cold."
18,194,Gretchen,Mm-hmm.
18,195,Lauren,"Like, I'm gonna translate it into my English and say it's a beanie, which is like a knitted, or like thick, woollen hat that doesn't have a brim or anything, it's just like an egg-warmer for your head."
18,196,Gretchen,"Yeah, Americans do call it 'beanie,' so I wasn't sure if you'd have beanie as a term, because it's like kind of warm to wear beanies in Australia. So yeah, people call it a beanie, I have a beanie as something very different."
18,197,Lauren,"What's a beanie, then, for you?"
18,198,Gretchen,"A beanie is one of those, like, round caps that has like a spinny thing on top? That they wore in like the '20s or something?"
18,199,Lauren,"Ahhhh. No. Gee, that's so confusing. How do we even talk to each other? Sometimes it's a complete mystery to me."
18,200,Gretchen,I know.
18,201,Lauren,"It's going to be very difficult if I ever come and visit you in the cold. 'Don't come here with a beanie, you need to bring a toque.'"
18,202,Gretchen,"I may own a few toques, but I do not own any hats with little spinny things on top, and I do not aspire to."
18,203,Lauren,"Ah, well. So, even when we speak the same language, we still kind of reach these moments of translation where we have to hopefully figure out that we're not talking about the same beanie."
18,204,Gretchen,"Yeah. I know, personally, I think that my favourite really difficult word in English to translate is 'the.'"
18,205,Lauren,"That's not gonna look nice on any lists, Gretchen."
18,206,Gretchen,"But it's so difficult! Because, you know, some languages don't have articles like 'the' and 'a' and 'an' at all! Russian doesn't have them, Chinese doesn't have them I don't think, and there's a whole bunch of languages that don't have this at all, and so trying to translate into those languages is really hard, and for speakers of those languages, trying to learn English and being like, 'Should I be using the 'the'? But how do you know?' And then there's a bunch of languages that have, like, several of them!"
18,207,Lauren,Yeah.
18,208,Gretchen,And then even languages which have what is ostensibly still a definite article don't use them in the same sorts of ways.
18,209,Lauren,Yeah.
18,210,Gretchen,"So in English, if I want to say 'I go for a walk on Mondays,' I don't put the 'the' on Monday. But in French, if I want to say 'I go for a walk on Mondays,' then I have to say 'le lundi,' not just 'lundi.'"
18,211,Lauren,Go for a walk on the Mondays.
18,212,Gretchen,Go for a walk the Monday. Singular.
18,213,Lauren,Okay. The Monday.
18,214,Gretchen,"Yeah, so it's like, even in languages that ostensibly have things that map to this category, figuring out how to use them slightly differently depending on the language is a rich and difficult area of of investigation."
18,215,Lauren,"So, we've established that it's not untranslatability, it's unable to translate into a single convenient word. And it's not untranslatability because it happens across Englishes, too..."
18,216,Gretchen,Mm-hmm.
18,217,Lauren,So what is happening here?
18,218,Gretchen,I think it's about -- there's two kinds of meaning that come with a word.
18,219,Lauren,Mm-hmm.
18,220,Gretchen,"There's the kind of one-sentence, easy-to-describe, dictionary sort of meaning."
18,221,Lauren,Yeah. Which is what we often think of as meaning.
18,222,Gretchen,"Yeah. And then there's all of the kind of surrounding context: the social context, and when you learned a word, and what it means to you, and these kinds of things. You know, I was coming across in one of these lists a word about, I think it was a Swedish type of coffee break."
18,223,Lauren,Fika!
18,224,Gretchen,Fika!
18,225,Lauren,It's a good one.
18,226,Gretchen,"And they were saying, 'Well in the Swedish coffee break you're not allowed to talk about work, and you must only talk about things that are not related to work.'"
18,227,Lauren,Uh-huh.
18,228,Gretchen,And I don't necessarily think that it is an intrinsic property of 'fika' as 'fika' specifically. I think this is a Swedish property of coffee breaks.
18,229,Lauren,Right.
18,230,Gretchen,"Like, I know what a coffee break is."
18,231,Lauren,"So it's conflating the coffee break and the -- oh, I always think, 'cause with fika it's about having coffee and food, I think of it as, like, 'let's do coffee'? You know, the act of doing coffee."
18,232,Gretchen,Yeah.
18,233,Lauren,That's what I think of fika as.
18,234,Gretchen,"Let's get coffee, or let's do coffee."
18,235,Lauren,Yeah.
18,236,Gretchen,Not just like you're sitting by yourself at your desk having sad desk coffee.
18,237,Lauren,"That is definitely not fika. I know that, and I'm not Swedish."
18,238,Gretchen,"But you know, the cultural things are like what you do at a coffee break, or, you know, if you talk about different -- I don't know, to go back to the school example, different recess traditions, or different school break traditions, like do you go out and play in the playground, or do you stay inside because it's very cold in Canada in the wintertime sometimes and they wouldn't let us outside, even with our toques."
18,239,Lauren,"So, now that we have the concepts of these two forms of meaning, do you want the jargon?"
18,240,Gretchen,"Yes, I'd like the jargon."
18,241,Lauren,"Okay. So the specific, to-the-point meaning -- dictionary meaning, more or less -- is 'denotation.' Which I always remember because denotation and dictionary start with the same letter."
18,242,Gretchen,Mm!
18,243,Lauren,And then connotation is all the context to the meaning. (Do you see what I did there?)
18,244,Gretchen,"Ah, good."
18,245,Lauren,So I'm gonna explain denotation and connotation using sandwiches.
18,246,Gretchen,Okay.
18,247,Lauren,"And of course we pulled sandwiches apart -- not literally, just semantically -- in a Patreon episode. But I want to come back to sandwiches and talk about a historical anecdote in my family that kind of explains where denotation and connotation are in tension. So as I've mentioned, my grandmother is an English second language speaker."
18,248,Gretchen,Mm-hmm.
18,249,Lauren,"I've mentioned it on the show before. She's a Polish and German native speaker, came to Australia, had to learn not only English, but also raise a family of very Anglo-educated children. So, my grandfather's English, they went to school in English, and they wanted to kind of fit in with the other kids. And so the denotation of a sandwich is very simple: it's two pieces of bread with filling between it."
18,250,Gretchen,Yep.
18,251,Lauren,"And my grandmother would send my mum and her siblings to school with sandwiches, but where my grandmother fell down was on the connotation of a sandwich, because my grandmother took the 'two pieces of bread with some kind of tasty filling' quite liberally."
18,252,Gretchen,Uh-oh!
18,253,Lauren,"There are stories of her sending my mum to school with butter and peanuts? Because she couldn't get the hang that peanut butter was a specific thing? Or sending them to school with -- and I've never tried this, personally -- but like chocolate biscuits in bread."
18,254,Gretchen,That's very interesting!
18,255,Lauren,And so this is completely violating the idea of what a sandwich -- what its connotation is. But she's still meeting the denotation of it.
18,256,Gretchen,"Yeah, I mean, I think in our sandwich episode she's passing the sandwich test with flying colours!"
18,257,Lauren,She's doing better than a burrito!
18,258,Gretchen,Yeah!
18,259,Lauren,Or a pierogi.
18,260,Gretchen,"Yeah, or a pizza or whatever. Like, she's got the the two pieces of bread, which is pretty key, and you could make a chocolate chip cookie sandwich..."
18,261,Lauren,"And so when we have these ideas of untranslatable words, we're trying to pull all the connotation along with the denotation. I mean, sometimes it's just denotation?"
18,262,Gretchen,Yeah.
18,263,Lauren,"And the denotation that it has cuts the world in a particular way our language doesn't, and that would be nice to have. But often we're trying to drag a lot of the connotation along as well, and I think that's why 'hygge' feels like such a complicated thing to bring into English, because we could just say it means cosiness, and we've kind of hit the denotation pretty well."
18,264,Gretchen,Yeah.
18,265,Lauren,"But we want to bring alllll of the Scandinavian knitwear, candles, prettiness in along with it."
18,266,Gretchen,"Yeah. And it's kind of aspirational, like, this is how it could be. There's a quote from Dinosaur Comics that I really like that expresses this. So they're talking about meanings of words and what's the opposite of various things, and T-Rex is getting more and more frustrated and says, 'Language is hard!' And the other character says, 'No, life is hard. Language is just how we talk about it.'"
18,267,Lauren,"Oh, that's so true. And it does -- these connotations make it really hard, they make it hard especially for machine translation, because machines can't weigh up all the different connotations of different words in a way that a translator can. And that's part of the skill of translation, is knowing what words to use that have the same connotations."
18,268,Gretchen,Mm-hmm.
18,269,Lauren,"You know, if you're translating a scene about someone at a market, then the word 'cheap' as opposed to 'inexpensive' -- something that's cheap has this connotation of inferior quality compared to using the word inexpensive."
18,270,Gretchen,"Yeah! Or 'a good deal,' you know, they could be the same thing, like a 'bargain.'"
18,271,Lauren,"Oh, yeah! Suddenly that's not only like -- it's like good cheap."
18,272,Gretchen,"'Wow, that's good cheap!' And, you know, 'bad cheap,' or 'inexpensive,' there's all these different levels there and --"
18,273,Lauren,"But words are connotation magnets. I mean, it's why we need euphemisms all the time, because as soon as we start using a word in a particular context, it just amasses all these connotations and they become either pejorative and negative and that's how slurs kind of get cycled through, which is not great, or they kind of make all these other cultural inferences."
18,274,Gretchen,"Yeah, and I think that one of the things that talking about words as 'untranslatable,' even though it can be satisfying to say, 'Oh wow, here's these new concepts!' or 'Here's the thing that I hadn't thought about in this way before,' in some respect, every word is untranslatable and yet we managed to learn them all anyway."
18,275,Lauren,Yeah.
18,276,Gretchen,"How do we learn any new word if no word has an exact equivalent somewhere? Well, you know, we live a life and we figure it out! And in many cases, the word side of translation is very easy. It's the grammar side and the aesthetic side that's a lot harder."
18,277,Lauren,"And all those connotations. I know when I learnt Nepali, I had to keep track of three different formality levels, which, like, I know how to be polite to different people to different extents in English, but suddenly I had to do it in another language and in the grammar, and I remember just knowing who to use which level of formality with was a whole set of translation that I took a long time to really feel comfortable with, so I would definitely agree that the kind of grammatical encoding of things adds a translation complication that can be quite hard to master."
18,278,Gretchen,"Yeah, and yet you don't see different forms of 'you' in 'difficult to translate' lists, even though maybe they should be there."
18,279,Lauren,We're gonna start our own very exciting list.
18,280,Gretchen,Let's make a 'difficult to translate for linguists' list! I'd be down for this! [Music]

19,1,Lauren,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics. I'm Lauren Gawne."
19,2,Gretchen,"And I'm Gretchen McCulloch, and today we're talking about when sentences come with baggage. But first, we have new merchandise for you!"
19,3,Lauren,Whoo! New merch!
19,4,Gretchen,"By very popular demand, we have scarves that have tree-structure diagrams on them -- they're very subtle, there are no words, there are no labels, so they can belong to whatever theoretical framework you're interested in, whether that's syntax trees, language family trees, syllable structure trees... They look really cool, we're really excited to see them around your necks."
19,5,Lauren,"We have them in grey, cream, light pink, teal, and red, and we've also taken the opportunity to add a few more colours that were requested to the IPA scarf lineup as well, so if you were thinking of getting an IPA scarf or one of our new tree scarves, we have some new colours. We also have new colours for some of the 'Not judging your grammar, just analysing it' zip bags and notebooks."
19,6,Gretchen,"And we also have a bunch of new items that say 'Heck yeah descriptivism' or 'Heck yeah language change,' because we couldn't pick, so if you want to be extra excited about linguistic descriptivism or language change, you can now do that. And if you want a black, grey, teal, or light pink IPA scarf with all your favourite characters from the International Phonetic Alphabet on them, you can get those too."

19,8,Gretchen,Just go to lingthusiasm.com/merch! [Music]
19,9,Gretchen,"I am really excited about this topic, because this gets to take me back five years to when I was obsessed with watching a YouTube series called The Lizzie Bennet Diaries."
19,10,Lauren,And I watched it entirely on your recommendation.
19,11,Gretchen,And it was good! Right?
19,12,Lauren,"And just for the sake of it, not because I wanted to be ready for our presupposition topic."
19,13,Gretchen,"No, I think I actually got our producer Claire into it before, and then she got you into it."
19,14,Lauren,Yeah.
19,15,Gretchen,"So, The Lizzie Bennet Diaries is not about linguistics, it's a YouTube adaptation of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice set in the modern day, and it has very little to do with linguistics, in fact, except for the fact that one of its episodes, episode 63, has this really good example of exactly what we're talking about in this episode. And I feel like watching this episode five years ago, when I was still in grad school, I had this moment when I was like, this is exactly what I have been learning about presuppositions for. So I want to act this out for you."
19,16,Lauren,Okay. Should we act it out together?
19,17,Gretchen,"Yeah, but I need to give a little bit of context first."
19,18,Lauren,Okay.
19,19,Gretchen,"So, if you know anything about the story of Pride and Prejudice, you know, spoiler alert! There's -- sorry, the book's really old!"
19,20,Lauren,"You've only had 200 years to read it, folks."
19,21,Gretchen,"So, where we are up until this point is Darcy has done the first really awkward proposal to Lizzie, and she has said, 'No, who are you kidding?' And then he has given her a letter where he explains himself, and because this is a YouTube vlog series, all of this has happened in the vlogs. And at this moment, Lizzie has read the letter, but she hasn't talked about it on the vlogs, because if you'll recall from the book, it has very, you know, kind of private and personal information about other people in the letter, so she doesn't feel like she can talk about it. And so at this moment, Caroline, who is Bingley's sister, who also probably has a thing for Darcy, has come over to Lizzie's videos and been like, 'Hey Lizzie, so, like, what's up?' And this is where our scene starts. Do you want to be Lizzie or Caroline?"
19,22,Lauren,I'm happy to be Caroline.
19,23,Gretchen,Okay.
19,24,Lauren,"It's all good. Like, I'm not going to deny you the opportunity to be Lizzie in a run-through of The Lizzie Bennett Diaries."
19,25,Gretchen,"I appreciate you, you're a good friend!"
19,26,Lauren,I'm not a monster!
19,27,Gretchen,"Caroline is also a great character, she causes all these, like, really interesting semantic moments in the story."
19,28,Lauren,I'm really happy to play the semantically integral character. Okay! Okay.
19,29,Gretchen,"All right! So, Lizzie says, 'You have been watching my videos!' Lauren (as Caroline): No, I haven't! That's why I need you to catch me up! Gretchen (as Lizzie): You've been watching my videos, and now you want to know what's in Darcy's letter. Lauren (as Caroline): No, I don't! Gretchen (as Lizzie): I believe an appropriate response would have been 'What letter?' Lauren (as herself again): Ooooh, busted! That's Lauren being scandalised, not Caroline being... busted..."
19,30,Gretchen,"Yeah, okay. Cut scene! We're back as ourselves. So what happens here, after the end of this scene -- Lauren, what do you think about Caroline's, like, video-having-watched state?"
19,31,Lauren,"Well, she's clearly busted, as I have declared, because the response should have been 'What letter?' There's this assumption that she knows about the letter, because she's not like, 'Aah! Take a step back, what are you talking about?'"
19,32,Gretchen,But she denied it! She's said no!
19,33,Lauren,"But she said, 'No, I don't know what's happening,' not 'no' to the earlier bit of information that is in the sentence."
19,34,Gretchen,"Yeah, like, 'No, I don't want to know what's in the letter. Oh wait, I still am presupposing that there's a letter.'"
19,35,Lauren,"Yeah, so the letter is just in there as baggage."
19,36,Gretchen,"Yeah, the letter gets brought along for the ride."
19,37,Lauren,Yep.
19,38,Gretchen,"And so this was really interesting to me because it's a very clear example from the situational context -- and of course Lizzie is not a linguist, but she's saying, 'I recognise that there was this extra meaning that I was bringing along that you shouldn't have been aware of.'"
19,39,Lauren,Lizzie is a natural linguist!
19,40,Gretchen,"She's a natural linguist! There's a similar type of thing that can happen -- the classic example of this nature is if I were to say to you, 'Hey Lauren, is the present king of France bald?'"
19,41,Lauren,"Ooh! Okay, let me think. Umm... let me think about who the present king of... hey, wait a minute!"
19,42,Gretchen,What just happened!
19,43,Lauren,"This is a trick question! Like, whether they're bald or not is not the relevant fact? The relevant fact is that there hasn't been a king of France since the revolution in 178... oh jeez, my history teacher is going to be very upset with me. 1789?"
19,44,Gretchen,That's probably right. I don't know.
19,45,Lauren,I'll check that.
19,46,Gretchen,"This is a very good Masterpiece Theatre! Yeah, so, the problem with that is again, it presupposes that there is a present king of France. In the way that if I said, 'Is the present Queen of England bald?' you know, you'd have a real answer to that question."
19,47,Lauren,"Oh! No, I think. It looks like her hair, but how do we know? But I feel like I'm definitely on firmer ground with that than asking about kings of France. This is a famous example because Bertrand Russell, who was a philosopher, it was one of his favourite sentences, he loved bringing this one out as a dinner party conversation piece to get people talking about how sentences come with all this additional information, and we kind of presume a whole bunch of knowledge and put it at the front."
19,48,Gretchen,"That sounds like a great dinner party topic of conversation, I'm going to do that now!"
19,49,Lauren,"Yeah, I teach undergraduate semantics on the theory that what you're doing is teaching people how to have really great anecdotes for parties."
19,50,Gretchen,I'm into it.
19,51,Lauren,"So, this is a famous one, it comes up when we're teaching this kind of thing, but it kind of comes from the philosophical tradition of understanding how meaning works? And it amuses me, because a lot of philosophers don't realise that a bunch of the time what they're doing is actually linguistics when they're doing kind of this language theory stuff. And it really just makes me happy that there are all these philosophers that think they're doing philosophy and it's like, 'You're all actually linguists! You just don't know it!'"
19,52,Gretchen,"Everything is linguistics! I think my favourite thing about presuppositions -- well, one of my many favourite things, in addition to the many jokes that rely on it -- which we're definitely going to get into! One of my favourite things is that one of the ways to spot a presupposition is the response that you need to have to a sentence that has a buried presupposition. So if you reply to, you know, 'Do you want to know what's in Darcy's letter?' and you say, 'Yes, I do,' that presupposes that Darcy wrote a letter. And if you say, 'No, I don't,' that still presupposes that Darcy wrote a letter. So if you want to not be Caroline and not get stuck, you have to say, 'What letter?' or 'Actually, I didn't know there was a letter,' or 'Hey, wait a minute! There was a letter?' And the 'hey, wait a minute!' one gets abbreviated HWAM. H-W-A-M. It's an acronym, okay. So it's the HWAM (pronounced aitch-wham) test. You're like, 'HWAM, there isn't any king of France!' 'HWAM, Darcy wrote a letter?!'"
19,53,Lauren,"Yeah, you need a little HWAM stamp to stamp on examples."
19,54,Gretchen,Yeah!
19,55,Lauren,Declare them as presuppositionably cancellable.
19,56,Gretchen,A little stamp you can stamp on someone's forehead when they make an unwarranted presupposition. HWAM!
19,57,Lauren,HWAM!
19,58,Gretchen,"You could tattoo it on your knuckles, it's got the right number of letters."
19,59,Lauren,"...yeah. I'm gonna stick with the rubber stamp, personally."
19,60,Gretchen,"I mean, it also just sounds like a superhero move: HWAM! Or, HWAM! There isn't a king of France! There you go."
19,61,Lauren,"Yeah. So this is a way of cancelling the presupposition. So the idea that Darcy wrote a letter is a presupposition, the idea there is a king of France is a presupposition. Instead of putting on some HWAM knuckledusters, maybe we can put on some lab coats, Gretchen."
19,62,Gretchen,"Okay, we can put our linguist lab coats on."
19,63,Lauren,"And try some more presupposition testing, because this is one of those great areas of linguistics where you can kind of prod at examples and see how they react and see whether you can cancel them. So if you have a 'hey wait a minute' reaction, that's a good indication that there is some kind of presupposition."
19,64,Gretchen,Okay. Do you have an example for us?
19,65,Lauren,"Well, we had the HWAM."
19,66,Gretchen,Okay.
19,67,Lauren,Another thing to do is to find a way that cancels it by bringing in additional information.
19,68,Gretchen,Okay.
19,69,Lauren,"So, 'the present king of France is bald' could be cancelled by saying, 'the present king of France is bald and also not recognised as a monarch because of the revolution.'"
19,70,Gretchen,"Oh, so there's some pretender, or some descendant that has set up a puppet court and claims to be the king of France."
19,71,Lauren,Yeah.
19,72,Gretchen,Mm!
19,73,Lauren,"One of my favourite presupposition cancellings is a really cheeky one because it's something that is so -- we don't even think of it as a presupposition, because it's so semantically wiped for us, but when we say 'good morning' --"
19,74,Gretchen,Ohh!
19,75,Lauren,"We say, 'Good morning!' And someone goes, 'No, it's not.' It's my favourite presupposition cancelling because that's the way you greet people, you just say 'good morning.' And it's more of a, like, 'I wish you a good morning' rather than 'you are having a good morning.' But, you know, someone says 'good morning' and you reply with, 'Actually, my boss was late and the coffee shop had run out of muffins' you're cancelling their presupposition of goodness in the morning."
19,76,Gretchen,I like it.
19,77,Lauren,"A slightly fancier test, but one that I think shows how complicated our presupposed knowledge is, is something that's called 'projecting' in the literature, which is where really complicated sentences, or more complicated sentences, can lead to really interesting presupposition carrying or cancelling. And I'll give you two examples sentences to think about, and then we'll talk through them, Lizzie Bennet-themed. So: 'Lizzie thinks that Darcy's brother is delightful' versus 'Lizzie said that Darcy's brother is delightful.'"
19,78,Gretchen,"So I think to the first one I have to go, 'Hey, wait a minute! I didn't know that Darcy had a brother!'"
19,79,Lauren,Yeah. But if Lizzie thinks that Darcy's brother is delightful --
19,80,Gretchen,"Maybe she just thinks Bingley's actually his brother, or something."
19,81,Lauren,"Maybe. Like, you can construct a reality in which you presuppose that Darcy has a brother. But if I said, 'Lizzie said that Darcy's brother is delightful...'"
19,82,Gretchen,"Yeah, then it doesn't matter if it's true or if I think it's not true, I'm not bothered by it, because I'm just like, well, now she's asserting that."
19,83,Lauren,"Yep. So because Lizzie said it, you go, 'Hey, wait a minute! Why would she say he has a brother? I didn't think he did.' She's saying it as some kind of, like, joke, or to throw me off-track, because it's what she says. But if if you report what she thinks, you're more likely to agree that the presupposition holds and that Darcy has a brother, or that you're misunderstanding something."
19,84,Gretchen,"Hmm. But if you have, like, 'Lizzie knows that Darcy's brother is delightful...'"
19,85,Lauren,I think what happens is that people just run this with all permutations of possible thinking/knowing/believing.
19,86,Gretchen,"Yeah, 'cause I think if I say, 'Lizzie knows that Darcy's brother is delightful,' that implies that I, the speaker who's saying the sentence --"
19,87,Lauren,Yeah.
19,88,Gretchen,-- now I also think that Darcy has a brother and that this brother is delightful.
19,89,Lauren,"Hey, wait a minute, Darcy doesn't have a brother!"
19,90,Gretchen,"When you first wrote these examples, I went in and changed them, because I was like, 'It has to be Darcy's sister, 'cause he doesn't have a brother.'"
19,91,Lauren,I can't believe you didn't trust me.
19,92,Gretchen,"And then I was like, 'Wait, wait, this is what you're trying to do.'"
19,93,Lauren,This is the point of the examples.
19,94,Gretchen,This is the point of these examples.
19,95,Lauren,"I feel sorry for people who don't know anything about Lizzie Bennet Diaries, or Pride and Prejudice, or Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, or Pride and Prejudice BBC, or Pride and Prejudice the film, because they're like, 'Yeah, Darcy might have a brother, whatever.'"
19,96,Gretchen,"Whatever, who cares. Yeah, if you don't know, The Lizzie Bennet Diaries is free, you can watch it on YouTube, it'll take... many hours."
19,97,Lauren,"Yeah. Okay, so that's some ways that we can kind of pick apart presuppositions, and we can see that they're quite complicated and slippery, and it's not always as easy immediately as, like, 'Whoa, what king of France?'"
19,98,Gretchen,"Yeah, they require certain amount of world knowledge as well."
19,99,Lauren,Yeah.
19,100,Gretchen,"Because oftentimes we accommodate a presupposition without even really thinking about it. Like, the king of France one gets us because that's part of world knowledge that there isn't a king of France."
19,101,Lauren,Yeah.
19,102,Gretchen,"But I'm sure if I said to some people, 'The president of Canada is bald,' people might be like, 'Oh, okay!' Wait a second, Canada has a prime minister!"
19,103,Lauren,"Oh, yeah, I didn't even pay attention to that."
19,104,Gretchen,"Yeah! We know a certain amount of whether France is a monarchy, because the French Revolution was a pretty big deal but --"
19,105,Lauren,It was a pretty big deal.
19,106,Gretchen,"-- in more subtle cases of world knowledge, you don't necessarily pick that kind of thing up."
19,107,Lauren,Yeah. Do you know what's really upsetting to me?
19,108,Gretchen,What's that?
19,109,Lauren,"Is that the 'is the present king of France bald' wouldn't have worked in the time that Pride and Prejudice was written, because it was written, like, a decade after the monarchy collapsed."
19,110,Gretchen,"Oh no! Then you have to say, like, 'Is the present king of France headless?' It's true, like, the day after."
19,111,Lauren,"'Is the present king of France Napoleon?' No, only recently. Because I was, like, it would have been so great if we could have had: 'Is the present King of France bald?' completely collapses now; at the time of Elizabeth and Darcy, totally would have held, but alas, no."
19,112,Gretchen,Ahh. So it still had this weird presupposition for them.
19,113,Lauren,We haven't had a present king of France for quite a while!
19,114,Gretchen,"But it's not just -- so, a lot of the examples we've been using so far have been with names of people and names of roles that people have, which is something that you can presuppose."
19,115,Lauren,Yeah.
19,116,Gretchen,"But you can also do it with other kinds of words, not just names. One example that I really like is somebody on Tumblr, quite a while back, because I was looking through my presuppositions tag, asked me if I could recommend my favourite etymological dictionary. Lauren, what's your favourite etymological dictionary?"
19,117,Lauren,"My favourite etymological -- this is, like, such a linguist question, isn't it? My favourite etymological dictionary. A dictionary that is just etymologies? I mean, obviously Etymonline."
19,118,Gretchen,But is it your favourite?
19,119,Lauren,"I mean, I said 'obviously' because it's like the only one."
19,120,Gretchen,I know!
19,121,Lauren,"I mean, the Oxford English Dictionary does some etymology, and some of the other ones..."
19,122,Gretchen,"They do some etymologies, but it's often behind a paywall."
19,123,Lauren,Yeah.
19,124,Gretchen,"Yeah, so when I replied to this at the time, I was like, 'Well, I don't have a favourite, I just have one. It's Etymonline, you should go read it.'"
19,125,Lauren,It's really nice to not have to make choices in life.
19,126,Gretchen,"You know, 'There's one that's online that's good that you should check.' Or I think maybe they asked 'some of your favourite etymological dictionaries'? And I was like, 'There's... there's just this one.' This was a joke that I used to play with my siblings, 'cause I'd be like, 'You're my favourite brother! You're my favourite sister!' when I was growing up. I only have one of each."
19,127,Lauren,"Yeah, it is a good -- it's like a top Mother's Day card: 'To my favourite mother.'"
19,128,Gretchen,"Yeah. If you actually have two mothers for some reason, that's really mean, but..."
19,129,Lauren,"Yeah, true."
19,130,Gretchen,"When you only have the one, it's just clever."
19,131,Lauren,"Your birth mother is sitting there crying while your stepmum is, like, really smug."
19,132,Gretchen,"Yeah, don't actually do this if you have multiple mothers."
19,133,Lauren,"Don't do this if you have more than one mother, but if you're conveniently single-mothered, as I am -- convenient for the sake of this joke -- that's pretty good."
19,134,Gretchen,Yeah! So you can pull the 'favourite X.'
19,135,Lauren,What's your favourite theory about how language determines thought?
19,136,Gretchen,It's my least favourite theory!
19,137,Lauren,Kind of backs you into a corner there.
19,138,Gretchen,"You know, if you're the only person in a race it's like, you came first in the marathon that I had in my backyard ten minutes ago! That no one else ran in!"
19,139,Lauren,Yeah.
19,140,Gretchen,But you came first! Good job!
19,141,Lauren,It's a good way to talk yourself up.
19,142,Gretchen,"Yeah. I'm my favourite person in my apartment right now, yeah! Motivational self-help talk for presuppositions!"
19,143,Lauren,Aww! There are other ways in which presuppositions are really just an excuse to talk about great strategies for irritating siblings. And one set of those is including the use of 'stop.'
19,144,Gretchen,Mmm.
19,145,Lauren,"So, the classic 'stop hitting yourself' presupposes that you chose to start hitting yourself."
19,146,Gretchen,So this is the classic thing where you go to your sibling and you make their own hand hit them?
19,147,Lauren,"You pick up someone else's hand and use it to hit them, which, like, makes -- I'm really glad that you also agree that this is the thing that you do."
19,148,Gretchen,"Oh yeah, very much!"
19,149,Lauren,"'Cause, like, I don't want to sound like the person that's the aggressive sibling."
19,150,Gretchen,"I mean, I obviously, personally never did this."
19,151,Lauren,"Mm-hmm, yes, it was your favourite younger brother who would do it all the time."
19,152,Gretchen,"I have witnessed this happening among hypothetical siblings that may or may not be mine. 'Stop hitting yourself' or you can be like, 'Stop hitting me!' and then you can try to bring the wrath of your parents down on the sibling, even if they weren't actually hitting you."
19,153,Lauren,"Or one that I get asked all the time, which is like, 'When did you stop eating meat?' As a vegetarian, it's a topic that I don't give much thought to, but other people are really interested in."
19,154,Gretchen,"Right, so if you've been vegetarian your entire life, then it's like, 'Well, I didn't stop because I didn't start.'"
19,155,Lauren,"Yeah, it presupposes --"
19,156,Gretchen,Have you?
19,157,Lauren,"See? There you go, you're really interested now, aren't you, in how long I've been a vegetarian."
19,158,Gretchen,"Ah, no. The other classic example of ones that assume an emotional valence towards a situation -- so if you have something like 'how are you coping with your thesis?'"
19,159,Lauren,Augh.
19,160,Gretchen,"You're like, 'Actually, I'm enjoying it!' or 'Actually, it's been going pretty well these days!'"
19,161,Lauren,"Ahh, I finished mine, like, five years ago and I still get an automatic twinge just hearing you ask that question. But yeah, there were times when --"
19,162,Gretchen,I thought you were gonna say you finished yours five years ago and people still ask you that question.
19,163,Lauren,"No. But people would ask you. And some months you'd be having a really good month, things were under control, and you'd be like, 'Well, I'm coping fine! It's all good.' But you can't ever ask this question, like, neutrally or positively, you have to presuppose that things aren't optimal because it's a stressful experience."
19,164,Gretchen,"I get asked this question about my hair, because I have very curly hair, and people say, 'How do you deal with your hair? How do you manage your hair?' And I'm like, excuse me! I like my hair, I resent that it has to be a thing to be dealt with!"
19,165,Lauren,'How do you deal with the burden of your hair?'
19,166,Gretchen,'How do you keep yourself from murdering your hair?' Like... no!
19,167,Lauren,"So, I think we've declared those as the Annoying Youngest Sibling paradigm of questions."
19,168,Gretchen,I think this fits very well with our overall Pride and Prejudice theme that has appeared for this episode.
19,169,Lauren,"Yup, yes. Definitely."
19,170,Gretchen,There are definitely some younger siblings in Pride and Prejudice!
19,171,Lauren,I'm gonna go out on a limb and say some annoying younger siblings in Pride and Prejudice.
19,172,Gretchen,I think that could be said!
19,173,Lauren,Yeah. So that's that set of that class of words.
19,174,Gretchen,"And there's also a set around the number of times you've been doing something. So if you say, you know, if someone else is getting up and going to the kitchen and you're like, 'I'll have some water, too!' It's like excuse me, I wasn't planning on bringing you water!"
19,175,Lauren,"'Oh, I'd love some of those biscuits if you're opening the packet!'"
19,176,Gretchen,"It's like, I wasn't... I wasn't opening that. Or, 'Since you're better at mowing the lawn, I'll just let you do it!'"
19,177,Lauren,Yeah. Presupposes that you're better at mowing the lawn.
19,178,Gretchen,Or just because I'm smarter than you doesn't mean that you couldn't do...
19,179,Lauren,That one you have to use with younger siblings all the time.
19,180,Gretchen,"Yeah, I mean, you're contractually obligated."
19,181,Lauren,"Yeah, so I guess they also fit in with the Annoying Youngest Sibling theme."
19,182,Gretchen,"I mean, older siblings -- I feel like I should admit as an oldest sibling -- can also, presumably, be annoying."
19,183,Lauren,I wouldn't know!
19,184,Gretchen,The other ones that I really like are questions like 'Why is Darcy such a jerk?'
19,185,Lauren,"I love that it's just like there's no question that he is a jerk, because we're getting straight to understanding the reason for it."
19,186,Gretchen,"Yeah, or, like, at the end of the book -- spoiler alert -- when Lizzie finally gets engaged to Darcy --"
19,187,Lauren,Whaaat!
19,188,Gretchen,'Why did you get engaged Darcy when he's such a jerk?'
19,189,Lauren,Yep.
19,190,Gretchen,"'Why would you want to get engaged to such a jerk?' presupposes that he's still acting in his, like, jerky behaviour from the beginning of the book."
19,191,Lauren,"Yeah. I think of 'why' questions as, like, if presupposition is about bringing baggage in, then using a 'why' question is about bringing really space-efficient baggage? Like you just fit so much baggage in so efficiently with a question presupposition."
19,192,Gretchen,"I think the most epic example of that that I found when I was researching this was a study from one of those, like, Psychology Today kind of journals, you know, pop science things, and the question that they had in their headline was 'Why do people want to eat babies?'"
19,193,Lauren,"Now, you messaged this to me with no context."
19,194,Gretchen,I'm sorry!
19,195,Lauren,And I really did not know how to answer that.
19,196,Gretchen,Sorry! I feel like I need to clear up for the record that I do not want to eat babies!
19,197,Lauren,"It's funny in retrospect now that I know that you were sending it to me for the episode, but why do people write headlines like 'Why do people want to eat babies?'"
19,198,Gretchen,"I mean, it got our attention!"
19,199,Lauren,Yeah.
19,200,Gretchen,"Unfortunately, I tried to click on the study, and the link was from ages ago and it doesn't work anymore."
19,201,Lauren,"Oh no, so we'll never know! We'll never know."
19,202,Gretchen,"So we'll never know. I think this refers to when you have a baby -- people do say this -- like, 'Oh, I just want to, like, omnomnom it all the way up!' and they kind of, like, nibble on it, but not with your teeth?!"
19,203,Lauren,"Oh, right."
19,204,Gretchen,I've seen people do this with babies.
19,205,Lauren,"Yeah, okay."
19,206,Gretchen,"But not in like a consuming-eat sort of way, just in like a 'making the mouth movements at' sort of way."
19,207,Lauren,Yeah.
19,208,Gretchen,"I hope this is the case, because I don't want to discover some sort of, like, weird thing that apparently is so well-known you can put it in a headline."
19,209,Lauren,"So the examples we've been giving might give you the impression that there's just a specific set of words that we use to construct presuppositions. And that's true, we have a Wikipedia article that has a list of words that trigger presupposition in this way, but it's not just specific words. It's also words in particular contexts."
19,210,Gretchen,"Yeah, absolutely. One of my favourite -- and by 'favourite' I mean least favourite -- examples of this is when certain parents, disproportionately male parents, get referred to as 'babysitting' when they're taking care of their own children."
19,211,Lauren,"Oh, this happened when -- and I'm not gonna link to any of them, because I refuse to do any of them dignity -- but there was a massive furore because when Serena Williams went back to playing tennis, her husband sat by the court looking after their child while she did her job."
19,212,Gretchen,Mm-hmm.
19,213,Lauren,"And everyone was like, 'Oh, it's so cute! He's babysitting while she goes back...' But it's like he's not babysitting, it's his own freakin' kid, what do you mean?"
19,214,Gretchen,Yeah!
19,215,Lauren,"'Babysitting' presupposes that you're looking after someone else's child, usually for some kind of financial gain."
19,216,Gretchen,"Yeah, exactly. And if it's your own child, like, hopefully your partner isn't paying you to look after your own child, that would be --"
19,217,Lauren,"That would be your own personal arrangement, whatever."
19,218,Gretchen,"But generally it's the case that people are taking care of their own children as co-parents and, you know, it gets referred to as babysitting."
19,219,Lauren,"Yeah. So in this case it's this word, babysitting, but used in a particular context presupposes something that doesn't quite gel with it."
19,220,Gretchen,"Yeah. The other example that we encounter a lot for this is when certain varieties of English, or varieties of a particular language, get referred to as 'having an accent,' or 'losing an accent,' or 'accented,' or 'accent-less,' which presupposes that there is some variety of English that isn't an accent. Everything's an accent."
19,221,Lauren,Yeah.
19,222,Gretchen,There isn't one neutral version of English that is the zero centre.
19,223,Lauren,"Even though our default assumption is that we're the ones that don't have an accent. Gretchen, you have an accent, but I don't."
19,224,Gretchen,"No, no, I'm the one that doesn't have an accent, you have an accent."
19,225,Lauren,"Ahh, what a pickle we've put ourselves in!"
19,226,Gretchen,"I really enjoy describing -- partly because you can sometimes do this to play with people's expectations, like if you're talking to somebody and you can tell that they think of themselves as, you know, 'Oh, I've got this very standard American accent or British accent' to be like, 'No, no, you're the accented one. Canadian English is just the normal one, I don't know what you're talking about.'"
19,227,Lauren,"Yeah, kind of flip their presupposition back on them."
19,228,Gretchen,"Yeah! But at the same time, I know that the accent that I have within Canadian English is considered 'less accented' than other varieties, so I don't wanna do that when it's not flipping the script."
19,229,Lauren,"We found some more great examples in the wild of presuppositions, but I'll let you decide which one you want to share first."
19,230,Gretchen,"So, the way that I found these is I did a search on Twitter for 'presupposition' and I filtered it by only people that I follow? And I went back, like, eight years to all these linguists that didn't know that their tweets from, like, 2011 --"
19,231,Lauren,Were gonna be used as --
19,232,Gretchen,"Where they were like, 'Huh, look at this example of a presupposition!' Because it turns out I haven't blogged about this very much."
19,233,Lauren,So thank you to linguists of Twitter.
19,234,Gretchen,"Thank you to linguists of Twitter. Thanks to Lynne Murphy, who tweeted not so long ago an example which went 'Which Americanisms make you wince?' This is from a British newspaper, which presupposes that some Americanisms make you wince, or similar examples like 'What are your linguistic pet peeves?' or 'Which words should be banished?' presupposes that some words should be banished and that people have linguistic pet peeves, when this is also something that is not necessary and is not something that should be presupposed."
19,235,Lauren,"Emily Bender on Twitter shared a quote and then kind of deconstructed the presupposition in it. The quote was: 'Given that ours is a scientific discipline, you must be careful to ground your argument in previous research.' And Emily Bender's like, 'Well, do they imagine that the disciplines outside the sciences don't ground their research in previous work?'"
19,236,Gretchen,Ooh!
19,237,Lauren,"That, like, anything that's not a hard science just fabricates things anew every time without any reference to what goes ahead?"
19,238,Gretchen,Time doesn't exist except for science-science!
19,239,Lauren,Yeah.
19,240,Gretchen,I don't know what you're talking about. The only area that has time is science. Humanities and social sciences just exist in this non-time-bound sphere.
19,241,Lauren,I feel like this is a good time to send people back to the episode about existing in time as a human.
19,242,Gretchen,"That's true, we did a solstice episode about existing in time. Possibly one of my favourite examples, which comes from a non-linguist, saying, 'As his name is not Biggest Bird, we are to understand that Sesame Street is home to at least one, perhaps more, truly immense, unseen birds.'"
19,243,Lauren,"I feel like so much of our discussion so far has been, like, wow, look at all this extra baggage you get and you don't realise it, and I feel like this person is just trying to shove more baggage in than is possible with this example."
19,244,Gretchen,"This is the equivalent of, like, sitting on your suitcase, trying to jam it close."
19,245,Lauren,How much more presupposition can I try and pretend is in this name?
19,246,Gretchen,"I mean, I think there's a genuine example beyond the facetious example where if you say something is bigger, it's implying that it's also not the biggest."
19,247,Lauren,"So, like, 'something's bigger than Texas' doesn't presuppose that there could be something that is even bigger again."
19,248,Gretchen,"Yeah, so it's a stretch, but it's a funny stretch. Or a more mundane example from Sherry Yong Chen on Twitter where she posted a photo of 'Welcome Back' on this sign of a neighbourhood pub? Which was clearly trying to presuppose that you had already been there, you know, so that they could welcome you back as like a 'we're part of a neighbourhood' sort of thing."
19,249,Lauren,"And I think it's worth taking -- like, we've been giving some very constructed examples and I think the reason that people keep coming back to the 'present king of France' example, et cetera, is that they're very clean and clinical and easy to dissect what's happening. But the reality is we use presupposition to get through conversation every day of our lives."
19,250,Gretchen,Absolutely.
19,251,Lauren,"You know, if we're talking about Emily Bender, you presuppose that that is the Emily Bender that we both know, or that will be locate-able in the show notes of the show, and if I had to say, every time, 'Emily Bender, who's a computational linguist, who you may know from Twitter,' like, that's just gonna get a very tedious conversation."
19,252,Gretchen,"Like, a person that I know who is a person!"
19,253,Lauren,Yeah.
19,254,Gretchen,Who's alive!
19,255,Lauren,"And if I had to stop you every time and be like, 'Whoa, you have a sister?' Like, that's gonna get tedious."
19,256,Gretchen,"Yeah, normally we're pretty seamless about this, especially introducing random family members, or introducing, you know, if I say, 'Oh, I can't chat with you right now, I've got to go pick up my dog from the vet,' you can accept that even if you don't know that I have a dog (I don't have a dog). But this is the example."
19,257,Lauren,"I was like, 'You have a dog?! This is news to me, Gretchen!'"
19,258,Gretchen,"You've been to my place, you've seen I don't have a dog!"
19,259,Lauren,"Yeah. But presupposition works in a way that it's like, conversation is busy. The fact that I have a dog is not the important thing, it's the fact that I can't talk to you right now, that's the important thing, so let's just go with it."
19,260,Gretchen,"Yeah, you just kind of quietly update your mental ledger for which bits of baggage are being hung on to."
19,261,Lauren,Yeah.
19,262,Gretchen,"A really interesting example of this comes from a Language Log post from a couple years ago by Julie Sedivy, and she talks about boasting through presuppositions?"
19,263,Lauren,Mmm!
19,264,Gretchen,"And she gives the example of a politician who was trying to find a way to integrate into his conversation, like, 'Look, I created 7 million jobs!' without saying 'I've created 7 million jobs and you all need to know about it.'"
19,265,Lauren,Yeah.
19,266,Gretchen,"And eventually what the advisers came to was to do that boast through presuppositions. So saying something like, 'The 7 million jobs we've created won't be much use if we can't find educated people to fill them. That's why I want to create a tax reduction for college tuition to help kids go to college to take those jobs.'"
19,267,Lauren,Yeah.
19,268,Gretchen,"And so you get the 7 million jobs in there, that we've created, but you don't have to say, 'We've created 7 million jobs! You should definitely believe us when we say this.'"
19,269,Lauren,"And it gives it, like, solidity, 'cause you're not jamming it in as new information, you're treating it -- and the sneaky thing about presuppositions is that they're in that part of the sentence that we treat as old information or existing information."
19,270,Gretchen,"Yeah, exactly. So in the comments on that post, there's a woman saying that she's found this to be really effective for introducing people to the idea that she's a lesbian, because she just says, you know, 'my wife.' 'Oh, my wife would kill me if I watched that new episode of Torchwood without her! Have you seen it?' And then people just have to add the 'my wife' to the background information, and she finds it's less confrontational, makes for an easier conversation, than saying 'I have a wife, how do you feel about that?'"
19,271,Lauren,"Yep, very handy."
19,272,Gretchen,"Yeah, so presuppositions can communicate things about social norms as well. And one really interesting example of how we seamlessly update our information via presuppositions comes from forensic linguistics, actually."
19,273,Lauren,"Oh, that's cool!"
19,274,Gretchen,"Yeah! So this is when you use linguistics in a courtroom to determine how people can give evidence and be asked questions and all sorts of things. And in this particular example -- so it's a study by a memory scientist called Elizabeth Loftus -- they show people videos of car crashes, and then they'd ask them questions about what they'd seen. Sometimes they'd ask them questions in two stages, or they'd ask them certain questions that had presuppositions in them. So they asked them, 'Do you remember seeing the stop sign?' people would be like, 'Yeah!' or 'Sure, maybe.' They answer 'yes' at a higher rate than the people who are asked 'Do you remember seeing a stop sign?' which is not a presupposition."
19,275,Lauren,Right.
19,276,Gretchen,"There is an updated version of the study that was recently done in French by a linguist who I know named Elizabeth Allyn Smith at the University of Quebec at Montreal. And so she made a video and played it for Montrealers which again, you know, showed a robbery. So she had them fill out a questionnaire. The first questionnaire was things like, 'Did you see a trash can?' or 'the yellow trash can' or 'the green trash can.' And the trash can was actually yellow."
19,277,Lauren,Yep.
19,278,Gretchen,"And then a week later she had them come in and say, 'What colour was the trash can?' and they could select green or yellow."
19,279,Lauren,Uh-huh.
19,280,Gretchen,"And so in the cases where -- so sometimes they got no extra presupposition information, sometimes they got the correct presupposition information, and sometimes they got incorrect presupposition information."
19,281,Lauren,Yeah.
19,282,Gretchen,"And she found that people would give the incorrect answer! They'd say it was green when it was actually yellow when they'd had this type of presupposition, but they did so at slightly different rates than the English speakers did in the same studies."
19,283,Lauren,Huh!
19,284,Gretchen,"So they were less likely to be influenced when you added true information, but they were more likely to be influenced when you added false information."
19,285,Lauren,Right.
19,286,Gretchen,"Than the English-speakers. And of course there's a bunch of stuff that could lead to this, and I think she's planning follow-up studies to figure out exactly which factors affected this, it might have been French or English, it might have been other differences in the paradigm of the study. But think about, like, some of this can even differ cross-linguistically how much you update the information that you think is in the world based on a presupposition."
19,287,Lauren,"Which has massive implications for how people are cross-examined in court, right?"
19,288,Gretchen,Absolutely.
19,289,Lauren,"Like if you squeeze a whole bunch of presuppositions into questions, you could potentially confuse people's ideas of what happened."
19,290,Gretchen,"And if you feed someone false information in presuppositions and they agree to it, and then they give false answers later and you can prove that they gave false answers, you can use that to discredit a witness."
19,291,Lauren,Mmm. That's... mean.
19,292,Gretchen,Who maybe was just doing what we do in conversation all the time. [Music]

19,296,Lauren,Stay lingthusiastic! [Music]
20,1,Gretchen,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics! I'm Gretchen McCulloch."
20,2,Lauren,"And I'm Lauren Gawne, and today we're talking about the two biggest and most dominant varieties of English in the global language landscape, I'm talking about Canadian and Australian English."
20,3,Gretchen,Obviously.
20,4,Lauren,"But first, we are in the latest issue of Babel zine, which is really exciting!"
20,5,Gretchen,"So Babel is a magazine about linguistics which you should totally check out if you haven't heard of it already. They do lots of fun linguistics content that's accessible for a general audience, we're big fans, and we're in their 'Meet the Professionals' series! So they did an interview with us about this very podcast!"
20,6,Lauren,"If you're listening to the show, you've already met us, but you can hear a little bit about how we got the show started and why we love doing it so much."
20,7,Gretchen,And you can see our faces!
20,8,Lauren,"Something you can't do on this podcast, that is true."
20,9,Gretchen,"Which is very exciting. We also announced our artist for the art goal that we hit on Patreon! So Lucy is gonna be doing art for us, and we linked to her art portfolio from our website and from Twitter, and it'll be in the show notes as well, you can see what that'll look like!"
20,10,Lauren,"We are really excited, as we mentioned in the Patreon episode, we'll be sharing progressive art updates and images of early sketches with our Patrons. They'll also be getting a high-res digital copy of the art when it's finished, and we'll be sharing it with everyone else as well in low-res."
20,11,Gretchen,"Yep! And we're making it available on various objects. I should say the art itself is not yet available, you can just see other stuff that she's done for other people."
20,12,Lauren,"Which is super cute, and we're super excited. We also have our most recent Patreon bonus episodes. We have one on the 'roses are red' and other poetry memes. I love a good poetry meme, and we discuss some of our favourite ones in that episode!"
20,13,Gretchen,"Roses are red, violets are blue... I started this poem before I knew what I was going to do."
20,14,Lauren,Good save.
20,15,Gretchen,We like this bonus and we hope you will too! Okay.
20,16,Lauren,"No. We have the power of editing, but... no."
20,17,Gretchen,"No, I don't think we're gonna edit that part."
20,18,Lauren,"We also have our most-most recent bonus episode, which is advice about grad school. If you're thinking of doing linguistics graduate research through a masters or a PhD or any other, really, because we talk about the differences between the Australian and North American models for that, so... there's a good grad school reminisce chat!"
20,19,Gretchen,"Yeah, so picking a school, whether you actually want to go, what kinds of things to take into consideration when you're trying to go, getting funding, and all sorts of things about the different systems. [Music]"
20,20,Lauren,"We were both very excited to get to sit down with Lynne Murphy's book, The Prodigal Tongue, and we both enjoyed reading it so much, and we realised we were messaging each other about the book and its content and that we should just chat instead, it's much nicer."
20,21,Gretchen,"So, The Prodigal Tongue is about US versus UK Englishes or UK versus US Englishes, depending on which country you bought the edition in."
20,22,Lauren,"Very clever, sneaky marketing tactic. What version did you read, out of curiosity?"
20,23,Gretchen,"I read what's probably best described as the Canadian version, because it has the UK interior and the US cover?"
20,24,Lauren,"Wow, what a combo."
20,25,Gretchen,"Because it was an advanced version that Lynne's publisher very kindly sent along to me a couple months in advance, I only read it a couple days before the book came out, because I've had other things to do..."
20,26,Lauren,You've had other book-related things.
20,27,Gretchen,"But I appreciated having it sit there, reminding me for those two months. Yeah! So I had this kind of combo, hybrid version which is the only one of its kind and I feel is a very poetic metaphor to the relationship that one has to a book like that when one is neither British nor American."
20,28,Lauren,"I read the British version because my Kindle is linked to British Amazon, that's the unexciting reason."
20,29,Gretchen,That's fair!
20,30,Lauren,"We spend our lives in Australia getting UK and US editions of things depending on what whim people were on when they set up the market, so it doesn't really bother me."
20,31,Gretchen,"Oh yeah, same thing, we got the UK versions of the first couple Harry Potter books, and then we got the American versions of the later ones?"
20,32,Lauren,"Oh, poor you."
20,33,Gretchen,I don't know what happened there.
20,34,Lauren,"So confusing! So, Lynne's book is focusing on what she calls the 'nationlects' of the US and Britain, which means that she focuses on what's considered 'standard' and 'normal' for those two varieties, and I don't think it's surprising that they're the focus of a lot of people's attention."
20,35,Gretchen,"Yeah, and especially when you think about what people have as their perception of a country from the outside, often what we have is that kind of export media, you know, like I see shows from the BBC, or I see stuff from NPR or big media conglomerates, which tend to over-represent this standardised accent, and under-represent regional dialects and class-based dialects and all sorts of other varieties within each country."
20,36,Lauren,There's also a lot of angst in the UK about American English and aspirations in the US about British English that are kind of different to the internal debates about specific varieties.
20,37,Gretchen,"Yeah, so there's a lot of tension there, and you definitely see that coming out in Lynne's book where she spends a lot of time very carefully and meticulously debunking a lot of these misconceptions people have about these different varieties."
20,38,Lauren,"So many amazingly bad and ill-researched conceptions! Remember, people, if you're wondering about whether a word is an Americanism, Etymonline is there and free and it will tell you."
20,39,Gretchen,"You can look stuff up! Language is knowable, it is look-up-able! You don't have to just make a random snap judgement, other people have done this research for you and you could look it up! Or just call Lynne. At the end of this book I just wanted to call Lynne and say, 'Okay, anytime I need to know this...'"
20,40,Lauren,I think Lynne would be a bit overworked if everyone had a direct line to her to ask advice.
20,41,Gretchen,"And tweet at her. She's pretty responsive on Twitter. And she's had this blog called Separated by a Common Language for many, many years where she talks about a lot of stuff with US versus UK English, especially because she's an American living in Britain, so she has this experience a lot."
20,42,Lauren,"I think the thing that I was reminded of and quite like about Lynne's book and the discussion of the different varieties, is that it's not the case that British English is the parent language and American English is this, like, offshoot teenage delinquent that's off doing its own thing. They're actually sister languages that have split from something that was older and around Shakespeare's time and has diverged into two different but equally placed varieties. And I think we kind of forget that that happens with dialects, we assume that British is older because it's in Britain, and that's not true."
20,43,Gretchen,"Yeah, but it kept changing after the Americans left, you know, after all the various waves of colonisers left the UK, the home dialect kept changing. And in some places, kept changing faster! I mean, I know this is true for French in France versus French in Canada. French in France has actually changed faster than French in Canada has, and I think this is often true for colonial languages, that they change faster in the cities of origin. So, yeah, there's there's stuff that's changed in both areas and they've been evolving in parallel."
20,44,Lauren,"But of course, neither of us are American or British English speakers. And what happens whenever I read a book like this is that I just get really excited whenever Australia gets mentioned. I'm like, 'Yes! There I am! Whoo! Represented!'"
20,45,Gretchen,"I got very excited both every time Australia was mentioned on your behalf, Lauren --"
20,46,Lauren,"Aww, thank you."
20,47,Gretchen,"-- and also every time Canada was mentioned, which was not very many times."
20,48,Lauren,"Every time Canada got mentioned I was like, 'Yes, Gretchen!' Shout out to our other World Englishes, some of whom we have very close affinity and affection for. Of course we talked about New Zealand and their super-cool, in- progress vowel shift that's happening during our vowel episode, so hello New Zealand, our next-door neighbours!"
20,49,Gretchen,Your next-door neighbours.
20,50,Lauren,My next-door neighbours.
20,51,Gretchen,"Yeah, and all other World Englishes -- Indian English, South African English, Singaporean English -- there are all sorts of varieties of English from other parts of the British Empire that were also influenced by colonisation and also developed separate and very interesting trajectories that we will definitely not be able to do justice to in this episode."
20,52,Lauren,"And I think it's very important to say they are all people's first language, it's not that Singaporean English is some kind of, like, language of convenience, it's the language that people grow up with, it's the variety that they speak every day, it has so many great imports from the local Chinese varieties and Malay, including my favourite word, 'chop,' which I'll link you to in the show notes, a very important piece of vocabulary missing from other English varieties. There are also international Englishes that are used in political and business contexts, EU English is known for being particularly quirky, I think."
20,53,Gretchen,"Yeah, English as a lingua franca, where it's everybody's second language like in Europe, or with the UN, and you have a whole room full of English speakers who have a way of communicating with each other that has fewer idioms and fewer of the things that are difficult for non-native speakers, and then when the native speaker walks into the room suddenly it's like they're the one that's having a hard time being understood because they've got this different access there. So there's a bunch of different ways that English can be used, and I think we thought that one of the things that would be very interesting to do with this episode is talk about how we personally fit into this kind of gap, or this kind of tension between US and UK English, when you're not in either of these and you see yourself in both."
20,54,Lauren,"Yeah. Yeah, definitely. A lot of the debates around British and American English, it's never that one of us are always on one side of that discussion or the other."
20,55,Gretchen,"Here's a question for you, Lauren. When you have to pick a drop-down menu language on a website --"
20,56,Lauren,Yeah?
20,57,Gretchen,"And you're given the choice between US or UK, which happens to me a lot ,which one do you pick?"
20,58,Lauren,"I pick UK, because I also have a preference for '-ise' endings and spelling colour with a 'u'. And we talked about this with the Vocal Fries a lot, about the kind of international spelling of English, so we'll link to that in the show notes 'cause I go on about it quite a bit. So, like, UK English is close enough for me, but that doesn't mean that all the lexical items and features of British English are also in my English."
20,59,Gretchen,"Yeah, I know. Sometimes I pick one and sometimes I pick the other, because I tend to have colour with a 'u' but also '-ize' slightly more often, but I'm not sure if I actually do that more often, or if I just started doing that because spellcheck kept trying to insist that I do..."
20,60,Lauren,"Yeah, and Lynne said in the book, it was quite interesting, how those kind of technological decisions where you have to put yourself in one of those baskets seems to actually be driving British English speakers heavily towards saying, 'We always use '-ise',' where it was in flux for, like, centuries before that."
20,61,Gretchen,"Yeah, so spellcheck kind of promotes this idea that there's this one way to do things, or this word is or isn't in your spellcheck. So do you want to tell us, Lauren, about what's your potted history of Australian English for those of us who don't know? What do people know when they're thinking about the history of Australian English?"
20,62,Lauren,"So Australia was, and still is, home to anywhere between 250 and 400 languages before British settlers arrived, and I think that's an important thing that we often forget, so let's start the history with first 40,000 years of settlement on country. And then in, well, before 1778, Cook came, figured out there was a bunch of habitable world, the UK needed a new colony because America was obviously no good to them anymore, and in 1778 the first settlers arrived, and then many, many more arrived, and this was the beginning of the Australian national identity that we know now. The thing about Australian English is that people often use the 'melting pot' analogy, where you had a lot of convicts but also some free settlers who came from various parts of the UK, so a lot of northern Britain, some Scottish, some Irish people, so you have this real mixture of people and backgrounds. And there's this thing called dialect levelling where it doesn't take very long for the children to kind of even all of that out and establish some kind of general accent. What's quite interesting is that there's quite a lack of accent diversity compared to places like the UK and the US, and that's largely because it wasn't long after those early colonies were started that you get things like radio and the telephone and media that means you get less of that accent drift that you get in places that were really, really isolated for sometimes centuries. And so we have accents that are mostly really broadly, to grossly oversimplify, accents based on class. So you have a broad accent that normally correlates with people in the country, you have a middle accent, and we used to have this really fancy accent that sounded like a British BBC presenter, but we don't really have that anymore. So I speak a fairly urban, well-educated variety of English. And that's how we got to here!"
20,63,Gretchen,"Okay, so I think I knew some of that, but I definitely didn't know so much how all the pieces fit together."
20,64,Lauren,"So, I feel like Canada has -- I always think of Canada as having a relatively similar story to Australia, just with a little bit more time depth and another giant nation just off the southern border."
20,65,Gretchen,"Yeah, there's definitely a certain amount of similarity. There were a pretty similar number of aboriginal languages first spoken in Canada before European settlers started arriving. The number that I able to find is 296 indigenous languages spoken, or formerly spoken, in the US and Canada combined, and the number for Canada that I'm able to find is over 70 currently spoken. So there's some sort of gap between how many were formerly spoken in Canada, but those statistics don't seem to be readily available."
20,66,Lauren,"I guess also the national boundary between the US and Canada is an arbitrary, post-colonisation exercise rather than anything that reflected the reality that was there before."
20,67,Gretchen,"Right, exactly, so there's a bunch of languages that are spoken across the border, so maybe more accurate to talk about them as a whole in terms of aboriginal languages. So the main thing that's responsible for the mainstream Canadian accent as we think of it and the reason that Canadian English sounds to a lot of people very similar to American English, is that a lot of European settlers in Ontario were originally United Empire Loyalists, who were people who, when the American Revolution happened, were like, 'No, we don't want no revolution.' And so they went across the border to what was then the British Territories in what's now Canada, and especially in what's now southern Ontario. And so a lot of them settled there, and they spoke very similarly to how their neighbours had in the US."
20,68,Lauren,Right.
20,69,Gretchen,"But they had a different ideological alignment to their neighbours in the south. And so when they were looking to linguistic models, they weren't looking to this kind of, like, Noah Webster spelling reform stuff, they were looking to, well, you know, let's import some more British subjects from the UK and keep going with this British thing to maintain this British ideology on Canada. But very similar to what happened in Australia, there was a kind of dialect levelling where kids tend to talk like the other kids on the playground. And so if you can get a founding population of those kids that talk a particular way, they'll still talk like each other, so at an oral level, the language still sounds very similar to what it is in the US, but at a spelling level, and in some cases at a word level, things get borrowed in from the UK as well."
20,70,Lauren,"Aw, kids doing good for the language once again."
20,71,Gretchen,"Yeah, so a lot of the settlers that headed west of Canada, you know, into the prairies and into British Columbia, they were often coming from Ontario, and so they brought that Ontario accent further West."
20,72,Lauren,"Right, it's not like Americans went north to Canada."
20,73,Gretchen,"No. Well, so Americans went north first -- well, proto-Americans, non-Americans -- went north to Ontario and then from there, people spread west."
20,74,Lauren,Right.
20,75,Gretchen,"So there's this very similar accent from Ontario, which is kind of in the middle of Canada, all the way towards the west -- although there are differences that are arising now, people are very keen on some of those more local differences, but east of that you have Quebec, which is where I live now, which had been settled by the French much earlier and was, you know, taken over by the British but there were still many French speakers there who were very keen to maintain their French, and you have Eastern Canadian provinces that were settled by the British earlier, before the Loyalists happened, as part of this whole -- you know, they could have become part of New England, almost."
20,76,Lauren,Yep.
20,77,Gretchen,"And it's important to me to not leave them out because I grew up in Nova Scotia, and there's a very different accent there."
20,78,Lauren,Right.
20,79,Gretchen,And it doesn't sound so much like the rest of Canada.
20,80,Lauren,Hmm!
20,81,Gretchen,"The Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and PEI accent kind of all sound pretty similar to each other."
20,82,Lauren,What's PEI?
20,83,Gretchen,"PEI is Prince Edward Island, sorry."
20,84,Lauren,That's okay.
20,85,Gretchen,"And then you have Newfoundland, which only joined Canada after World War II."
20,86,Lauren,Really?
20,87,Gretchen,"Yeah! Like, really recently. And so it has a very different cultural history, and it has the most distinct of the Canadian English accents."
20,88,Lauren,Mmm.
20,89,Gretchen,"Because it has a very different colonial history, and a very different settlement pattern, and was settled from different areas of the UK --"
20,90,Lauren,"Like, lots of Irish Gaelic speakers, right?"
20,91,Gretchen,Scottish Gaelic!
20,92,Lauren,"Scottish Gaelic. Sorry, wrong Gaelic."
20,93,Gretchen,"It's okay. So, there's Scottish Gaelic in Nova Scotia, especially in Cape Breton, not so much in Newfoundland, I think maybe some in Newfoundland? But in Nova Scotia it's like the second most Scottish Gaelic outside of actual Scotland, which is pretty cool."
20,94,Lauren,Yeah!
20,95,Gretchen,I learned a very little bit of Scottish Gaelic when I was a kid.
20,96,Lauren,"Actually, no, that's a lie, it is Irish Gaelic in Newfoundland, because that's what my friend Jill did her PhD thesis on."
20,97,Gretchen,"Oh, okay, so it's Irish Gaelic in Newfoundland, it's Scottish Gaelic in Nova Scotia, there we go. But yeah, so you have this very different -- like, the eastern part of Canada has more dialect diversity because it's been settled for longer and has a different kind of settlement pattern than what's happening in the centre and west portions. And then in the north, several of the territories have Inuit languages, Inuktitut and -- it's kind of what's called a sprachbund? It's a dialect continuum of a bunch of languages that are all understandable by the villages nearby, but not so understandable if you go too far away. So they're referred to as kind of a group of languages in the north, those are official languages in Nunavut and in the Northwest Territories. So there's lots of stuff going on. Canada has a national policy, officially, of English/French bilingualism, but then certain territories have native languages as official languages up there as well. So I think there's slightly less dialect homogeneity than Australia has, but there's still kind of a 'Canadian accent.'"
20,98,Lauren,"Yeah, there's sufficient time depth, there's like an extra century or two than what's happening in Australia. I think, you know, just thinking about those histories, those very similar histories, I think the thing that, like, as an outsider to the American-British English stone-throwing debates is that if people in Britain -- and people in Australia do this, too, get angry about American English taking over -- it's like, well, British English took over a lot, is essentially a giant colonial steamroller across large patches of the globe, and I just feel like you can't get angry about someone else flaunting their cultural and imperial dominance when that was your mode of operation for centuries."
20,99,Gretchen,But I think in terms of a modern citizen's life on the ground is that aligning yourself with a former colonial power can be a way of trying to resist a current one?
20,100,Lauren,Yeah!
20,101,Gretchen,"Of saying, 'Okay, I've got I've got a certain amount of identity, I've got a certain amount of distance from this or distinction from this, because at least I can choose my coloniser!' There's this interesting thing that happens with the last letter of the alphabet in Canadian English. So how would you say the last letter of the alphabet, Lauren?"
20,102,Lauren,It is 'zed' in my variety of English.
20,103,Gretchen,"So it's 'zed' for me as well, but for most young Canadian children it's 'zee,' because it rhymes in the alphabet song, and they get a lot of American children's TV programming."
20,104,Lauren,Yep.
20,105,Gretchen,So young kids will generally sing the alphabet song ending with 'zee.' And then at some point around teenagerhood --
20,106,Lauren,Yeah?
20,107,Gretchen,They'll switch to 'zed'!
20,108,Lauren,So you used to say 'zee' when you were a kid and you didn't think about it?
20,109,Gretchen,"Yeah! I didn't think about it. And now I'm like, 'Oh, I would never say 'zee,' that sounds so weird!' But it's because I switched just at the age when I was beginning to become conscious of, like, nationlects and nation states and countries having different identities like that."
20,110,Lauren,"I mean, I was definitely overtly educated to make sure I said 'zed' because 'zee' was wrong and American, and those two things were directly correlated."
20,111,Gretchen,"Yeah, I don't know if I was -- I know I was just exposed to it, and I was like, okay, which one's the Canadian one again? I'm gonna need to pick that one. And so I was told that 'zed' was Canadian, especially, and this was the one I needed to pick."
20,112,Lauren,Right.
20,113,Gretchen,And what's interesting is this has been happening for decades! So people who were kids in like the '60s and '70s said 'zee' at the time and switched to 'zed' when they grew up.
20,114,Lauren,"So if you were looking at Canadian English in the '60s you'd be like, 'Oh, the language is changing, the young people are saying 'zee.' In one generation, 'zed' will be dead, we can all move on.' And then they came back!"
20,115,Gretchen,"So it's been going on for a number of decades, and it shows no signs of stopping because all the adults that I know in Canada still say 'zed'!"
20,116,Lauren,"Okay, and it's not like a -- I feel like in Australia it's a very overt, top-down, like, 'don't say 'zee'', but it seems to be more people cluing into the Canadian-American distinction themselves."
20,117,Gretchen,"Yeah, and like there's a lot of Canadian identity because the US is right there and it's so big and it's always present, you don't get to, like, hide from it halfway around the world, no offence! A lot of Canadian identity is bound up in, like, not being the Americans."
20,118,Lauren,Right.
20,119,Gretchen,"And so, you know, we pick that as an explicitly Canadian option. But because Canadians often identify themselves with stuff that's very actually international, like, 'Oh, we use the metric system!' Like, so does the rest of the world! It's only the US that doesn't use the metric system."
20,120,Lauren,"Right, yeah, true."
20,121,Gretchen,"And so when Americans move to Canada, apparently this is one of the things that they'll change about their speech, they'll start saying 'zed,' because if they say 'zee,' Canadians will really remark on it."
20,122,Lauren,"One thing that Lynne's book reminded me of is it's always the smallest things that draw the most attention and become kind of symbols of identity and being part of a particular dialect group. She points out lots of really subtle things about grammar and things about the lexicon that people are actually kind of happy to have different and don't think that much about it unless they're specifically editors or something, but it is these few things like 'zee' versus 'zed' that people -- those are the hills that people choose to make their stand on. And you can tell that people are really into these particular discussions because they're often the things that appear on accent maps or lexical maps, especially those ones where you do a quiz and it tries to tell you where you're from. And they're almost always for the UK and the US."
20,123,Gretchen,"I'm so jealous of those quizzes, 'cause I take them anyway, because it's a language quiz, of course I'm going to do it! But then they just put me in some random weird spot in the US that of course doesn't mean anything to me, because I'm definitely not from there, and I just want someone to make one for Canada sometime."
20,124,Lauren,"We made those small maps for the Linguistics Roadshow quite a few years ago, and I mentioned the potato cake/potato scallop lexical variation one in our episode on speaking a single language because Australians really, really got into these maps that we made. There were ten, a bunch of them are about lexical differences, one of them is an accent difference where Adelaide is the only place that says /dans/ instead of /dæns/."
20,125,Gretchen,Huh!
20,126,Lauren,"And this is kind of a famous Adelaide variation. And people really, really got into it, because we always get stuck, you know, kind of being on the outside of these maps for other people."
20,127,Gretchen,"I said this to Bert Vaux, who is the the linguist who made the initial data set that was at the base of the New York Times dialect quiz that was very, very popular in the US, and he's also done some stuff with British English dialects, and he has this new American English dialects survey that people can do that gives you updated set of heat maps with new questions -- we'll link to that, because it's very cool."
20,128,Lauren,Yeah.
20,129,Gretchen,"But I have him on Facebook now, and so I said, 'Bert, your survey is great, but, like, are you ever gonna make a Canadian one of these? Because I'd really like to know!'"
20,130,Lauren,What'd he say?
20,131,Gretchen,"Well, he was like, 'Maybe.' So one of these days, I figure maybe if I put some pressure on him in the podcast, maybe he'll do it. I'll be very excited if I can do a survey and get a customised heat map of my dialect."
20,132,Lauren,"One of the other things I really enjoyed about Lynne's book, The Prodigal Tongue, is the chapter on things that are untranslatable between British and American English. So these are words that we all use, and we don't think that much about, and they're pretty common words, but it turns out they have really different meanings in both Britain and America. And I thought instead of --"
20,133,Gretchen,"I feel like we should put a caveat before saying 'untranslatable,' because we did do a whole episode about how untranslatability is, like, not a real thing."
20,134,Lauren,"This is true. She talks about this a bit, too. It's not that they're untranslatable, but it's the fact that they are untranslated and we all go about our lives not thinking about the fact that we're talking about the same-ish but slightly different things."
20,135,Gretchen,"I think the thing is that you can think you're translating something between it, like you can think, 'Oh, well, soup! Everyone knows what soup is, it's this hot, liquidy food thing that you eat out of a bowl that's savoury. That's a great definition of soup.' But there's actually differences between what people mean by a prototypical soup when they say soup in the UK versus the US."
20,136,Lauren,"Yeah, so instead of telling you what these things are, Gretchen, I thought we could quiz each other about what our prototypical idea of each of these things is. How's that sound?"
20,137,Gretchen,Okay. So... shall we start with soup?
20,138,Lauren,Let's start with soup! I'm hungry. What is your prototypical soup?
20,139,Gretchen,"I think it's like a chicken noodle soup? You know, it's got little bits of chicken in it and noodles, or maybe like a vegetable soup with little chopped up bits of vegetables in it? What's your prototypical soup?"
20,140,Lauren,"Yeah, a vegetable soup like a minestrone with maybe a bit of pasta, but lots of vegetables, and also lots of liquid. But also things like tomato soup, I'm totally fine with those being kind of standard soup for me."
20,141,Gretchen,"Yeah, so I think the thing that we're getting at is that the prototypical American soup is a brothy soup?"
20,142,Lauren,Yeah.
20,143,Gretchen,"So it has a clear liquid and then it has stuff floating in it, that's vegetables or meats or pasta or whatever. And a prototypical British soup is a pureed soup. So it's like a cream of mushroom, cream of chicken --"
20,144,Lauren,"Cream of mushroom is a soup, cream of corn is a soup, I think."
20,145,Gretchen,"Or it's a leek and potato soup that's pureed, or it's a tomato soup, or it's these kinds of pureed soups?"
20,146,Lauren,"Yeah, I guess that's true! While we're on the topic of food -- again this is one where I'm probably just showing my vegetarian-ness rather than any Australian-ness -- but: bacon. What is bacon? To you?"
20,147,Gretchen,Well! Let me meatsplain bacon to you.
20,148,Lauren,Okay.
20,149,Gretchen,"So for me, a prototypical bacon is the kind that's long and slender and has, like, streaks of meat and and fat in it."
20,150,Lauren,"Yeah! That's bacon, right?"
20,151,Gretchen,And then you can get back bacon.
20,152,Lauren,What's that?
20,153,Gretchen,"Which is like a pretty obscure, and I don't do it very much, back bacon is like a small pork chop, it's more oblong and doesn't have the streaks of fat."
20,154,Lauren,Right.
20,155,Gretchen,"But I don't really have it that often, bacon is generally just the streaky kind."
20,156,Lauren,"Okay. That is all I think of as bacon, I didn't know there was any other."
20,157,Gretchen,"Well, so the ironic thing is, is what Canadians call 'back bacon' is apparently what Americans call 'Canadian bacon.'"
20,158,Lauren,Oh!
20,159,Gretchen,"And I'm like excuse me, because we don't actually do that as a prototypical bacon in Canada, so I don't know where you got this idea!"
20,160,Lauren,You're spreading false prototype rumours!
20,161,Gretchen,"And apparently Brits call -- their prototypical bacon is what I would call back bacon, and then they have this other thing called 'streaky bacon,' which is my prototypical bacon."
20,162,Lauren,Yeah.
20,163,Gretchen,I think 'streaky bacon' is a totally clear and transparent name for it.
20,164,Lauren,Yes.
20,165,Gretchen,Because it does have little streaks.
20,166,Lauren,"But not necessary in Australian English, I think if you said you were making bacon and it wasn't that, a very tired Saturday morning person would be very upset with you."
20,167,Gretchen,"Yeah, I think so."
20,168,Lauren,"As it is I never cook anyone bacon, so I've never had to have this problem in the UK. One that Lynne talks about, and that I've also blogged about, so I'm, like, personally invested and was horrified to discover that people have another meaning for, is the word 'frown.' And specifically, Gretchen, where on your face would you point to if you were defining a frown for someone?"
20,169,Gretchen,The mouth...?
20,170,Lauren,"Okay, good. You are a correct and normal person. Because obviously I'm not prescriptive, but this is one of those times where I just literally can't -- I do not have the other semantic version in my head. The other version being --"
20,171,Gretchen,"I was really worried about the future of this podcast, Lauren, if we were gonna disagree about frown, like we may have had irreconcilable differences!"
20,172,Lauren,"No, it'd be fine as long as we're not ever unhappy with each other. In the UK, a frown is like when you furrow your eyebrows?"
20,173,Gretchen,What?
20,174,Lauren,And look super serious?
20,175,Gretchen,But that's what 'furrowing' your eyebrows is the word for!
20,176,Lauren,"And also, like, if you don't have 'frowned' for the opposite of a smile in your mouth, then what is it called when you do a sad-feeling face? Like, for me that's such a necessary, basic semantic --"
20,177,Gretchen,"If there's a 'pout,' maybe?"
20,178,Lauren,But 'pout' is like sad and annoying.
20,179,Gretchen,"'Cause when I do a sad-feeling face, I mean, like there's the exaggerated clown frown, that's like really, really frowny. But when I'm actually sad I don't actually make that face. Whereas I can see actually furrowing your brow - oh no, I've become a frown defender!"
20,180,Lauren,"No, Gretchen!"
20,181,Gretchen,"So, I encountered this too when it was raging its way around the linguistics blogosphere because, you know, I couldn't avoid it, and it explained for me something that had always confused me, which was -- there's some of these stats, you know those motivational quotes that go around, that are like, 'It takes 57 muscles to frown but only 16 muscles to smile.' I've probably got the numbers wrong, but they're probably fake numbers anyway."
20,182,Lauren,Yep.
20,183,Gretchen,"And I would look at those numbers and be like, but how can it take more muscles to frown, because when I frown my face is just relaxed?"
20,184,Lauren,"And I'm using exactly the same mouth muscles, anyway, like where are these other extra 40 muscles coming from?"
20,185,Gretchen,"But if you have the frown that means the furrowing of your brow, then it's a whole face activity, and it does take more muscles!"
20,186,Lauren,"I love that there were people on the flip side who are like, 'Oh my gosh, I now understand the 'turn that frown upside down!' saying, because I didn't understand, like, unfurrowing your eyebrows just looks really weird.'"
20,187,Gretchen,Is that just like raising your eyebrows really high like you're surprised?
20,188,Lauren,"So, everyone clearly lives happily and life goes on and no one thinks that much about it, and we can cope with these variations in the language."
20,189,Gretchen,"When it was going around initially, people were posting about it on social media, on their blogs, and you could see people raging in the comment sections being like, 'How have we been using this word for so long with these two different definitions and nobody's ever realised?!'"
20,190,Lauren,Yeah.
20,191,Gretchen,"That they were actually two different things. And it wasn't in some major dictionaries, and people were surprised."
20,192,Lauren,"Very confused. Yeah, I think it's also interesting, I think there's a little bit of a generational difference as well happening in Australia. I think older Australians may lean towards the UK eyebrow definition."
20,193,Gretchen,"Ohh, interesting."
20,194,Lauren,So there's some additional complexity happening beyond just the national level.
20,195,Gretchen,One of the things that I found very interesting about Lynne Murphy's book was talking about politeness and the use of the word 'please' in the British versus American context?
20,196,Lauren,"Oh my gosh, yes."
20,197,Gretchen,"So if you wanted to politely request that someone do something, like if you're in a shop and you're asking for a cup of coffee or something --"
20,198,Lauren,Yeah.
20,199,Gretchen,How do you ask that?
20,200,Lauren,"I... order coffee every single day, and now I can't remember. Um. 'Can I please get a flat white?' Is I think what I say?"
20,201,Gretchen,"So you don't say, 'Can I get a flat white?'"
20,202,Lauren,"No... um, I could say, 'Can I get a flat white, thanks?' Maybe that's what I say, maybe I say 'thanks' instead of 'please.'"
20,203,Gretchen,"Mmm. Uh-oh, we've broken the 'please' isogloss. Mine is kind of confounded, because these days when I order coffee I pretty much always order in French, because I'm doing it in Montreal. Well, in French, actually, I don't use 's'il vous plaît,' because it requires me to commit to whether I want to say 's'il vous plaît' or 's'il te plaît'?"
20,204,Lauren,Yeah.
20,205,Gretchen,"And I don't know whether or not I want to address someone formally or not, so I just avoid saying 'please' entirely."
20,206,Lauren,"Oh, we've talked about your anxiety about formal and informal French around Quebec, haven't we."
20,207,Gretchen,"Oh my gosh, it's so difficult. So instead, I just put like extra conditional on the verb? So instead of saying, like, 'Can I get a coffee?' I'll say, 'Could I get a coffee?' or like, 'Would I be able to get a coffee?' and I just put more stuff on the verb, because the longer it is, the more polite it is, basically."
20,208,Lauren,"Yeah, definitely."
20,209,Gretchen,"So Lynne did this really interesting interview on the Allusionist, which is another linguistics podcast, about whether or not people use the word 'please.' And I think the British story is that you need to say 'please' because it sounds polite, and if you don't do it you're not being polite, no matter how many things you add on to the verb or how many 'would""s and ""could""s and ""may I get' you put on the verb, you've got to say please or else it's rude."
20,210,Lauren,Yep.
20,211,Gretchen,"The American story is it's better to do stuff with the verb, because if you say 'please' it sounds like you're giving an explicit order, and it's better to try to minimise the imposition by trying to make the order less explicit. And so saying 'please' actually makes it seem like there's a bigger power differential, like 'please' is the thing that parents tell their kids to say to adults, it's not a thing that polite strangers who are adults with each other say to each other, because you're trying to minimise the imposition there."
20,212,Lauren,"Yeah, I think I definitely do a lot of like 'Would it be possible to get some water?'"
20,213,Gretchen,But it's something about that particular word that gets perceived as rude on the British side.
20,214,Lauren,"Like, it literally gets perceived as the opposite. Like, Americans aren't using it to be polite, and Brits are using it to be polite, and then they wonder why they find going to each other's countries weird. It's like 75% because 'please.'"
20,215,Gretchen,Because 'please'!
20,216,Lauren,Any last thoughts about Australian and Canadian English or Lynne's book?
20,217,Gretchen,"So, one of the weirdest things that I noticed when I live-tweeted the book -- I tweeted various photos of interesting sections --"
20,218,Lauren,We will link to that.
20,219,Gretchen,"-- that I found from The Prodigal Tongue, so we'll link to that, and one of the things that I noticed that was a very Canadian moment to me was -- so she has this passage about the metal."
20,220,Lauren,The stuff that we call tin foil but also call aluminium?
20,221,Gretchen,Yeah.
20,222,Lauren,In Australian English.
20,223,Gretchen,So you call it aluminium?
20,224,Lauren,Yep.
20,225,Gretchen,And how do you spell it?
20,226,Lauren,"It's got lots of 'm""s and ""u""s and it's got... like... a-l-u-m-i-n-i-u-m?"
20,227,Gretchen,"So the relevant thing is that in Canadian English we say ""aluminum,' but most Canadian spelling guides recommend to spell it as if it's 'aluminium.'"
20,228,Lauren,Ah!
20,229,Gretchen,"Because it inherited the British spelling, but the American pronunciation?"
20,230,Lauren,"Oh! You're just, like, keeping everyone happy!"
20,231,Gretchen,"It's just like a parable for Canada. In the meantime, we have this massive spelling/pronunciation mismatch."
20,232,Lauren,Yeah! It's almost like the cover of your lexicon is different to the content!

21,1,Lauren,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics! I'm Lauren Gawne, and I'm here today with Suzy Styles to talk about how the sounds of language might be connected to other sensations that you have. Welcome, Suzy!"
21,2,Suzy,"Hi, it's great to be here!"
21,3,Lauren,"It's so exciting to have you on the podcast. I should just say, straight up, we are doing some research together, which we're gonna talk about during the show, and I always have such a great time chatting to you every time that we're working that I wanted to share that, as we often like to do in Lingthusiasm, share the chats that we enjoy having so much with everyone else."
21,4,Suzy,"It's super exciting to be here, I'm delighted. I enjoy your podcast very much and also our chats together, so it's great to combine the two!"
21,5,Lauren,"Excellent, that's what I like to hear. One thing we always like to ask people straight up is: How did you get into linguistics?"
21,6,Suzy,"It's a bit of an interesting one! I think when I was a small child I was very much interested in language and words, and thought about being a writer but didn't really see how that was working with my interest in science. So I was sort of pursuing physics and chemistry and literature at the same time, and I couldn't sort of square the two away together, and when I was getting towards the end of high school I went and took on a research project where I went and worked with a particle accelerator for a month."
21,7,Lauren,That is cool.
21,8,Suzy,"So I was doing sort of nuclear physics of electron spin and all sorts of things like this, and I realised that I was deeply uninterested in the practical aspects of doing physics experiments and ran screaming to the humanities! Where on arriving at the ANU -- the Australian National University -- I discovered this class that was this, like, scientific approach to the language stuff that I'd always found delightful? So, Introduction to Linguistics? And I just fell in love. I haven't left since. So that was my grand introduction, it was the language stuff and the people stuff that I'd always found fascinating, but also a more scientific approach to the logic of the stuff that I loved."
21,9,Lauren,"So was there a week in that class, or was it literally week one where you were like, 'This is where I need to be'?"
21,10,Suzy,I read the prospectus and I was hooked.
21,11,Lauren,That's doubly impressive! In your day job you work at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore in the psychology department.
21,12,Suzy,Yes.
21,13,Lauren,So how did you get from studying undergraduate linguistics to ending up in a psych department?
21,14,Suzy,"So I made the transition from classical and formal linguistics, where I was interested in the history of words, to psycholinguistics after a long and detailed research project on the way that people used to use prepositions to talk about time in the Middle Ages in English. And I was very interested in seeing if I could see how the meanings of those words changed over time, but realised that when I was working with these old languages there were these gaps between one text and the next that were sometimes 600 years long, and that what I was missing was the transition from one person to another. And that's where meaning change I think really happens, when one community is shifting slightly in this small time scale. And so obviously the only way to study this was to work with babies, who are learning their words for the first time. So the transition happened when I moved across to the University of Oxford to work in the Oxford BabyLab, where we were investigating all sorts of things to do with how babies learn their words for the first time."
21,15,Lauren,"Not growing babies, studying babies."
21,16,Suzy,"Yes, we were investigating the way that living babies who would come into the lab for a visit would process the sounds of speech and how they were connecting up the meanings of different words together."
21,17,Lauren,"Cool! What was it like, going from studying medieval manuscripts to actual, real-life, tiny humans? It's a bit of an adjustment!"
21,18,Suzy,"It was fabulous. Again, it was moving from a more theoretical to a more people-oriented practice, which I sort of see coming back again and again in my work every time I get hyper-theoretical, I come back to people and I find them far more interesting."
21,19,Lauren,So what were you studying the babies for in Oxford?
21,20,Suzy,"So, this was my PhD research, and what I was working on was how babies connect up the different items in their growing lexicon. So when a baby learns one or ten or twenty different words, what we're curious about is when they start to have, in the organisation of their lexicon, when they start to organise those words according to what they mean or how they go together."
21,21,Lauren,Okay.
21,22,Suzy,"So we could imagine one child is learning a word like 'cat,' and a word like 'table,' and a word like 'dog.'"
21,23,Lauren,Yeah.
21,24,Suzy,"And for most adults the words 'cat' and 'dog' go together in a way that 'cat' and 'table' do not. But similarly, if the same child is learning 'cat' and 'table' and 'car' -- the cat and the car share something that they don't share with the table. So there's a sound-based relationship and a meaning-based relationship. So we were working on a method called 'priming,' where what we're able to do is see whether children can understand the meaning of one word slightly more quickly if they've just heard another word that's related to that one."
21,25,Lauren,Okay. How would you prime me if I was an infant learning?
21,26,Suzy,So what I might do is I might give you a picture-finding task.
21,27,Lauren,Okay.
21,28,Suzy,So I'm going to put on the screen in front of you a picture of a cat and a boat.
21,29,Lauren,Right.
21,30,Suzy,"And your job is going to be to find the cat. And so before I say the word 'cat,' I give you just some language that's completely unrelated to the task."
21,31,Lauren,Okay.
21,32,Suzy,So it might go something like this: 'Yesterday I saw a dog. Cat!' And then the pictures appear.
21,33,Lauren,"Oh, okay! That was very sudden, I was just sitting here looking at a screen and suddenly there's dogs and cats and..."
21,34,Suzy,"Yeah. So what we found in those studies is between the age of one-and-a-half and two years of age, children get faster at finding the named picture if it was preceded by a word that's related to it."
21,35,Lauren,Okay.
21,36,Suzy,"Compared to if we had a different condition where we said, 'Yesterday I ate an apple. Cat!'"
21,37,Lauren,"Right, yeah."
21,38,Suzy,Yeah.
21,39,Lauren,Talking about eating an apple does not prime me to think about cats at all.
21,40,Suzy,"Right. So we found very reliable evidence, and this effect has been replicated a couple of different times in a couple of different age groups, and the method of priming in early childhood is now being used for all sorts of different aspects of the way that children connect up their lexicons."
21,41,Lauren,"Okay! So, learning words is a complicated task and we sometimes draw on meaning and we sometimes draw a bit on sound as well."
21,42,Suzy,"Yeah! But it's interesting that at the very early stages of development we see the same organisational properties for how those words work together as we see in adults. So the structure is there right from the start, and that's really exciting."
21,43,Lauren,"I think it's worth, like, always making clear in these things that the kids are hearing these sentences long before they can clearly say, 'Yesterday, I saw a cat.' You know, they're probably not saying it quite that sophisticatedly."
21,44,Suzy,Yeah.
21,45,Lauren,But being able to comprehend things always outstrips production in these things.
21,46,Suzy,"Yes. And for our one-and-a-half-year-olds, it was clear that although they understood almost all of the words in the test, they were saying very few of them at that stage. And yet we were still seeing this evidence from the way that they moved their eyes while they were looking for these pictures that even in comprehension, the connections between the words were doing some of the heavy lifting for them, not just one word on its own."
21,47,Lauren,"Right. I'm always torn between being like, 'Oh my gosh, kids are so clever!' and 'Oh my gosh, they're so stupid. They can't even say a whole sentence yet!' But it is pretty impressive And so you use gaze tracking to test those?"
21,48,Suzy,"Yeah, this was still in the old days where the only way to do gaze tracking was, realistically, to record the children's eye movements using a video camera, and then go through an exquisitely laborious process of coding the videos one frame at a time."
21,49,Lauren,"Okay! But now we have eye-tracking that's like a machine you can use that does it all for you, right?"
21,50,Suzy,"Yeah, so, the latest wave of eye-trackers are exciting pieces of equipment that use a small infrared light, and they look like an ordinary computer monitor except at the bottom there's a strip that contains a couple of cameras and some little infrared lights that flash, and what they do is they flash their little light onto the baby's eyes and you can track the reflection of that light to figure out where the baby is looking at any point in time."
21,51,Lauren,That is very clever!
21,52,Suzy,Mm-hmm!
21,53,Lauren,And a lot easier to work with.
21,54,Suzy,"Yes, indeed. It speeds up the process enormously."
21,55,Lauren,Fabulous. And so from there... so we went with words and what they mean --
21,56,Suzy,Mmm.
21,57,Lauren,But that's not quite what you're working on at the moment. So where did we go from there?
21,58,Suzy,So I guess one of the things that I was very aware of in Oxford was that the vast majority of babies that lived in our region were English-only babies.
21,59,Lauren,Right.
21,60,Suzy,"And while people who are listening to this podcast might come from communities where that's the norm, when we look at the whole globe at once, the majority of babies grow up with more than one language in their household."
21,61,Lauren,Mm-hmm.
21,62,Suzy,And probably several.
21,63,Lauren,Yeah.
21,64,Suzy,"So being monolingual is actually a bit abnormal, and we sometimes use the acronym WEIRD to describe this, where the letters all stand for something. So most of the evidence about most of the languages that have ever been investigated comes from countries that are 'Western, Educated, Industrialised, Rich,' and the 'D' stands for 'Democratic,' but I think mainly to make the word nice."
21,65,Lauren,"WEIRD, yep."
21,66,Suzy,"So when we talk about WEIRDs, what we mean is that everything we think we know about how humans operate is usually biased by this small subsample of languages and research contexts."
21,67,Lauren,"Yes. I think I probably learnt this acronym from you, because coming from a language documentation perspective, very few of my immediate colleagues and people who trained me work with English speakers or work in this WEIRD paradigm, and so -- we'll talk about the work we did in a minute -- but when I came to you, I was like, 'Well, obviously I'm gonna do it with this group of people in Nepal who I work with,' and you were like, 'Whoa! That's not very usual to get to do this kind of psychology work!' And I was like, 'Well, who else am I gonna...?' Like, obviously I have a question about this group of people, and I just thought it was normal that you would ask research questions about not just English speakers, but apparently it's a thing people are trying to get the hang of."
21,68,Suzy,"Yeah, I think it's mainly -- for people who work in psycholinguistics, it's an access problem."
21,69,Lauren,Right.
21,70,Suzy,"So because the equipment that we use and the laboratory settings that we use are often very tightly controlled, the people that we work with are the people who live in the nearby environment who can pop in for a visit. Which is not really going to be the same as linguistic fieldwork where you go out to where people speak a different language."
21,71,Lauren,Yeah.
21,72,Suzy,"So in my transition between these worlds, when I was looking at the groups of people who lived around Oxford, there were lots of people who were growing up in bilingual households, but each bi- or multilingual household was unique and different from the ones around it. And I saw this fabulous opportunity to look at what was going on in Singapore, which is a country that has four official languages and more varieties of language that are spoken in the home, and it's perfectly normal for the vast majority of the population to be growing up in a family that is many generations multilingual."
21,73,Lauren,"Everywhere around you, you never forget that there are other languages. Like, all of the information on the train is in the four official languages, there's always other things, like lots of TV channels that aren't just in English, it's kind of just a normal part of life, and you are weird if you're a monolingual."
21,74,Suzy,"Mmm! Yeah, so making the transition over towards Singapore, I was asking myself these questions about what are the things we don't yet know about the process of being bi- or a multilingual. And there are a few labs that are investigating the development of babies in bi- and multilingual communities, most of the work that's currently being done tends to be in very early childhood, focusing on the way that babies' hearing develops in line with the languages that they hear around them when they're very young."
21,75,Lauren,"And we've talked about that in a couple of episodes. We introduced people to the very sophisticated, actually very serious methodology of high-amplitude sucking in an earlier episode, and we've talked a little bit about it with vowels as well, how people acquire, well before they're even aware that their brain is doing this, the kind of sound set that their language has."
21,76,Suzy,"Mmm. So I guess what I was interested in is thinking beyond just the sound system on its own and asking myself this question of whether the sound system changes cause other changes as well. So what I mean by that is, if children over the second half of their first year of life change the way that their brain is representing acoustic information so that it forms up neatly into categories that are aligned with the adults from their speech community, if that change is going on at a very deep level in the auditory cortex, then maybe the way they process other sensations is also influenced by the way that their hearing is changing."
21,77,Lauren,"Right. So we have the brain kind of going, 'These are the sounds you've been hearing, these are the sounds in the language,' kind of re-molding itself to fit that. And then there is some relationship between how humans think about the sounds that they hear and other senses that could vary because of that brain re-organising."
21,78,Suzy,"Mmm! So I'm very interested in the idea of multi-sensory processing. And this is the idea that when we hear some sounds in the world, they kind of go better with some visual kinds of information than others. Or they go better with some objects in the world than others, and we know this and we learn this as children at a very deep level, these relationships exist in the world outside us, and where we can be aware of those kinds of relationships. So, would you like me to give you an example?"
21,79,Lauren,Okay!
21,80,Suzy,"Okay! So if I ask our listeners to imagine for a moment that I'm holding in my hand a staple and I'm going to drop it on a hard table, I think all of us can imagine the kind of noise that that staple is going to make when it makes contact with the table."
21,81,Lauren,Mm-hmm.
21,82,Suzy,"So to describe its acoustic features: it's going to be a high frequency sound, so it's going to have high pitch elements, it's going to be quite quiet, and it's going to be quite short-lasting. So tkt-tkt-tkt-tkt-tkt, something like that."
21,83,Lauren,Mm-hmm.
21,84,Suzy,Now if you imagine that I drop the stapler... you can already --
21,85,Lauren,That's going to make a very different sound!
21,86,Suzy,"Yeah, it's gonna make a very different sound!"
21,87,Lauren,I might come and ask what you're doing with my stapler!
21,88,Suzy,"Yeah! But the properties that are going to be different here are there are going to be more low-frequency elements in the sound, it's going to be lower pitched, it's going to be louder."
21,89,Lauren,Yes.
21,90,Suzy,And it's going to be a longer-lasting sound.
21,91,Lauren,Mm-hmm.
21,92,Suzy,"So what we've got already is this idea that for objects in the world that are small, the sounds that go along with them are going to be high-frequency, quiet, and short-lasting."
21,93,Lauren,Okay. Like a small dog is gonna yap and a big dog is gonna bark is the kind of perception that we have.
21,94,Suzy,"Yeah! And if we extend that even wider in the animal kingdom, we can think about elephants and mosquitoes."
21,95,Lauren,"That is a lot wider, yeah!"
21,96,Suzy,Yeah.
21,97,Lauren,Imagine a world in which mosquitoes made the noise of elephants and elephants made the noise of mosquitoes. That would be amazing.
21,98,Suzy,"Right, and we can make, actually, a very clean prediction about this. If we grew up in a world where that were the case, we would expect babies to learn that really, really early on."
21,99,Lauren,Mm-hmm! 'Cause you'd want to stay out of the way of those high-buzzing elephants.
21,100,Suzy,"Yeah, and in fact there's a very good evolutionary story that suggests that if a brain can make these connections, or is possibly even born with these connections, then it has a higher chance of surviving in the world."
21,101,Lauren,Right.
21,102,Suzy,Even frogs seem to know about this kind of relationship.
21,103,Lauren,Is that why they all pretend to be bigger by having really big voices?
21,104,Suzy,"Yeah, it seems that lady frogs find that very appealing in a gentleman frog."
21,105,Lauren,Right. So gentlemen frogs have figured out the game.
21,106,Suzy,"Yeah! So once we know about this relationship, and we know that hearing is connected to vision in a way that makes sense in the world, when we think about the baby side and we know that babies are learning about the sound patterns in their world, if the sound pattern in one language is different from another, maybe it influences the way that the sounds are connected to other sensory pieces of information."
21,107,Lauren,"Okay, so this is kind of getting into the idea that -- because in linguistics we spend a lot of time teaching adults -- undergraduates, whoever -- but we teach people that words are arbitrary, is the fancy terminology we use, but, like, there's no reason why 'dog' should be 'dog,' it could be any other combination of sounds, it is other combinations of sounds in all the world's languages."
21,108,Suzy,Mm.
21,109,Lauren,"But what you're saying is because we inevitably can never separate language from the physical world in which we speak it, perhaps that is not as entirely arbitrary as all that, that there might be some patterns happening."
21,110,Suzy,"So yeah, at the very most basic level, there's an idea that some sounds in language might go better with some meanings, or some other sensory experiences in the world."
21,111,Lauren,"Okay, yep."
21,112,Suzy,So the classic test for this is known as the bouba/kiki test.
21,113,Lauren,Should we do the test?
21,114,Suzy,"Yeah, let's do the test."
21,115,Lauren,"Okay, excellent. It's time for some podcast experimenting. Get your lab coats on, people! You're gonna do some science."
21,116,Suzy,"Fantastic. So what I would like our listeners to do today is first of all to imagine in their mind a shape that is really angular and pointy around the edges. So a nice, sharp shape. And I'm now I'm going to describe a second shape, and this shape is going to be very curvy and rounded around the edges."
21,117,Lauren,"If you have no imagination, we'll have pictures of both of these images in the show notes. You can go look at those while you're hearing about them and deciding what -- so, what do we do next with these two shapes?"
21,118,Suzy,"Okay, so we've got two shapes in mind and now I'm going to introduce you to two names for these shapes."
21,119,Lauren,Okay.
21,120,Suzy,And each of you individually can just make up your own mind which label you think is a better name for which of the shapes.
21,121,Lauren,Okay.
21,122,Suzy,"So we've got two shapes, one spiky one, one curvy one."
21,123,Lauren,And I'm gonna name my shapes.
21,124,Suzy,Yes. So! The first name is 'maluma.' The second name is 'takete.'
21,125,Lauren,"Okay. I'm gonna tell you what name I gave to each of my shapes, and you can decide if your description matches or if it doesn't. So our blobby, roundy thing, that's called 'maluma.' And our spiky thing, that's called 'takete.'"
21,126,Suzy,And that's the way they feel for you?
21,127,Lauren,"That's how they feel for me, that makes sense. In some way."
21,128,Suzy,Okay.
21,129,Lauren,"Totally spontaneous response here, I have not done this test 100 times."
21,130,Suzy,Perhaps our listeners could tell us via Twitter whether or not their sensory perceptions agreed?
21,131,Lauren,"And if you disagree, I mean if you agreed with me, please let me know, for validation. If you didn't agree, you can also let us know."
21,132,Suzy,We can also put it in as a little Twitter quiz to go alongside.
21,133,Lauren,"Oh, yeah, we'll have a Twitter quiz, that'll be fun. Yeah."
21,134,Suzy,So the answer that Lauren has just given us is the answer that 90% of people give when they're given this task. 90%! This is one of the strongest effects that has ever been documented in the field of psychology or possibly linguistics.
21,135,Lauren,Huh!
21,136,Suzy,"Where almost everyone agrees on the same direction of the match. It's incredibly powerful. This effect has been known for almost a hundred years, and it's been replicated many, many times and in lots of different languages and in lots of different contexts. So this bouba/kiki effect, as it's now known, is considered to be something that is universal."
21,137,Lauren,Except... we... broke it?
21,138,Suzy,"Yeah, this is the point where we get to ask this fabulous question that says if the sounds that we learn as children are different from each other, do effects like the bouba/kiki effect really apply, or were all of those replications over nearly a hundred years, were they all biased by being tested on WEIRD populations, not non-WEIRD ones?"
21,139,Lauren,"So, I heard you talking about this stuff in -- I don't even think it was in a seminar, I think we were just out to lunch with people, and you were telling them how you were looking at bouba and kiki, starting to look at it in children, but you were also looking at how it relates to Mandarin tone (and we'll talk about that)."
21,140,Suzy,Mm.
21,141,Lauren,"I kind of came to you and said, 'I'm working with this other tone language called Syuba in Nepal, it's got Tibetan tone, there's two tones, and I think people have a different idea about what's a high tone and what's a low tone to how I conceptualise it,' and that's how we hit upon doing this study together, looking at the relationship between tone and other senses. But we had to do a kiki/bouba first just to check, because it's universal. We wanted to make sure that our participants were doing what everyone else did. And then I wrote to you after we ran the experiment in Nepal and I was like, ""It didn't work? I thought this was meant to be the easy part of the experiment!' Something went wrong!"
21,142,Suzy,"It was deeply mysterious! Everything in the literature on this effect shows that it's highly replicable, it keeps happening over and over again, and it seemed, at the time, not to matter what language you went to; everyone showed the same effect. So we went back and looked at the literature and thought, 'Is there anything we've missed?' And there was one paper. Just one! A glorious paper from 1975."
21,143,Lauren,"It's, like, one page long, right?"
21,144,Suzy,"Yeah, it's only about 350 words! And it was another fieldwork study with a group of people living in a remote community, this time in Papua New Guinea rather than Nepal, which is where Lauren you went to."
21,145,Lauren,Yeah.
21,146,Suzy,"So we tried to figure out whether there was anything that was similar about what we'd done in Nepal and what this other paper from 1975 had shown in Papua New Guinea. So we sort of scratched our heads a bit and tried to figure it out, and then Lauren, I think it was your analysis of the words we put together --"
21,147,Lauren,Yeah.
21,148,Suzy,-- that helped us solve the problem.
21,149,Lauren,"So we used 'kiki' and 'booboo' as, like, close enough because there's not that o-u, /ou/ kind of sound in the language, and I said, you know, these are perfectly fine, and I could get someone to say them, but they're not good words in the language. Like, these sounds all exist, but you wouldn't have this 'kiki' sound in the middle of a word."
21,150,Suzy,Mmm.
21,151,Lauren,"And the tone doesn't quite work like that, tone works a bit differently to how it was structured to make the words sound like 'kiki' and 'booboo.' And we realized that even though we tried to make it exactly the same words as the other versions of the test, that had actually been the problem, is that these weren't words in the language. And from what we can tell, people were so mystified by this weird sound. It would be like giving English speakers, like, /ŋy/ as a word. You'd be like, 'Oh, it kind of sounds a bit like a word, but not a very good one.' And it kind of breaks your ability to do this kiki/bouba to shape thing."
21,152,Suzy,"So yeah, we suddenly come across this idea that if the combination of sounds that you stick together is not really word-y..."
21,153,Lauren,That's the very scientific term we used in the paper.
21,154,Suzy,"Indeed. Our 'word wordy-ness,' I believe we called it. Yeah! So if your sound set of sounds together is not really word-y, then you lose the ability to do all of those things that we normally do with words. So it makes it harder for us to learn words, and it makes it harder for us to remember what we've just heard. And it seems in this case it makes it harder for us to connect the sounds in that word to some other sensation as well."
21,155,Lauren,"And that's what happened as well in the Songe language, which was the other language from PNG with that other failure, is that they didn't have a 't' sound in the language, so they didn't have that /t/, so they couldn't even say -- they used 'takete' for this."
21,156,Suzy,"Takete and maluma, yeah."
21,157,Lauren,"So, like, 'takete' -- that 't' wasn't even a sound."
21,158,Suzy,And they also didn't have the /l/ sound.
21,159,Lauren,Yeah.
21,160,Suzy,"Maluma. So when we went back to the 1975 paper and we double-checked and we double-checked, and we found out that they had also used non-word-y words in their test."
21,161,Lauren,Yeah.
21,162,Suzy,"So suddenly there are these two failures in the literature, and both of them had non-word-y words. So what this suggested to us was when we go through that process of learning how our language sounds, the way that the brain adapts to the sound structure of the language kind of overflows outside of just listening for understanding into everything we do with those sounds."
21,163,Lauren,I have never been more excited to fail in my life. So great!
21,164,Suzy,"Yeah, actually! It was was very exciting."
21,165,Lauren,"So I hadn't realised that it was weird to work with non-WEIRD people, I hadn't realised -- well, I don't think either of us realised that you could break the kiki/bouba, maluma/takete thing."
21,166,Suzy,Mm.
21,167,Lauren,"And I hadn't realised that it was weird to suggest that we do this work on a language with tone, because you were doing some work on Mandarin. But that's some of the first work that's looked at this cross-sensory effect. And again it's just because, well, English speakers will start with English and not think about the fact that many languages have tone to mark the difference between words."
21,168,Suzy,Mmm. Are your listeners particularly familiar with tone languages and how they work?
21,169,Lauren,Let's do a very quick Tone 101.
21,170,Suzy,"Tone 101. So the idea is that different languages pay attention to different properties of the way noises sound. So some languages in the world, when you change the pitch of your voice, it can signal a fundamentally different word meaning. So to give an example from Chinese, if we say a syllable like /m/ - /a/ joined up together but with a different kind of pitch contour, it can mean something different. So I'll give you a little example."
21,171,Lauren,Okay.
21,172,Suzy,"If I say 'mā,' it's a very common word that you would use to refer to your mother."
21,173,Lauren,Okay.
21,174,Suzy,"If I say 'mǎ,' it means 'horse.' So in this example what we can see is that the consonant and the vowel are the same for for those utterances, but the way the voice changes in pitch signals a difference in word meaning. And this is a bit different from languages like English."
21,175,Lauren,Yep.
21,176,Suzy,So what we know from decades of people trying to teach Westerners how to speak Chinese is that people who don't speak languages with tone have difficulty catching on to the pitch property of the words that they're hearing and remembering it long enough to learn the meaning of it.
21,177,Lauren,"I can never remember -- you know, there's only two, there's high and low in Syuba, and I never remember or really remember which one it should be."
21,178,Suzy,Yeah! So there seems to be something fundamentally different about the way that brains of English speakers process pitch compared to the brains of Mandarin speakers who've grown up in a language that uses this property. So what we wanted to know in some of our other studies is whether or not the perceptual tuning to audio that has gone on for Mandarin speakers also changes the cross-modal connection between hearing and vision.
21,179,Lauren,Right.
21,180,Suzy,"So we've been running a bunch of studies with my former PhD student, Shang Nan, where what we've been doing is asking people who speak different combinations of languages to make some judgements of the bouba/kiki kind, but listening to, instead of whole long words like maluma and takete, they're just listening to very short, single-syllable names. So they might be hearing /ī/ or /ǐ/ or /í/ or /ì/."
21,181,Lauren,"And I'm not gonna lie, like, the first thing I think of when I hear all four of those is /i/. That's all I take away!"
21,182,Suzy,Right! So then we also ask them the same questions for the /u/ sounds. So we had /ū/ and /ǔ/ and /ú/ and /ù/.
21,183,Lauren,"And you'll be unsurprised to know that what I take away from that is /u/, like, with any intonation."
21,184,Suzy,"And we found this quite a lot, actually. Our English-speaking participants struggle to really hear the difference between the different sounds, but, you know, they could always make a choice depending on whether it was an /i/ sound or an /u/ sound."
21,185,Lauren,Yeah.
21,186,Suzy,"So we showed them a kiki-type shape and a bouba-type shape, and had our people make their choices. And overall, everybody preferred the /i/ noises to go with the spiky ones and the /u/ noises to go with the blobby ones."
21,187,Lauren,"Okay, so that still works."
21,188,Suzy,"But on top of that there was a tendency for the people who grew up in Mandarin Chinese to really, really like to match the high steady tone like /ū/ with the blobby shape."
21,189,Lauren,Okay.
21,190,Suzy,Whereas our English speakers liked to match the high tone /ī/ with the spiky one.
21,191,Lauren,Yep. That gels with my personal feelings.
21,192,Suzy,"So what we were finding, then, was that the English speakers were paying attention to the high frequency elements, the high pitch of the voice in /ī/ and saying, 'That's a spiky thing!' Just like the staple is a high frequency noise and just like the /k/ sound in 'kiki' is a high-frequency noise. That all goes together to make a package that says high frequency should be spiky. Our Mandarin speakers were paying attention to pitch in a completely different way. They were paying attention to how much the pitch changed. So when they hear sound like /ū/, it's nice and smooth and stable and steady -- or at least this is what my PhD student who is a native speaker of Mandarin Chinese tells me."
21,193,Lauren,Right! I trust her.
21,194,Suzy,"Whereas when they heard a sound like /ù/, they were finding that a very dramatic sound because it becomes loud and then quiet very, very quickly, and the pitch changes a lot. So that was a very spiky sound for our Mandarin speakers. So here what we see is this intriguing case where when we listen to just one feature of a sound, whether the pitch is high, or whether it's changing, or whether it's high, or whether it's low, two groups of speakers make exactly opposite decisions for which one should go with which, and it seems to be driven by the way that their brain processes these sounds differently."
21,195,Lauren,"Hmm! Awesome! We are currently writing up what happened with Syuba tone, which is very exciting, and I will blog about it. And you, of course, run a lab in Singapore. I'm sure you'll also share it on the BLIP Lab website."
21,196,Suzy,Yes!
21,197,Lauren,"Which stands for Brain, Language and Intersensory Processing?"
21,198,Suzy,"Yes, indeed, so the BLIP Lab in Singapore, we have a little Facebook page, and we have a website as well, and we also tweet about our findings."
21,199,Lauren,From time to time you have really great online experiments that people can do! We'll be sure to share those when they come up.
21,200,Suzy,Yes!
21,201,Lauren,"If there's one thing you could leave people thinking about linguistics, what would it be?"
21,202,Suzy,"So when we learn and think about the way that language works, there's so much interesting and fabulous stuff going on that we often have this tendency to think about language in isolation."
21,203,Lauren,Mm-hmm.
21,204,Suzy,"And to think about the way that it works internally and how separate it is from everything else that we do or feel or experience. And the one thing I want to leave people with is how deeply embedded our language processing system is in our bodies, and how it's connected to the way that we process the information that's coming in through our senses.

22,1,Gretchen,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics! I'm Gretchen McCulloch."
22,2,Lauren,"And I'm Lauren Gawne, and today we're talking about this, that, and the other thing! The other thing of course being determiners. But first: We met our recent Patreon goal to do a live show!"
22,3,Gretchen,"Yay, live show! I'm excited! We will have more news for you about where and when that live show is gonna be, but stay tuned!"
22,4,Lauren,"Thanks to everyone who helped us meet this goal, all of our fabulous patrons who make these main episodes happen ad-free and available for everyone, and who, of course, as a thank you from us, get a bonus episode every month as well!"
22,5,Gretchen,"And if you're a patron, you'll also have seen the advance announcement that since we also met our art goal a while back --"
22,6,Lauren,"Yay, art goal!"
22,7,Gretchen,"-- we now have preview art up on Patreon which you can see, a sample sketch, and we're announcing here that the theme for this art is space babies!"
22,8,Lauren,"Space babies! We are so excited. Space babies have been with us since Episode 1, where we talked about what would happen on the International Space Station, given that they speak both Russian and English as their daily languages, if we sent a whole bunch of babies to space to grow up."
22,9,Gretchen,"Yes, if all the astronauts and cosmonauts started having babies together, what would the babies speak? So we have an international array of cute babies floating in space, very unethically, we are not sending any actual babies to space, but they're very cute when they're cartoon versions!"
22,10,Lauren,We just couldn't get the ethics.
22,11,Gretchen,"To be honest, we didn't try to get the ethics, we knew we couldn't."
22,12,Lauren,"We've talked about space babies in a couple of other episodes, and of course we always love to chat about just what great language learners babies are, so we're very happy to have some cute little mascots for the show. And we'll be launching merch for those very soon!"
22,13,Gretchen,"And this has been one of our most popular quotes with you, the listeners, all the way through, so you will get to wear, or have stickers of, small, cute babies very soon! And you can see this preview and listen to two new bonus episodes -- one about forensic linguistics, and another about homonyms -- by becoming a patron. [Music]"
22,14,Lauren,"Okay, Gretchen, it's time to determine who knows the most determiners. Are you ready? This is not a competition, but, you know, I love framing things as a competition."
22,15,Gretchen,It's a competition! It's on! Okay. I'm gonna start with 'the.'
22,16,Lauren,"Oh, damn, you chose the easy one! I'm gonna go with 'a.'"
22,17,Gretchen,My.
22,18,Lauren,This.
22,19,Gretchen,Your?
22,20,Lauren,That?
22,21,Gretchen,Her.
22,22,Lauren,Its.
22,23,Gretchen,His.
22,24,Lauren,Many?
22,25,Gretchen,"Their... I did all the possessives, I'm sorry, it's really easy."
22,26,Lauren,"That's very possessive of you, Gretchen."
22,27,Gretchen,Our!
22,28,Lauren,Some?
22,29,Gretchen,A.
22,30,Lauren,Three.
22,31,Gretchen,"And also 'an,' because 'an' is just kind of the same one."
22,32,Lauren,"Okay, you get half a point for 'an' because I had 'a.'"
22,33,Gretchen,"Uh, those."
22,34,Lauren,Four.
22,35,Gretchen,These.
22,36,Lauren,Five.
22,37,Gretchen,Some.
22,38,Lauren,Six.
22,39,Gretchen,"Okay, if you're gonna do numbers we can be here... all day."
22,40,Lauren,Seven.
22,41,Gretchen,"Like, until eternity."
22,42,Lauren,"Eight, nine... okay, we have literally an infinite number of determiners ahead of us. It's probably not gonna make for a good episode if it's just me counting to infinity."
22,43,Gretchen,"I think we need to declare it a tie, because we can't count who knows the most infinity numbers."
22,44,Lauren,"Yup. And it's a good conclusion. Thanks for playing our game, Determiners Determinered."
22,45,Gretchen,"Determiner Determiner Game. But determiners are really cool! And there are a lot of them, and I know when I learned about them, it kind of blew my mind that all of these different things that I thought of as different kinds of parts of speech actually had this hidden thing in common."
22,46,Lauren,"Yeah, so even though that sounded like a grab bag of words that you think of as coming from different categories -- like numbers, and possessive pronouns, and articles, and things that you've talked about as different parts of speech -- if you've ever done any grammar, are actually part of the same group of things called determiners. And it's like discovering that all of these people that you thought were really cool all have something in common that makes them even cooler?"
22,47,Gretchen,"Like they all have a mutual friend with you, or -- in my case, it's like discovering that all your friends are all also left-handed, because this happens to me periodically. It's like, 'You're left-handed, too! Great!'"
22,48,Lauren,"Or it's like when I discover that a bunch of my friends are vegetarian and I'm like, 'Yes! Dinner parties at my house!'"
22,49,Gretchen,I will still come to your dinner parties even though I'm not vegetarian.
22,50,Lauren,"Okay, thank you, tolerant carnivore."
22,51,Gretchen,Omnivore!
22,52,Lauren,"But that's like, you know, there are some omnivores who will turn up to the party, and they might be doing different things at other parties sometimes, but they're very happy to be vegetarians at my parties. And that is kind of like determiners, these parts of speech that might have other jobs, but they have this job as well."
22,53,Gretchen,"Yeah, and what I really like about determiner is that they're these tiny little words, and they can really drastically change the course of a story you're talking about, just by influencing the perspective or the relationship that you have with the main noun in the sentence. So if you start with a story like, 'I was walking home last night and I saw a cat.' So far..."
22,54,Lauren,Great story.
22,55,Gretchen,"Oh, it's a good story, any story with a cat is a good story. But so far it's a pretty straightforward story. Nothing surprising here."
22,56,Lauren,But it's clearly a cat you don't know.
22,57,Gretchen,Yeah.
22,58,Lauren,"Or we think you don't know, at this point in the story."
22,59,Gretchen,"But if I say, 'I was walking home last night and I saw the cat...'"
22,60,Lauren,"Oh my god, your cat got out and then you saw it!"
22,61,Gretchen,"So maybe that's my cat, but maybe that's just, like, The Cat of Doom."
22,62,Lauren,Mmm!
22,63,Gretchen,"Or, like, 'I was walking last night and I saw that cat.'"
22,64,Lauren,"Aw, has it been scratching up all of your plants again?"
22,65,Gretchen,"That darn cat! Or if I say, 'I was walking home last night and I saw your cat...'"
22,66,Lauren,"Oh! I mean, that's surprising given that you live in a different city and I don't have a cat, but, you know..."
22,67,Gretchen,"We live in different continents, like, your cat is a good swimmer! ""I was walking home last night and I saw many cats...'"
22,68,Lauren,"Oh, lucky you!"
22,69,Gretchen,"Well, depends on how many. ""I was walking home last night and I saw a million cats!'"
22,70,Lauren,'I was walking home last night and I saw at least ten cats.'
22,71,Gretchen,"Like, I'm scared now. You know that thing about 'would you rather fight a horse-sized duck or a thousand duck-sized horses?'?"
22,72,Lauren,Yes.
22,73,Gretchen,"Like, a million cats, I don't want to fight them!"
22,74,Lauren,No.
22,75,Gretchen,"And I don't even think I want them all to sit in my lap, because I think I'd be crushed."
22,76,Lauren,"Yes, that is a lot of fluff."
22,77,Gretchen,"Yeah. So what's interesting about determiners is they can -- you know, all of these were the same story, except for the determiner. And it's really having a huge influence in terms of what happened and the relationship between the noun 'cat' and the rest of the sentence, the rest of the story. It determines which cat I'm talking about, or -- 'which' being another determiner -- or what kind of relationship that cat has to the sentence as a whole."
22,78,Lauren,"I always think of determiners as a really important reality check in terms of semantics. We often think about whether it was a cat or a dog, like that part of the meaning is really important. It's like, well, that part is, but the determiner is the part that makes it clear just how real it is, if it's a hypothetical cat, if it's a real dog, if it's my cat or my dog."
22,79,Gretchen,"And especially it tells us things like whether it's been previously mentioned in conversation. Like if I say, 'I saw a cat' or 'I saw the cat' -- if I say, 'I saw the cat,' that implies that it's been mentioned somehow before, it's an aforementioned cat, or it's a cat that's been previously relevant. Or if I say, 'I saw this cat' versus 'I saw that cat,' those cats are different distances from me. Or, you know, 'Do you want this book or that book?' The 'this book' is closer and the 'that book' is further away."
22,80,Lauren,"I like to think about this proximity distinction a lot, because English has squandered the opportunity to have yet another proximity distinction. Because we used to have 'yon' or 'yonder' as part of the regular vocabulary, which was, like, further away than 'that.' And so I could say, 'Tell me about yon cat,' and that would be like, 'Tell me about the cat that's all the way over there' in the story that you're telling."
22,81,Gretchen,That would be great. I think we should bring back 'yon.'
22,82,Lauren,We should bring back the far distal demonstrative.
22,83,Gretchen,I'm into it. I was walking home last night and I saw yon cat!
22,84,Lauren,"Well, I mean, it was the size of a horse, so it was pretty easy to see."
22,85,Gretchen,That's why I could see it from so far away.
22,86,Lauren,"Yep. And there are some languages that still have these distinctions, I think Portuguese is a language that has it."
22,87,Gretchen,"Yeah, I know Spanish does. You can have, like, 'ese gato' and 'aquel gato,' I think."
22,88,Lauren,"Yep. And you can have a distinction between 'essa,' which is like me/you in Portuguese, but you can have 'aquela,' which is like over there, away from both of us. Which, in terms of like asking people to fetch cake for you, which is a context I think about a lot, distinguishing between the cake that's near you and the cake that is further away on the table and not near either of us, like, English doesn't do that very elegantly."
22,89,Gretchen,"I think it's really important, you know, if you're going to a bakery or something and you're looking behind the glass and you're saying, 'Yeah, I want three of these, and three of those, and three of yon.'"
22,90,Lauren,Yeah.
22,91,Gretchen,The cakes over yonder!
22,92,Lauren,"So English, even though it has a lot of distinctions, we're still missing out on some good semantics."
22,93,Gretchen,"Yeah! And some languages don't have this distinction between 'a' and 'the' at all, really! Like, some languages do just fine without it, and it's clear based on the discourse which one is there. One of the other cool things that I really like about determiners is that they can let us do -- like a lot of these little little, tiny parts of speech, these little words that are kind of the glue between the big, important content words that have all this very vivid, drawable or picture-able or pointable meaning -- you know, you can draw a picture of a cat, you can't draw a picture of a 'the' or of a 'this.' I mean, maybe you want to try! I'd like to see someone try, but I don't know what's in that picture! And so when you're thinking about the type of things that can be pictured, one of the things that lets us bring in and integrate new words, or nonsense words, or fake words, or be really creative with language, is these little building blocks that tell us, when we're bringing in a new fake word, what we're actually trying to do with that word. So it's not just an entire string of gibberish, it's gibberish that sounds like it could be kind of English-y, which is a really interesting halfway point."
22,94,Lauren,And it does this by leveraging things like determiners.
22,95,Gretchen,"Yeah! And determiners are a huge part of this. So if you have a poem like Jabberwocky, which is a great poem..."
22,96,Lauren,"Good old Jabberwocky! I give this to my students and I say, 'Well, how do you know what part of speech 'wabe' is?' Because 'wabe' is not a real word."
22,97,Gretchen,"So this is a poem by Lewis Carroll which begins, ''Twas brillig, and the slithy toves/ Did gyre and gimble in the wabe.' So it's English-y! It's got some English in there, there's an 'and,' and there's a 'the,' and there's a 'did,' and there's an 'in,' but there's also all these words that aren't English: brillig, and slithy, and toves, and gyre, and gimble, and wabe. And yet we know that if you say, ''Twas brillig,' that the 'brillig' there is gonna be an adjective, and the 'slithy toves' -- 'slithy' is also gonna be an adjective, but 'tove' has got to be a noun."
22,98,Lauren,Yep.
22,99,Gretchen,And the reason we know that is because of the 'the' there.
22,100,Lauren,"And similar with 'the wabe.' There's only one wabe in the Jabberwocky, there's not a million wabes."
22,101,Gretchen,Yeah! And you know that because of the 'the.'
22,102,Lauren,Yep.
22,103,Gretchen,"And it creates -- if you said, ''Twas brillig and some some slithy toves did gyre and gimble in a wabe...'"
22,104,Lauren,"You'd be like, 'Oh, just one of those common wabes, yeah, we've all got one.'"
22,105,Gretchen,"Exactly! So it really kind of creates a different attitude of perspectives and speakers, like, okay, this thing is common knowledge. We don't know what a wabe is, but we know it's a thing that is previously mentioned in the discourse, or that there's only one of, the way you might say 'the sea' or 'the ocean' rather than 'a puddle.'"
22,106,Lauren,"Of course Jabberwocky's all well and good, but I like to use snek memes as my diagnostic tool."
22,107,Gretchen,So this is the meme with the snakes in it.
22,108,Lauren,"And snakes, of course, like all animals in picture memes on the internet, talk really funny!"
22,109,Gretchen,Yes. And they're particularly good at making things nouns that aren't supposed to be nouns?
22,110,Lauren,Yeah.
22,111,Gretchen,"Or that weren't originally nouns. So the classic snek sentence that I always think of when I think of the snek meme is, 'Heck off, you're doing me a frighten!'"
22,112,Lauren,And there are a few others that we have from Snekville here: 'I do a flat.' 'I am much venom.' 'Snek ned a boopings.' 'I'm doing a protec.'
22,113,Gretchen,"And so all of these -- you have 'a frighten.' 'Frighten' normally in English is a verb, but here the 'a' is what's making it into a noun. And you parse it as a noun, that's what makes it work, but the determiner is really what's telling you. It's kind of the traffic signal for the streets that your noun and verb cars run down, that tell them where to go."
22,114,Lauren,Yep.
22,115,Gretchen,"And the same thing with 'much venom,' the 'much' there, another determiner, is telling you, okay, 'venom' here, which would be a noun, is now actually I guess kind of..."
22,116,Lauren,"It's a different kind of noun, yeah. It's changing the flavor of the noun."
22,117,Gretchen,"Yeah. Or 'snek need a boopings,' you know, you don't normally put 'a' with a plural noun. 'Boopings.'"
22,118,Lauren,Because 'a' is one specific thing.
22,119,Gretchen,"Yeah, there's a lot of things there that -- like, the thing that makes snek an interesting and creative meme is that it has the determiners telling you here's why these nouns and these adjectives and stuff sound weird."
22,120,Lauren,"I like that you pointed out, when we were assembling our mini snek corpus for the episode, that snek is really obsessed with the use of 'a' rather than 'the.'"
22,121,Gretchen,"Mm, yeah. So snek doesn't say, 'You're doing me the frighten,' or 'I do the flat,' like I do the twist, or 'snek need the boopings,' 'I'm doing the protec.' Those don't sound very snek-like to me!"
22,122,Lauren,"No, there's something about the indeterminate. Everything is possible for snek, everything is multitudes."
22,123,Gretchen,"Yeah, whereas when I think of earlier memes, especially the kind of lolcat memes that often respelled 'the' as 'teh' --"
22,124,Lauren,"Yeah. Well, I think it's just 'cause the ""the' as 'teh' was so much more salient, because it was graphically irregular, that it kind of seems much more prominently 'cat.'"
22,125,Gretchen,"Yeah, I think of 'teh' as cats and 'a' as snek. So each each animal meme gets its own characteristic determiner. Well, and we can even think of, like, the doge meme, which has like, 'wow such meme!'"
22,126,Lauren,"Doge was very obsessed with 'such' and 'much' and these, like, quantifying..."
22,127,Gretchen,And 'many.'
22,128,Lauren,Yeah.
22,129,Gretchen,"Yeah, all these quantifier determiners. So, yeah! They tend to draw on a characteristic set of determiners, which I think is kind of interesting."
22,130,Lauren,Yeah. 'Do me such frighten' would be more doge-y.
22,131,Gretchen,"Yeah, and like, 'Do me teh frighten' might be more lolcat-y."
22,132,Lauren,"Yeah. Gosh, imagine if Lewis Carroll was alive in the time of animal memes!"
22,133,Gretchen,"I feel like Jabberwocky is already almost a meme. If you put that on some images, it would kind of look meme-like. And I think you can even see -- so we did an episode a little while back about the wug test. So the wug test is, you show people a picture of this cute, little, nonsense animal, and you say, 'This is a wug. Now there are two of them. There are two...' And you leave open that space for them to fill in 'two wugs,' which is how you know people can generalise the plural to words they've never heard before, even little kids."
22,134,Lauren,Yep.
22,135,Gretchen,"But the thing that makes that test possible is that we have certain expectations and certain relationships with determiners. 'This is a wug.' So here's a new piece of information to you, you haven't necessarily seen one of these before. And then saying, 'Now there are two of them. There are two...' You know, numbers are also determiners, so 'there are two...' fills in, okay, you want to say this again, you want to say this noun again."
22,136,Lauren,"I wonder if you could mess up kids doing the test by saying, 'This is the wug.'"
22,137,Gretchen,Hmm!
22,138,Lauren,"Because if you say, 'This is the wug', and imply that there's, like, one, saying there are two could potentially confuse them."
22,139,Gretchen,"Yeah, that's interesting! Because there are some things that... Can you do this? Because I'm thinking of, like, there are some proper names that you can say, like, 'The Flash,' for a superhero, but I don't think you can say, like, 'Now there are two of them, there are two... The Flashes?"
22,140,Lauren,The Flashes.
22,141,Gretchen,"Like, what if The Flash was in some sort of, like, clone/evil twin weird movie where there was a second The Flash, are they now called The Flashes? How does that work?"
22,142,Lauren,The Flashes. It sounds like a really bad band or a spate of petty criminals.
22,143,Gretchen,"This is my band, The Flashes."
22,144,Lauren,"Yeah, so the wug test also relies on determiners in a really low-key way, but it's still really important for it."
22,145,Gretchen,And this kind of brings us into determiners and how they interact with names of people or names of places and other types of proper nouns that are unique and singular.
22,146,Lauren,"Yeah. So we've said so far that determiners, you just whack 'em on a noun and it's all good, but there are a bunch of nouns that they don't work too good with! And proper nouns are definitely those, so people names and place names."
22,147,Gretchen,"Yeah, like I am not ""the Gretchen,' I don't think anyone can say that. Welcome to Lingthusiasm, I'm the Gretchen McCulloch!"
22,148,Lauren,But you are the Gretchen of Lingthusiasm. Someone could ask if you're the Gretchen from All Things Linguistic.
22,149,Gretchen,"That's true, yeah! Like, 'Are you the Gretchen that's on Lingthusiasm or are you some other Gretchen?' I think maybe it's easier with your name, Lauren, because 'Lauren' is a far more common name."
22,150,Lauren,"Well, yeah, I am definitely a Lauren. Like I talk about being a linguist Lauren on Twitter, and how much I love all the other linguist Laurens."
22,151,Gretchen,I know many linguist Laurens.
22,152,Lauren,"And saying, you know, in the 2000s that someone was a real Britney..."
22,153,Gretchen,Mmm!
22,154,Lauren,It takes on a kind of adjectival title property of that name being very trendy at that time and having certain connotations and extra meanings.
22,155,Gretchen,"Yeah, like, a Britney is definitely different from a Karen."
22,156,Lauren,Yes.
22,157,Gretchen,"You have different associations between those. So, I read this really weird short story called 'And Then There Were (N-One)' by Sarah Pinkser."
22,158,Lauren,Hang on. 'And Then There Were N Minus One'?
22,159,Gretchen,"Yeah, it's a pun on the Agatha Christie story, 'And Then There Were None.'"
22,160,Lauren,Okay.
22,161,Gretchen,"And the premise of the story -- I guess this is a spoiler. It's a great story, though, you should read it. I won't spoil the ending."
22,162,Lauren,Okay.
22,163,Gretchen,"I'll just spoil the premise partway through. So the author is Sarah Pinsker, and she kind of involves herself as a character in this story. She gets a mysterious letter that says, 'We have discovered the theory of multiple universes such that every decision that anybody has ever made has created a proliferation of universes. And we're inviting you to a convention with all of the other Sarah Pinskers.'"
22,164,Lauren,"Ah, so she's just a Sarah Pinsker."
22,165,Gretchen,"Right! And so you're gonna meet the Sarah Pinsker that didn't move to Seattle, or you're gonna meet the Sarah Pinsker that didn't end up dating your girlfriend. Like, you're gonna meet all of these different, other Sarah Pinskers."
22,166,Lauren,Yeah.
22,167,Gretchen,"And some of the Sarah Pinskers have changed their last name, but they're still a Sarah. And so the story has a lot of her trying to identify the different Sarahs once she meets them. So she's like, ""Okay, so this is the Sarah that was wearing the band t-shirt,' or, 'This is the Sarah that was wearing the cute dress,' or, ""This is the Sarah that had her hair in a long braid.'"
22,168,Lauren,Yep.
22,169,Gretchen,"Or she'll go into a room and she'll be like, 'Well, there were seven Sarahs in the room.' Or like, 'One Sarah said, and then another Sarah said...' And so you're doing all of these determiner things to this proper name, because suddenly 'Sarah' has become a type rather than just a unique referent."
22,170,Lauren,'Sarah' just sounds like any other noun right now.
22,171,Gretchen,"Yeah! Right? Like, you're totally semantically satiated on 'Sarah' because it just doesn't even feel like it's a person's name anymore. And by the time I got to the end of this short story, which was very interesting in terms of what it means -- you know, interesting questions of identity -- it was like, what do all of these Sarahs mean and what does this mean about your ability to make these types of decisions? But grammatically I also thought it was very interesting because you don't often get to have proper names being pluralised and 'the Sarah' and 'a Sarah' and 'one Sarah,' 'another Sarah,' and these kinds of things."
22,172,Lauren,Certainly not sustainedly.
22,173,Gretchen,"Yeah! So you have this whole short story where it does that. We'll link to it, it's a great short story."
22,174,Lauren,"I find it interesting -- we were talking about this briefly the other day when we were talking about this topic -- how superhero names do this, and I couldn't find anything, because this is definitely not my genre of popular entertainment, but if you have any links about the use of 'the' or not in front of superhero names. It's kind of interesting, because we have, you know, The Flash and The Phantom, but it would be really weird to have The Superman."
22,175,Gretchen,The Batman!
22,176,Lauren,The Wonder Woman.
22,177,Gretchen,"Well, I was actually also thinking of this in terms of other mythical creatures! 'Cause you have, like, Santa Claus, not the Santa Claus. But then you have --"
22,178,Lauren,But you have the Easter Bunny!
22,179,Gretchen,The Easter Bunny! And the Tooth Fairy!
22,180,Lauren,"Hmm! Santa, special status."
22,181,Gretchen,"Right? And all the reindeer, too. Like, you have Rudolph, not the Rudolph."
22,182,Lauren,The Mrs. Claus.
22,183,Gretchen,"The Mrs. Claus! I guess you have 'the elves,' because they don't have unique identities, but that's a little bit less distinctive."
22,184,Lauren,Yeah. Poor elves.
22,185,Gretchen,"Well, and the same thing goes for other types of generic items. So you have, like, the internet, but something people kind of make fun of sometimes is often older people who talk about, like, 'the Google' or 'the Facebook.'"
22,186,Lauren,"Well, the Facebook was The Facebook and they made --"
22,187,Gretchen,"Yeah, it was originally called The Facebook!"
22,188,Lauren,"The mysterious forces of branding and naming were like, 'It's not cool, just make it Facebook.'"
22,189,Gretchen,"I was trying to think of any other major companies that had 'the' in them. I'm sure I'll think of one as soon as I stop trying to go for it. Like, you don't have like 'The Amazon,' or 'The Microsoft,' or 'The Coca-Cola.' You know, like... The Coca- Cola?? The Pepsi??"
22,190,Lauren,It doesn't really work.
22,191,Gretchen,The McDonald's? I don't know if there are any that really do that.
22,192,Lauren,"English isn't that big on putting determiners in front of proper nouns, unless it's in sci-fi."
22,193,Gretchen,"And you do have, sometimes, 'the' in front of other words that are just kind of generic, like you say, 'The power went out.'"
22,194,Lauren,Yep.
22,195,Gretchen,"It's the power, it's not a power. Like, the electricity is out. It's a specific thing, but it's also kind of not."
22,196,Lauren,"Yeah. And this is what makes languages always fun to learn, because what you do by default in one language and use determiners all over the place in one context, you might not in another language."
22,197,Gretchen,"Yeah, absolutely. Like in countries. Most countries in English you don't say, you know, 'the Canada' or 'the Australia.'"
22,198,Lauren,Welcome to the Australia! It does not sound natural or native to my English speaker intuition.
22,199,Gretchen,"No. But a few of them -- like, you say 'the United States' or 'the United Kingdom,' partly because those are compound phrases."
22,200,Lauren,Yep.
22,201,Gretchen,You don't say 'the Great Britain.'
22,202,Lauren,No.
22,203,Gretchen,"Or 'the England.' And then you also have some like Ukraine, which used to be known as the Ukraine, and now they're like, 'No, please call us just Ukraine, because we want to be like all the other countries.' But there are still a few countries like the Vatican or the Hague that go by 'the""s."
22,204,Lauren,"Uhh, The Hague is a city."
22,205,Gretchen,"Is it a city? Okay. Well, so there we go."
22,206,Lauren,"So there are a few places like the Vatican and the Hague that are still using determiners in English, but it's definitely not a standard convention."
22,207,Gretchen,"Yeah, exactly. But in French, for example, you do put determiners in front of all your countries. So you have ""le Canada,' and 'la France,' and 'l'Australie,' and these kinds of things. So these are these, like, weird, little subtle variations that even when a language seems like they have direct equivalents, they get used slightly differently in different contexts. My favourite ridiculously complicated word having to do with determiners..."
22,208,Lauren,Yep. I've already used the word 'proximal' in this episode so you're gonna beat me.
22,209,Gretchen,"This is a word that you only ever use because you can have it, and I've only ever seen linguists use it to be like, 'What a great word!' And I've never actually seen it in a context where someone wasn't sign-posting how great a word it was? So definitely don't think you have to know this word to be a linguist, but also a lot of linguistics really like this word. And this word is 'anarthrous.' I think I'm pronouncing it right."
22,210,Lauren,Anarthrous?
22,211,Gretchen,Anarthrous. And this means 'not having a 'the.''
22,212,Lauren,Mmm! That's a really obscure word for saying 'this word doesn't have a 'the.''
22,213,Gretchen,"It's such a complicated word for such a simple concept. And so 'arthrous,' without the 'an-', would be 'having a 'the,'' and 'anarthrous' would be 'not having a 'the.''"
22,214,Lauren,Anarthrous also just sounds like a really great roller derby name for a linguist nerd.
22,215,Gretchen,"Hi, my name is Ann! Ann Arthrous."
22,216,Lauren,"Yep, done."
22,217,Gretchen,"So a context where you might use this, and a context where I recently saw this word, was in Lynne Murphy's book, which we talked about in a recent episode, where she talks about how Americans will say, 'I'm in the hospital,' and Brits will say, 'I'm in hospital.' And so for Brits, 'hospital' is anarthrous. And for Americans, 'hospital' is arthrous, as in, you put a 'the' there. And you can do it with similar things, like, you go to school, you don't go to the school."
22,218,Lauren,Yep.
22,219,Gretchen,"But you go to, like, the grocery store, which is the generic grocery store, even if you mean a specific one."
22,220,Lauren,That's a good word. Try to use it in a sentence today.
22,221,Gretchen,"Use it today! No one will understand you. And then you too will get to explain what it means! This is the thing that's always stopped me from getting any active use of the word, 'cause I know no one else would get it either."
22,222,Lauren,"We'll post a link to that in the show notes, so you also know how to spell it."
22,223,Gretchen,"Lynne's got this great point in her book where she talks about the 'in hospital' thing, and then she's like, 'It's anarthrous!' And then she puts in brackets, 'A word which I only use because it's so great, and here's what it means.' And I'm like, yeah, I see what you did there."
22,224,Lauren,Pretty much.
22,225,Gretchen,I would have done the same thing.
22,226,Lauren,"So we mentioned briefly that even English can't agree on when you use articles and determiners and when you don't use them, and that varies even more cross-linguistically. We saw it with English and French, but I also like that different languages have different resources to draw on. And we talked about how determiners are this diverse group of words that can kind of be invited to the same party and hang out together and do a similar thing. And I think it's really interesting, if you've learnt a couple of languages, you might notice that some of the languages you speak have a distinct word that meets the function of 'a' or 'an,' but some languages just co-opt their word for 'one' in doing that."
22,227,Gretchen,"Oh yeah, that's true!"
22,228,Lauren,"Yeah. So, Syuba is a language like that, the Tibeto-Burman language of Nepal that I work with. So if you want to refer to an indeterminate, just any particular one of a thing, you would say 'gùri tɕí,' 'one cat,' and that does the same job as 'a' without having to invent a whole other word."
22,229,Gretchen,"I think there are a bunch of European languages that do that too, because I know French and Spanish do, and German does, you have 'un chat,' or 'un gato,' or 'eine Katze.' And those are all the same as the word for 'one' in those languages."
22,230,Lauren,And there's a there's a really great WALS map -- we've talked about the World Atlas of Linguistic Structures before -- that shows where there are languages that have a distinct type determiner and languages that use the numeral one for that function.
22,231,Gretchen,"Oh, that's very cool. So we can click on this link and see a map of different coloured dots where the word for 'a' is the same as the word for 'one' and where it's different."
22,232,Lauren,Yep!
22,233,Gretchen,That's really neat!
22,234,Lauren,"And the definite equivalent, so the 'the' equivalent, is 'dì,' and that's the same as the word for 'this.'"
22,235,Gretchen,"Oh, okay!"
22,236,Lauren,"So they don't have a separate 'the' and 'this,' they just have this one form, 'dì.' They have a distal, and they have a 'somewhere between far and near' as well, super cool. And what's really cool is that for the 'the' equivalent, you say 'dì gùri,' or 'the cat,' and in this case the determiner is before the noun, and with the number, it was after, it was 'gùri tɕí' so that's 'cat one' as a kind of literal translation. And it's really, again, a nice reminder that determiners can have such different functions and they can occur in different parts of the sentence in relation to the noun, but they still all have this same function."
22,237,Gretchen,"And there's a map of that, too, of which languages have their word for 'this' and their word for 'the' as the same."
22,238,Lauren,"Yep. Thanks, WALS!"
22,239,Gretchen,"What I find is kind of the most interesting thing about determiners as a category is the way that they kind of unify a bunch of things that we think of as similar. Latin actually has this thing that's very similar to what's in Syuba, which is their word for 'this,' which was 'ille, illa, illud' in Latin, became the Romance 'le, la, les' or 'el, los, las.'"
22,240,Lauren,"Ahh! I was gonna say, they sound familiar."
22,241,Gretchen,Yeah! And so the Latin word for 'this' became the word for 'the' in the Romance languages.
22,242,Lauren,Mmm!
22,243,Gretchen,"So this is a thing that happens from language to language, even when they have no contact with each other, and they've never heard of each other, and they're nowhere near each other geographically. This is just a trend that languages seem to have. And the same thing for -- have you ever wondered why we have two forms, 'a' and 'an'?"
22,244,Lauren,"Yes? But it's because -- I mean, I know the environments that they occur in, that 'an' occurs before something vowel-y or something H-y, but that's a complicated historical complication."
22,245,Gretchen,"Yeah. But 'an' is actually older than 'a,' right?"
22,246,Lauren,Ahh! Yeah.
22,247,Gretchen,And the 'an' that's an 'an' is because it has the same root as the word 'one' in English.
22,248,Lauren,"Mmmm! I have the Etymonline links, as I always love to do, for 'a' and 'the' that I'll put in the show notes."
22,249,Gretchen,"So if you go to Etymonline and you look up the word 'one,' you can see that it's the same root as 'only,' or 'alone,' or 'atone,' which is like, 'at one,' 'all one.'"
22,250,Lauren,Mmm!
22,251,Gretchen,"And in the dialect form 'good'un' or 'young'un,' that 'un' is a 'one' as well. But the 'one' pronunciation came up later, and 'an' was also a version of that."
22,252,Lauren,Yep.
22,253,Gretchen,"And so if you have 'own' and 'an,' you can hear how those are very similar to each other, and they're from the same root. So English actually has that connection. But the thing that makes me the most excited about thinking about determiners as a group is that it helps explain a few things about how we use determiners. So if you have a word like 'the,' you don't just go around saying 'the' by itself in a sentence. Like, you can't say, 'I saw a cat, and then the kept going on,' or something like that. Because that does not work."
22,254,Lauren,"You missed a word, Gretchen!"
22,255,Gretchen,"It needs a noun there, for support. But other determiners like 'this' and 'that,' they can act by themselves without support. So you can say, 'I saw this cat, and then this kept going on.' Maybe that's not particularly good sentence, but you can say, like, 'Give me this book and then I'll move this here,' or something like that."
22,256,Lauren,Yep.
22,257,Gretchen,"And so you can, you know, like the title of this episode, 'this, that, and the other thing,' the 'this' and the 'that' in that sentence can each refer to specific things without there being a noun there for support. And what's interesting is that the pronoun 'they' in English comes into English from Old Norse, and it has the same origins as 'this' and 'that' and 'the.' They're all related to each other in terms of, like, 'that one' or 'those ones' or 'these ones.' All of those 'the' forms are related to each other. So some theories of determiners group all pronouns together with determiners, because a determiner by itself -- at least the ones that can appear by themselves, like 'this' and 'that' and 'many' -- act a lot like pronouns as well. And other languages also seem to have this set of relationships between what some of the pronouns can be and what some of what we think of as articles or something can be. And so if we group them into this category of determiners, it actually explains why these seem to have these weird similarities with each other."
22,258,Lauren,It explains why everyone's at the same party!
22,259,Gretchen,"Yeah! It's like seeing into the underpinnings, or the behind-the-scenes view of language and saying, actually, these things, if we think about them from a certain perspective, they do have a lot of weird similarities."
22,260,Lauren,"So like with Syuba, we have 'dì' being both 'the,' which has to be part of a noun phrase for it to make sense as a 'the' equivalent, but it also has its own full life as 'this' and can occur independently. And so the thing I like about thinking about all of these things as determiners, rather than thinking about pronouns and articles and all of this, is that it makes a lot of sense as something that would otherwise be really confusing and you'd be trying to give it a kind of double identity that's unnecessary."
22,261,Gretchen,"Yeah, and it's weird to me that 'determiner' as a name for this particular category is actually around 100 years old. It's pretty well-established. And it's weird for me that all through school, I never learned about determiners, I just learned about articles, and demonstratives, and pronouns, and possessive nouns, or possessive adjectives, or whatever they called all of these individual things. And I didn't learn that there was a name for the super category? And you can talk about articles separately if you want to, but it wasn't until I started doing linguistics that I learned there was actually a name for this whole category, even though this is something that's not controversial among linguists, and it's something that's generally accepted and, you know, you walk into Ling 101 and they might start talking about determiners. And it's weird to me that this hasn't necessarily trickled all the way down to high school grammar education, or elementary grammar education."
22,262,Lauren,It does make me sad you have to wait until you're in a linguistics undergrad class to know that there's even a party going on and the determiners are all there!
22,263,Gretchen,"Yeah! And, like, I'd studied a bunch of language and I'd learned what I thought were my parts of speech, and then I walk in and I'm like, 'What is this determiner thing? And how is it everywhere? And why is it so cool?' So I think people should know about determiners! I also have some determiner haikus to leave us with."
22,264,Lauren,Excellent.
22,265,Gretchen,Do you want to hear my determiner haikus?
22,266,Lauren,"Sure, go for it, now that we know all about them."
22,267,Gretchen,"Okay. So this is a multi-authored set of determiner haikus from Tumblr a couple years ago, and the first one is: The best thing aboutthe definite articleis that it is theA good thing aboutindefinite articlesis that they are a The best thing about using the demonstratives is when you go, 'This!'"
22,268,Lauren,That was beautiful.
22,269,Gretchen,All that my best thing re: some those determinersis all the above
22,270,Lauren,Thank you for those. I'll link to them on the show notes if you want to reread them and process them.
22,271,Gretchen,"You should definitely do that in case people want to write their own grammar haiku. If you write a grammar haiku, tag us in it, and we will retweet it. [Music]"

23,1,Lauren,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that is enthusiastic about linguistics! I'm Lauren Gawne."
23,2,Gretchen,"And I'm Gretchen McCulloch, and today we're talking about how nothingness fits into language. But first: We're very excited to announce the location for our live show, thanks to meeting our latest goal on Patreon, which we announced first in the bonus episode and now you get to find out here!"
23,3,Lauren,"So our last live show was in Gretchen's hometown of Montreal and we decided it's only fair that our next official show means that I get to repay the favour, and so we're going to have it in my hometown of Melbourne."
23,4,Gretchen,I'm so excited to get to go to Australia. I have never been to Australia before.
23,5,Lauren,I'm so excited to show you around Melbourne when you come to visit.
23,6,Gretchen,"I wanna see a kangaroo -- maybe not in Melbourne, I hear they're not super urban."
23,7,Lauren,That's okay. We have zoos. You'll get to see kangaroos.
23,8,Gretchen,"Okay, okay. This is important, I'm also very excited to be going to the Centre of Excellence for the Dynamics of Language Summer School in Canberra and the annual Australian Linguistic Society Conference in Adelaide, where I'm going to be talking about linguistics communication, doing workshops there, and if anyone else in Australia is listening to this and wants to invite me to do an event, now's your chance!"
23,9,Lauren,"We will have more details about the date and location of the live show, should be sometime in November, and, hopefully, some other events that we can do while we have Gretchen in the country."
23,10,Gretchen,"I'm super excited to spend a bunch of time there. I'm sure the weather will be much nicer than Montreal in November. I'll get all the sunshine. And, yeah, looking forward to meeting a bunch of Australian linguists."
23,11,Lauren,The live show is all thanks to our amazing patrons who support us on Patreon. Our latest bonus episode for them was an inside view into the conference circuit. Gretchen and I had caught up about what we've been up to over the last couple of months of conferencing. That episode is available on patreon.com/lingthusiasm.
23,12,Gretchen,"So you can hear about the two different emoji conferences that I went to, and the gesture conference and the International Congress of Linguists that Lauren went to, as well as 17 previous bonus episodes, which is quite a lot of bonus material, if you go to Lingthusiasm on Patreon. [Music]"
23,13,Lauren,Today we're gonna talk about nothing! And it's gonna be great.
23,14,Gretchen,"Actually, this whole episode is just us not saying anything. The rest of it is just silence."
23,15,Lauren,I don't think we're actually capable of doing that. I'm just gonna put it out there.
23,16,Gretchen,"This is like the John Cage 4:33 version of Lingthusiasm, where you put us both ambiently in a room, and we just like, we don't say anything, we eventually -- we just start giggling."
23,17,Lauren,"No, defy science. It's not gonna happen. And the thing is, there's so much to say about nothing because nothing is incredibly meaningful."
23,18,Gretchen,"That's the thing, there is so much to say about nothing. We're gonna to start with pauses."
23,19,Lauren,"Yes, we are gonna start with -- we're gonna move through different kinds of meaningful nothingness in language and what they can tell us about how meaning works and how brains work, but I wanna start with pauses and their importance for conversation. And pauses are actually kind of rare."
23,20,Gretchen,"How rare is rare? Like, does that mean just, like, one person talks a lot and so you can't get a word in edgewise?"
23,21,Lauren,"Well, I think it's English speakers, we have this idea that words are separated by pauses because we have spaces between words to indicate their boundary in written text, but when we speak there's no margin between -- you can't look at a recording spectrogram and see breaks between every word. It's all just run together in a single string."
23,22,Gretchen,"Yeah, so there's not really pauses between words. And even between when one person talks, another person talks, there's often not that much pausing, right?"
23,23,Lauren,"There's actually so little pausing in some interactional -- in many interactional contexts -- that it is too short for the brain to actually, really have prepared for it without doing some clever anticipation about how that person's speech goes, and how interaction goes. So, the average time between me saying something and someone replying is, like, 200 milliseconds, which is, like, the speed of a blink."
23,24,Gretchen,That's really not that much.
23,25,Lauren,"No, it turns out that we're just basically all constantly ready to reply to someone as soon as they have something to say."
23,26,Gretchen,"And we're constantly trying to, like, predict where the pauses are. I was reading this paper about conversation analysis and it said that even if you get up to 500 milliseconds of a pause -- like if I say, 'Hey, Lauren, how's it going?' and then you wait for 500 milliseconds -- which, again, is, like, half a second -- if you don't say anything in that 500 milliseconds, I'm gonna be like, 'Did you understand me? Are you there?' I'm gonna be rephrasing the question like, 'No, seriously, what's up? Is there a problem?' Or, in the case that I run into in Montreal with French, if you don't reply in that 500 milliseconds, people think you don't speak the language and so they'll switch languages."
23,27,Lauren,"Yeah, so a lot of data that I've been looking at for this comes from Nick Enfield's book, How We Talk, which I reviewed a while ago and really enjoyed, and I'm excited to get to talk about it again, because yes, like, a half a second we don't think of as being very long but in a conversation that is ages."
23,28,Gretchen,"Yeah, it's so long, and this is the eternal bane of the language learner because you're like, 'No, no, no, I'm just taking that extra half second to figure out what you're saying and prepare my response.' But because you can't quite do that, that's one of the things that trips people up, makes it hard to speak in another language, which, if you can figure out how to fill that pause with, like, the right filled pause sound, like if you say 'uhh' or 'euhh' or different sounds -- depending on the language, what you say in pauses, sometimes that could be enough to let your brain recover but stay in the language."
23,29,Lauren,"Yeah, you're like, 'Wait, wait, I've got something, I'm just processing, not that I'm ignoring you.' And, interestingly, if you take longer to reply, it often indicates that you're going to say a 'no.' We're very quick to say 'yes,' and in a conversation, the silence before a 'no' is often longer, and it's a way of signalling very subtly to the person you're talking to that they're probably not gonna get the answer they want."
23,30,Gretchen,"Yeah, that's a good point. There's another thing that's really neat, which is our brains are also very good at kind of faking lack of pauses even when there is one? So, when you talk to someone on Skype or on other kinds of internet video chat, Skype often has a little bit of a time delay between you, but you generally don't really notice that. So a way you can notice that time delay if you're talking to someone on Skype, is try counting together. If you try counting, like, 'one, two, three, four, five,' in synchrony, or if you try singing a song together, you'll discover that one person is on an apparent time delay, or you're both on an apparent time delay to each other because you're not actually hearing the person as instantly as you think you are."
23,31,Lauren,And we cope with the transitions. Our brains just kind of do a little mental shift.
23,32,Gretchen,"Yeah, it doesn't seem to bother us that much."
23,33,Lauren,"People talk a lot about how this varies a lot between cultures, and one of the studies from Nick's book looks at the variation in turn-taking and conversation across ten languages and finds that, sure, there is variation in the average amount of time it takes, but that all of them actually fall within, on average, that half a second, 500-millisecond, boundary, and that the variation isn't as massive as we think it is."
23,34,Gretchen,It just feels very important because we're very sensitive to that short amount of time.
23,35,Lauren,Yeah.
23,36,Gretchen,"And you can also get kind of pseudo-pauses in written text, right?"
23,37,Lauren,"Well, it's so necessary to -- because we can just read text at this kind of constant blur, you have to force it to have the breaths and the space that you want to convey, that are very easy to do in spoken language, and require some extra tools in written language."
23,38,Gretchen,"Yeah, I think of this especially in text chat, like if you're talking on, you know, GChat, or WhatsApp, or iMessage, or Facebook chat, or any of the different kinds of instant chat platforms, and every time you put in a new message or a new line break, it's kind of like adding in a pause."
23,39,Lauren,"Yeah, I find it very stressful when people send whatever their contribution to the conversation is as one giant paragraph of text."
23,40,Gretchen,"Oh, yeah!"
23,41,Lauren,"I'm very much like, 'Split it all up, keep it rolling.'"
23,42,Gretchen,"Unless it's, like, the first message, because then you didn't even know they were messaging you."
23,43,Lauren,True.
23,44,Gretchen,"But if you just see the 'is typing' indicator for, like, five minutes, you're like, 'Oh my god, what is this person trying to say?'"
23,45,Lauren,"Something exciting, hopefully! I also like a good ellipsis when you want to, like -- when it's not just this, like, brief, turn-taking pause, it's that you really want to emphasise that you're thinking about something."
23,46,Gretchen,"Yeah, that you wanna kind of link two things together and send them at the same time, but also put a pause in between them."
23,47,Lauren,Yeah.
23,48,Gretchen,So you can put the '...'
23,49,Lauren,"An even more subtle, but more torturous, form of pause in chat and messager is when you have the option to show someone that you've read their message but you haven't replied. I find those kind of chat apps very stressful, and it really, I mean, it's just a reminder that even though we think of online chat as being the same as face-to-face chat and, often, we use it in that kind of immediate 'I say something, you say something' way, it is still not synchronous. It's an asynchronous form of communication. If you said something or asked me a question, and then I went away for a week, and then replied -- face-to-face it is, like, impossible."
23,50,Gretchen,"That's really weird, yeah. But you can leave someone on read in chat or in text messages, and it's like, there are aspects of it that are weird, but there are aspects of it that are maybe less weird, you know?"
23,51,Lauren,And it's mostly just very stressful or irritating if you are banking on a reply.
23,52,Gretchen,"I mean, normally, it happens to me if, like, someone messaged me overnight and I check it first thing in the morning but I'm not quite awake yet, and then I kind of forget. I don't have the energy to type anything yet. Like, you message me from Australia and it's like, 'Oh yeah, here, there's this thing,' and then later in the day I'm like, 'Wait a second. Lauren sent me a message. I should reply that.'"
23,53,Lauren,And it's always the person who started the interaction or is waiting for the reply that has more invested than the person who's not replying.
23,54,Gretchen,"Although, I don't feel so bad because you're always asleep anyway when I wake up so."
23,55,Lauren,That's true. Asynchronous communications works very well when you live asynchronously.
23,56,Gretchen,"That's true. Another type of nothing and pause that I really like is when you can put a pause -- a teeny, tiny, micro pause -- in the middle of a word, or use it as a part of the sounds that are going to create a word."
23,57,Lauren,"So this is no longer part of the kind of turn-taking conversational cut-and-thrust, this is part of the sounds that might make up the alphabet of a language."
23,58,Gretchen,"Like, what if pausing is just another letter of the alphabet? And this is true in a number of languages, and it's also true in some languages that don't so much put it in the alphabet but still integrate into the words. So in the English word 'uh-oh', you can't just say 'uhoh.'"
23,59,Lauren,"You can say 'uhoh,' it just means something weird and different."
23,60,Gretchen,"Because that's, like, not the same thing as 'uh-oh.'"
23,61,Lauren,"It is not the same thing, no."
23,62,Gretchen,"Right. Well, it's not the same thing as 'uh-oh' and 'uhoh.' And so the pause in the middle of 'uh-oh,' even if it's a very tiny 'uh-oh' pause, or you could say 'uh... oh,' that could be a longer pause, but that pause is doing something that's working on it at the word level, because 'uhoh' does not feel like the same word. And so there are a bunch of different sounds that are produced by blocking the flow of air coming out of the mouth. So if you say, like, /b/ or /p/ or /t/ or /k/, those are all produced by creating that blockage with your lips or with your tongue and then letting the air puff out."
23,63,Lauren,"And you can tell that it's a stop because you can really extend that. So you could go 'up...pa' or 'ud...da' or 'ug...ga,' and it's really weird because we obviously don't hold a 'G' for that long when we're saying a word. But hold it, and then you see that it's like everything has stopped, nothing's going forward."
23,64,Gretchen,"Exactly. And so some sounds don't do that. So if you say 'ooo,' or if you say 'ssss,' you can hold on to an 'oooo' or an 'sssss' as long as you have breath to spare."
23,65,Lauren,Yeah.
23,66,Gretchen,"But for /p/ or /b/ or /k/, it's the closure, and it's the release of that closure, or the release of that stop, that makes the sound really happen. And if you hold a 'K' for extra long like, 'uk...ka' that's just an extra period of silence."
23,67,Lauren,I didn't realize you were making a noise then. I thought you just paused.
23,68,Gretchen,"That's the thing, right? Like, I knew that there was this blockage of air happening in my throat but you can't hear that, 'cause nothing's coming out!"
23,69,Lauren,Yep.
23,70,Gretchen,"So one of things that we're doing constantly and not really thinking about is creating these kind of mini blockages, but the biggest of those blockages is the one that happens in 'uh-oh,' which is known as a glottal stop because it's produced with the glottis or the voice box, the vocal cords. And so rather than pause the airflow at your lips or at your tongue, where maybe you can still kind of squeak a little bit of air by, or you can still do other stuff with your mouth to kind of control the air as it's coming out, if you block off the flow of air in your throat, you can't do anything else with your vocal cords, you can't do anything else with your nose, you can't do anything else with your tongue at the same time. You're really just kind of blocking off air in its purest form."
23,71,Lauren,"Nothing is happening, like, nothing is escaping. And if you really want to see what that looks like, thankfully we don't have to cut people open anymore, we have some really great videos in the show notes that show people saying these sounds in an MRI machine. It's pretty amazing. If you click on the little glottal stop, yeah, it's pretty spectacular."
23,72,Gretchen,"And English uses this sound in 'uh-oh' -- and 'uh-oh' is kind of one of those things that's, like, dubiously a word. It's kind of a word, but it's also kind of just one of those sounds that you make."
23,73,Lauren,"It's not a sound in our alphabet. We don't have, like, A-B-C- [...] -E-F-G..."
23,74,Gretchen,"But there are languages that have this sound, the glottal stop, as just a regular sound in their alphabet. One of them is Hawaiian. So if you have the name Hawaii, but in Hawaiian it's pronounced Hawai'i, and the apostrophe that's written in between the two 'I's' is actually indicating that pause. So: /həwaɪʔi/. there's two '[i]' sounds there, and there's a pause in between them. And similarly, one of the islands of Hawaii is O'ahu: /oʔahu/, not /oʊahu/, which would be a different word."
23,75,Lauren,"I have no idea -- so, we should say the glottal stop is part of the International Phonetic Alphabet, because the International Phonetic Alphabet represents every sound that could be in a language, and the symbol for the glottal stop [Ed. note: ʔ], it looks a lot like our logo! We really like glottal stops."
23,76,Gretchen,"Oh, hey, it does! I wonder where we got that idea! So it looks like a question mark without the dot, which is also our logo, because we were trying to pick distinctive symbols. I think we talked about it in one of the first episodes, we talked about where the logo was coming from."
23,77,Lauren,"Probably, but it makes me realise I actually have no idea where the glottal stop symbol comes from."
23,78,Gretchen,"Well, so, the glottal stop as a sound also has this kind of interestingly entangled history with the history of our own alphabet that we use in English. So the English alphabet comes from the Romans, which comes from the Greeks, but before the Greeks, it comes from the Phoenicians --"
23,79,Lauren,"Thanks, Phoenicians."
23,80,Gretchen,"Thanks, Phoenicians! You had some great ships and you had some great alphabet. And what's cool about Phoenician is Phoenician was a Semitic language. It's not spoken anymore, but modern-day Semitic languages include Arabic and Hebrew, and Semitic languages -- and Phoenician is no exception -- for them, consonants are super important, and they don't really care that much about vowels. And so most of the Semitic languages don't bother writing vowels, or they only write some of the vowels, so modern-day Arabic and Hebrew do this, but also ancient Phoenician did this as well. So Phoenician had this letter at the very beginning of the Phoenician alphabet, which was derived from an Egyptian hieroglyph which depicted an ox's head?"
23,81,Lauren,Mm-hmm.
23,82,Gretchen,"Which was known as 'alep, or aleph. And this sound made the sound at the beginning of the word for 'ox's head' --"
23,83,Lauren,/a/?
23,84,Gretchen,"-- which was /ʔalɛf/. No, no, no, it's not /a/, it's the glottal stop, that bit of silence."
23,85,Lauren,"See, because it's not a part of my language's sound system, I'm very bad at perceiving it."
23,86,Gretchen,"And it's really hard to hear at the beginning of a word because, of course, at the beginning of the word, what precedes a word is often just silence, and it's really hard to hear the difference between silence and a glottal stop that's intended."
23,87,Lauren,I'm gonna blame my own phonemic limitations rather than the quality of our video chat.
23,88,Gretchen,"I think you can blame your brain for this one, because even when I try to produce it I'm like, 'I'm just not doing anything,' but at the beginning of this /ʔalɛf/ was this glottal stop, and Phoenician used this letter aleph for the glottal stop."
23,89,Lauren,Mmm!
23,90,Gretchen,"And then, when the Phoenician alphabet was borrowed into Greek, they were like, 'Well, A of all, we don't have a glottal stop in our language, and B of all, we do have all these vowels and they're pretty important for us.'"
23,91,Lauren,"I'm really feeling the Greeks right now, like, yeah, great."
23,92,Gretchen,"Yeah. They might have been like you, Lauren, and they might have been like, 'I can't even hear this sound, but do you know what I can hear? It's this other sound, this /a/ sound, let's just use this letter to write this /a/ sound that we have. But what's actually very interesting is that at a later period, Arabic underwent the same process where they started writing -- so modern-day Arabic alif is actually used for the /a/ sound, and there's just some kind of, like, weird historical writing quirk relics that make it sometimes also stand for this glottal stop sound, and modern-day Arabic uses a different symbol, which is known as hamza -- it looks kind of like a little ""C' with an extra line on the bottom, but it's a tiny 'C' -- and that's used for the real glottal stop when you want to make sure that's what you're talking about. So, if you have a word like /miʔa/, 'hundred' in Arabic, that pause in the middle of /miʔa/, that's your glottal stop, and it's written with this hamza instead. And Lauren, to come back to your question about where the IPA symbol comes from, which looks like this dotless question mark, that kind of 'C' shape with the extra line is where the creators of the International Phonetic Alphabet got the idea to make some sort of C-ish type shape for the glottal stop in the IPA."
23,93,Lauren,"Huh, I kind of see it now. It's really nifty."
23,94,Gretchen,"So that's really neat. So there's this hidden connection between IPA, and between Arabic, and the modern English alphabet, they kind of go around in a circle and they all influence each other."
23,95,Lauren,"So far, we've talked about nothingness that is still a sound. It's the absence of sound, nothingness, but now we are moving into pure nothingness. We're not talking about sounds. We're talking about an absence of sound, but that still has a meaning behind it."
23,96,Gretchen,This is getting really metaphysical.
23,97,Lauren,It is. But now we're gonna go back and I'm gonna give you an English grammar test. Are you ready?
23,98,Gretchen,"Okay, okay."
23,99,Lauren,"So if I say the word 'cats,' can you break the word 'cats' or 'dogs' down into meaningful units?"
23,100,Gretchen,"Okay. So you have the 'cat' unit, which refers to the animal, and you have the /s/ unit, which refers to there being more than one of them."
23,101,Lauren,Okay. Exactly what I wanted to hear. Great work.
23,102,Gretchen,Yay!
23,103,Lauren,"So we can break words down into -- you passed the English grammar test. It was very gruelling. So we can break words down into parts, and those parts have meaning. You don't see /s/ floating around by itself, it always has to hang out with a noun to make more than one of that noun, but it has its meaning. Now, if I gave you the word 'cat' or 'dog,' can you divide that down into meaningful parts?"
23,104,Gretchen,"I mean, there's just the one. It still means the animal."
23,105,Lauren,"Okay. So we can't divide that down anymore. It would be like splitting an atom, you'd be left with little atomic parts that don't have any meaning on their own."
23,106,Gretchen,"I mean, like, /k/ and /æ/ and /t/, but those are sounds and by themselves they don't do anything."
23,107,Lauren,"Yeah. So if I said, 'The cat on the wall,' and this sounds like a trick question, but how many are there?"
23,108,Gretchen,On the wall? There's one cat on the wall?
23,109,Lauren,"Yeah. And if I said, 'The cats on the wall,' how many are there?"
23,110,Gretchen,There's more than one?
23,111,Lauren,Okay. So the --
23,112,Gretchen,How are these cats getting on the wall?
23,113,Lauren,"They're very agile cats, and it's a sunny wall."
23,114,Gretchen,"Oh, that kind of wall, like an outdoor wall, not an indoor, inside wall."
23,115,Lauren,Yeah. We'll have to have talk about the semantic range of 'wall' after this episode.
23,116,Gretchen,I had a very interesting mental picture.
23,117,Lauren,"But back to the important bit, which is the bits of the word, so /s/ means more than one. You know, though, if I don't use a /s/, that I'm talking about one cat."
23,118,Gretchen,"Right. And there's nothing that -- you're not saying, 'The one cat on the wall,' or 'One cat on the wall,' there's nothing there that's telling you there's only one of them. It's just the fact that I --"
23,119,Lauren,'The cat' or 'the cats.'
23,120,Gretchen,"It's the fact that I know that /s/ is an option, and you decided not to use that option."
23,121,Lauren,"Yes, and I have to use that option. It's not like it's optional if I'm talking about -- I can't say 'the seven cat.' That sounds silly."
23,122,Gretchen,Right.
23,123,Lauren,So 'S' --
23,124,Gretchen,Or 'The one cats'
23,125,Lauren,"I mean, yeah, you can't use that without being ungrammatical in English. And so /s/ has meaning, but the absence of it, the absence of the plural, also has meaning for English speakers."
23,126,Gretchen,Right. And it has potentially different kinds of meaning depending on which kind of word has that absence.
23,127,Lauren,"Yeah. So in terms of the plurals, it means it's not plural, it just means singular."
23,128,Gretchen,"But if I say something like, 'I like the cat,' versus, 'I liked the cat,' then now, you have a difference between --"
23,129,Lauren,"Oh, no! What did the cat do? I hope it didn't have a problem with the wall."
23,130,Gretchen,"It destroyed my wall and I have a grudge! So now I've changed 'like' and 'liked,' and so I've got this contrast between 'like' plus the /t/ sound, which is spelled 'e-d' but it's only pronounced /t/, and 'like' without anything, and now the absence of anything means that it's present, not that it's singular."
23,131,Lauren,"Yeah, so it's not that the absence always means exactly the same thing everywhere in the way that /s/ doesn't. You know, 'She eats' doesn't refer to the fact that it's a single person necessarily, it refers to the fact that it's a single third person present verb so, just in the way that, like, /s/ --"
23,132,Gretchen,"Or, 'The cat's pyjamas' can be a singular cat possessing the pyjamas."
23,133,Lauren,"Yeah, it could be possessive /s/. So this nothingness doesn't have to mean the same thing everywhere depending on the thing it's contrasting with, and we know that this is a particularly important feature of English because it's not true for all languages. So one language that I learnt briefly in high school is Indonesian, and Indonesian is known -- especially in kind of everyday, informal language -- for not marking plurals at all, which is a thing that sounds strange to English speakers, but English does lots of things that sounds strange to grammars of other languages, and so --"
23,134,Gretchen,"I think, yeah, other languages don't mark plurals as well. I can't think of any off the top of my head but I'm sure there are some."
23,135,Lauren,"Ah, there's plenty that don't mark plurals. It's just that when something is obligatory in your language it's very hard to imagine other languages not paying it the same attention, and so in Indonesian there's no zero absence that is important for contrasting the singular, because the plural is not a thing that it contrasts with."
23,136,Gretchen,"There are a few words in English where this happens, so if you have, like, 'one deer' or 'two deer', or, like, 'one sheep' and 'two sheep,' now, 'sheep' and 'deer' don't have the absence meaning something because for those particular words there's no difference between the singular and the plural."
23,137,Lauren,"No, and we get by. I mean, I don't personally talk about sheep a lot in my day-to-day life."
23,138,Gretchen,But you could. That just means you're not an insomniac because you're not counting sheep.
23,139,Lauren,"Yeah, and so what counts as needing this kind of meaningful nothingness in one language may not necessarily need it in another language. And this is so prevalent across languages, this idea that not marking something has a meaning, that it's called a 'zero morph' and it actually has its own symbol."
23,140,Gretchen,"So it's the 'zero morpheme' or the 'null morpheme,' and it gets a fancy symbol."
23,141,Lauren,"It's the same symbol, if you're a maths person, as the empty set symbol or, if you're a speaker of a Scandinavian language, it's like an O with a line through it. [Ed. note: ∅]"
23,142,Gretchen,"Yeah, so it's that simple with the line through it, like, the extra-clarifying zero or empty set or null. So one thing where the null morpheme really comes in handy is if you have something where in one language a particular set of meaning corresponds to a morpheme that's right there, so if you had a language where the singular got one marker and the plural got another marker and they are both very visible or audible and then you wanted to translate that, or produce a version of it that was parallel in two different languages, you could say, 'Well, this thing that is null in English actually corresponds to this particular morpheme in another language.'"
23,143,Lauren,"It's very possible in English that we could have had an extra bit of a word that was like, 'catten' versus 'cats' and '-en' overtly marked a singular."
23,144,Gretchen,"Yeah, absolutely, we could totally have done that, and especially, if you get languages where you have other kinds of markers like gender markers or case markers on your nouns, then sometimes you have a very broad system of -- if you have something, like, in Latin if you have 'cattus' versus 'catti,' so 'cattus' is a singular cat, a nominative singular cat, and 'catti' is a nominative plural cat, and so there your '-us' and your '-i' are both -- one's indicating singular and the other one's indicating plural. Although, I'll have to note that's the, that's the late Latin, Vulgar Latin, for cat and the older, classical Latin was 'felis,' but that doesn't really matter at this point."
23,145,Lauren,"I was really interested in, like, whether this was some kind of new idea, because the the null set symbol has only been around since, like, the 1930s, so I had a look at how long linguists have been talking about this kind of zero for. Have a guess, Gretchen."
23,146,Gretchen,"Wow, I have no idea! I mean, it seems like something that's definitely always been part of my linguistics education that you have null morphemes, so it's definitely not in the past decade or two!"
23,147,Lauren,Okay.
23,148,Gretchen,"So let's, I don't know, let's say, like, the '60s? A lot of stuff happened in linguistics in the '60s."
23,149,Lauren,"Well, you're not 2,500 years old, so you probably don't remember when Panini started using it in his grammar of Sanskrit."
23,150,Gretchen,You led me on by saying this was from the 1930s.
23,151,Lauren,"I did lead you on, it was very sneaky of me. But we haven't talked about Panini much on the show, but he's worth giving a shoutout to because he wrote the first grammar of Sanskrit, like, over 2000 years ago, and it's kind of been something that grammarians have constantly come back to as a model for how to analyse language."
23,152,Gretchen,"Is it the oldest grammar ever or just, like, one of the oldest grammars that we know about ever?"
23,153,Lauren,"It's the oldest grammar that we know about, you know, proper grammatical tradition."
23,154,Gretchen,"So shout-out to Panini for doing this, and he invented the null morpheme? What did he say about them?"
23,155,Lauren,He came up with the idea in his paradigm of Sanskrit verbs that the absence of a particular marking had a meaning.
23,156,Gretchen,"Good job, Panini."
23,157,Lauren,Good work him!
23,158,Gretchen,"And the last case that I find super exciting about where nothing can mean something is that -- this is a case of a nothing that doesn't sound like anything, but it influences how other things around it sound."
23,159,Lauren,"Oh, so we're no longer even talking about -- we're talking about the way it affects other things. Excellent."
23,160,Gretchen,"But we know it's there because it affects the other things around it. So, Lauren, I need a book title for an example sentence for you. What's a book you like?"
23,161,Lauren,"Okay. One of my favourite, like, language-y books that I like to read, I really like Ella Minnow Pea."
23,162,Gretchen,"Oh my god, that's so good! I love that book. Okay, we're gonna use Ella Minnow Pea. It's 'Ella Minnow Pea,' like the girl's name, and the fish, and the vegetable. It's a great book about language. You guys should totally read it. I think we've both written reviews about it, actually."
23,163,Lauren,"I'm very fond of it. It's a kid's book, but it's compelling."
23,164,Gretchen,"It's like a young adult book. It's got chapters. So here's an example sentence, if I say, 'I want to read Ella Minnow Pea.'"
23,165,Lauren,You are correct.
23,166,Gretchen,"Perfectly good sentence. I can also say, 'I wanna read Ella Minnow Pea,' so I can say 'want to' or 'wanna,' both of those are totally reasonable sounding sentences. I could also say, 'I want all of our listeners to read Ella Minnow Pea.'"
23,167,Lauren,Agree.
23,168,Gretchen,"Still a good sentence. And then I could ask you, Lauren, 'Who do you want to read Ella Minnow Pea?'"
23,169,Lauren,Everybody!
23,170,Gretchen,"Everybody! But then, I could ask you, 'Who do you wanna read Ella Minnow Pea?'"
23,171,Lauren,"Hang on. Wait, wait, wait, what? 'Who do I wanna...'"
23,172,Gretchen,'Who do you wanna read Ella Minnow Pea?'
23,173,Lauren,That sentence doesn't -- it's missing something.
23,174,Gretchen,"It's weird, right?"
23,175,Lauren,"It makes it sound like you're asking Ella Minnow Pea who it wants to read, but it's a book, it can't read anything. Gretchen?"
23,176,Gretchen,"Like, 'Who do you wanna read, Ella? Ella, who do you wanna read?' Right? It doesn't make any sense, and it's really weird because we think of 'want to' and 'wanna' as meaning the exact same thing, right? Like, 'I wanna read,' 'I want to read,' those are the same thing, just one's more informal than the other."
23,177,Lauren,"I would say there is, there is no difference between them."
23,178,Gretchen,"It just seems like it's only a formality difference, that's it, right? But then, when you get this other sentence, you're like, 'Wait a second. It doesn't work.' So let's break down what's in that sentence again. So we have the sentence, 'Who do you want to read Ella Minnow Pea?' And the answer to that is, 'I want our listeners to read Ella Minnow Pea."" So there's something in the statement version of that, there's something in between the ""want' and the 'to,' and that's the 'our listeners.' Whereas, in 'I want to read Ella Minnow Pea,' there's nothing in between there. You might be able to say, 'I want me to read Ella Minnow Pea,' but that's not really an English sentence. So you could also ask the sentence as, 'You want who to read Ella Minnow Pea?' And again, there's the 'who.'"
23,179,Lauren,"Yes, I mean, it sounds weird."
23,180,Gretchen,"I mean, it relies on a certain pragmatic context --"
23,181,Lauren,But I can answer it.
23,182,Gretchen,"It relies on a certain pragmatic context. You could say, 'You want who to read Ella Minnow Pea?' That's okay."
23,183,Lauren,"Yeah, when I unveil my plan for everybody to read it."
23,184,Gretchen,"You unveil your plan for world domination via literature. So there's this sense that there is something that logically belongs in between the 'want' and the 'to' in that second set of sentences and not in the first set, and that something could be 'listeners,' could be 'who,' could be 'you,' particularly Lauren, like, 'I want Lauren to read Ella Minnow Pea.'"
23,185,Lauren,"But there's nothing there, Gretchen."
23,186,Gretchen,"There's a sense that there's a word there, and yet clearly there's not a word there because the 'who' is actually at the beginning of the sentence. So there's nothing there, but that nothing, whatever that nothing is that's there, is preventing the 'want' and the 'to' from smooshing into each other."
23,187,Lauren,Wow.
23,188,Gretchen,It's really weird.
23,189,Lauren,This is most meaningfully nothing-y nothing that we've got.
23,190,Gretchen,"Right? And so, you can do this in all sorts of sentences. It generally requires a 'wanna,' but you can say something like, 'Who will I want to see?' 'Who will I wanna see?' These are fine. 'Who will I want to go to the store?' 'Who will I wanna go to the store?' No."
23,191,Lauren,You just changed sentences halfway through. 'Who will I -- Wanna go to the store?'
23,192,Gretchen,"Well, that's fine."
23,193,Gretchen,"It's a restart, but, 'Who will I wanna go to the store?' It's just like, 'Wait, it crashed. What happened? What did you do to me?' And that's a piece of evidence, and some theories of linguistics call this piece of nothing that's in between 'want' and 'to,' call it a 'trace,' like the 'who,' which you could put there, you could say, 'You want who to read?' But now you have 'who' at the beginning, 'Who do you want to read?' The 'who' that's at the beginning of the sentence left its trace in between 'want' and 'to,' and that's the thing that's preventing 'want' and 'to' from glomming into each other, and this is such a weird and interesting phenomenon that there are actually a couple different videos about this, so we can link to those as well if you want to see it demonstrated in front of you, if you want the visual, and I think the visual does help."
23,194,Lauren,"So we've gone from nothing and the absence of something between people speaking, we've gone to the absence of sound as a sound, we've gone to the absence of a part of a word as a meaningful part of a word, and we've ended up with the absence of something in a sentence appearing to make a sentence have a different meaning."
23,195,Gretchen,"Yeah, there's all these things that nothing really does mean something, as long as you control the context and the something very, very carefully. [Music]"

24,2,Gretchen,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics. I'm Gretchen McCulloch, and I'm here with Dr. Hilaria Cruz, who is a Neukom Fellow at Dartmouth College and just starting as an assistant professor in linguistics at the University of Louisville, and is a native speaker of Chatino who works with Chatino as well. Welcome, Hilaria."
24,3,Hilaria,"Well, thank you. Hello, everyone!"
24,4,Gretchen,Thank you so much for being here!
24,5,Hilaria,You are welcome.
24,6,Gretchen,"I'm here because you invited me down for a workshop at Dartmouth, and so I'm going to talk about that as well. But first, let's start with: How did you get into linguistics?"
24,7,Hilaria,"As a native speaker of Chatino, I grew up in a community where we all spoke Chatino, and then it came time for us to go to school, and then my father says, 'Well, I would like you to get an education.' So my father then says, 'We're going to go to this other town named Juquila so you guys can go to school.' We came to Juquila and, at a time in the 1970s, the Mexican government wanted indigenous children to study, so they developed these, like, boarding schools -- well, it was like a boarding house where indigenous children that came from the outskirts of the Spanish-speaking towns had room and board while they went to public school. So my family came to this, what is called 'the houses' there, and I was sent to elementary school not knowing a word of Spanish. It was complete immersion."
24,8,Gretchen,Wow.
24,9,Hilaria,"At the time, there was just one school in that little town, just one elementary school for -- I would say, I'm just guessing, 5,000 people. There were many children. There were some children that went to school in the morning. There were some children that were going to school in the evening. Since I did not know that much Spanish, my father took me there and introduced me to this class. The teacher was nice, and then I -- just as a warm-up, he let me go there for a few mornings. I would just go, just for a few hours."
24,10,Gretchen,How old were you?
24,11,Hilaria,I think that I was about seven.
24,12,Gretchen,Mm-hmm.
24,13,Hilaria,"I would just hang out for a few hours, and I would just take off and go back to the boarding house, where my parents were also staying with us. And then the teacher says, 'Oh, this is fine. But I think that you are ready to begin your regular classes now. So you are going to come to school from 2:00 to 6:00.' Then I began to get really sad, because I did not want to go to school because I used to get bored, just to sit down there and just not understand what the teacher says. Then I began to go to these evening classes, and I was not happy. So then I decided that I want to go back to the morning class, because it was the same teacher teaching first grade in the morning and then in the evening. I will go back, and he will welcome me. 'Aha, yes, come in.' I will go for two, three hours in the morning, as much as I wanted. Then, I will go back again, back home, and, to me -- that was the happy medium for me. At some point, then, he stopped me, and he says, 'No, no, no, no. You cannot set up your own time. You must come back here, to school.' So I --"
24,14,Gretchen,"You go to school, you play the rules."
24,15,Hilaria,"Yes. To me school was just horrible. But I guess I persisted, and I got really bored, and I guess I passed, and then I -- when we got to sixth grade there was -- I guess in that school it was only a middle school, but, actually, my family and I were not happy in that town because that was the first place where I encountered racism against Native people. Because in my community, I was just a member of society, right? But when we got to school, kids began to pinch me, and they will call me 'india' and things like that. So I will come back to my father and say, 'Why is it that these kids are saying this to me? Why is it that they are pinching me and pounding me?' Because I just did not understand."
24,16,Gretchen,Yeah.
24,17,Hilaria,"Then my father would say, 'But you know, every time they tell you that, just be proud of yourself.' But how can a kid to be proud of -- how can you be proud if somebody is stopping you, right? That was my experience in that town. It was like a frontier town. There was a lot of racism towards the Chatino people, who live in the outskirts of that town. So then I told my father and my siblings too, 'You know what? We're not happy in this town.' Then he told us, 'Well, I understand that you're not happy. Let's go to the city.' We went to the city. And there was a more cosmopolitan -- we lived in a small area of the city where there were a lot of migrants from indigenous communities, so it was better. I continued my education. My father and I talked, and he encouraged me to continue college because he told me that in college, it'll be a lot of fun. That in college, I will be able to talk to other people, and meet a lot of people, so I was excited about going to college. I continued my education because I wanted to meet interesting people in college. That was the whole goal."
24,18,Gretchen,It's a good goal. I like that goal.
24,19,Hilaria,"I wanted to have interesting conversations, meet interesting people in college."
24,20,Gretchen,Yeah. That's great. I like that.
24,21,Hilaria,I think that my father was really smart for doing that.
24,22,Gretchen,He knew you very well.
24,23,Hilaria,"Yeah, I think so. So my goal was to get to college, and have wonderful conversations, and meet interesting people."
24,24,Gretchen,Mm-hmm.
24,25,Hilaria,"I continued going to college. Then, in 1991, I came to the United States. I began to hear conversations about linguists working with Native American languages, reviving these moribund languages, and then I began to think, 'You know what? Maybe linguists will be able to help me create an alphabet for the Chatino language.' Because I was very curious about how to represent the Chatino languages, but the only thing that I was familiar with was the Spanish alphabet."
24,26,Gretchen,Right.
24,27,Hilaria,"But since these languages come from such different linguistic families, Spanish does not have all of the symbols to be able to represent a tonal language, let's say like Chatino. We would try to write it down, but when it came time to read it, we could not read it."
24,28,Gretchen,It's kind of unsatisfying.
24,29,Hilaria,"So there was something missing there. I began to think, 'You know what? This sounds very interesting. I think that linguists could help me maybe find a way to write the Chatino language.' I began to write to different linguists. I would write them letters and say, 'Yes. Could you please help me develop an alphabet for my language?'"
24,30,Gretchen,"And this is 1991, so you're writing letters."
24,31,Hilaria,"Ah, well it was --"
24,32,Gretchen,Or emails maybe?
24,33,Hilaria,"-- letter. It was letter. I was writing emails around 2000, or something like that. It wasn't in 1991. So I began to write these letters in 2000. My sister, Emiliana, also was on the same path. It was interesting because my sister Emiliana -- I would talk about all these things, and I said that I was the first one, but, quietly, she had the same idea. She was more proactive. Well, we were both working on our own ends."
24,34,Gretchen,"Oh, interesting."
24,35,Hilaria,"Yeah. So Emiliana was in Oaxaca City then. She had a little coffee shop down there. And there walks in this American guy, whose name is Joel Sherzer. The professor Joel Sherzer, he used to teach at the University of Texas in the anthropology department. Joel Sherzer is a wonderful, very friendly guy. Joel Sherzer began to strike up a conversation with Emiliana, and then Joel asked Emiliana, 'Tell me about you. What are you interested in?' So then Emiliana says, 'Well, you know what? I would love to be able to study my language.' And Joel says, 'Well, that sounds very interesting. Tell me more about it because we at the University of Texas are very interested in working with native speakers of Mexico. Actually, we're creating a program. Why don't you come and visit us --"
24,36,Gretchen,Oh my god.
24,37,Hilaria,"-- at the University of Texas?' So Emiliana went to Texas. She joined the anthropology department at the University of Texas. Emiliana began her program at the University of Texas, and we were just all very excited because then we met Anthony Woodbury, who was very interested in working with us with Chatino. And then Emiliana says, 'Well, you know, in our studies of Chatino we need linguists. I think that you should join the linguistics department.'"
24,38,Gretchen,So she recruited you to do the 'stics part?
24,39,Hilaria,"Yeah! So then I say, 'Sure! Yeah, I would love to do that.'"
24,40,Gretchen,Okay. Is she your older sister?
24,41,Hilaria,She's younger.
24,42,Gretchen,"Oh, wow!"
24,43,Hilaria,"Well, she always tells me what to do. So that is how I joined the linguistics department. I was doing fieldwork with them. I was not a linguistics student or anything like that. I was just like -- I accompanied them because I was just so excited they were studying Chatino, and this is something that I always wanted to do. So I began to do fieldwork. I pay my own way, and I just wait over there."
24,44,Gretchen,Oh my god. So you were like the consultant? They were asking you questions about Chatino?
24,45,Hilaria,"No, no, no, no."
24,46,Gretchen,You were just doing it with them for fun?
24,47,Hilaria,"I was just doing it for fun. No, but they also did -- and this was in the summer of 2003 -- they did fieldwork. I mean, Emiliana was in school. I was not. I was just like a labourer, someone who was so excited about this, you know? Because this was always what I wanted to do, right? I was just so excited about it. So Emiliana told me, 'Hey, we're going to go down there, and we're going to do fieldwork.' And I said, 'I'll come.' I pay my own way. I went there. Since Emiliana had placed this idea of me that I needed to study linguistics, then I asked Tony, 'Hey, do you think that I could join the Linguistics Department?' And then he says to me, 'Well, you're going to have to apply, but if you're ready to work hard, we might accept you.'"
24,48,Gretchen,Did you speak English at this point?
24,49,Hilaria,"Yes, I did."
24,50,Gretchen,"Oh, okay."
24,51,Hilaria,So that's how I began to study linguistics.
24,52,Gretchen,"Oh, that's cool. So then you became a grad student at University of Texas."
24,53,Hilaria,This is how I began a graduate [degree] in linguistics at the University of Texas in Austin.
24,54,Gretchen,"Oh, cool. That's really neat. And then you wrote a dissertation about Chatino and learned a lot of stuff, including how to write it?"
24,55,Hilaria,"Yeah. So one of the things that I wanted to do was to describe the poetics of Chatino where, at the time, I would call it poetics. One of the things that I grew up with, and what Joel Sherzer called verbal art, is what he calls it."
24,56,Gretchen,Speech...
24,57,Hilaria,"He wrote a book on speech play and verbal art. This is the title of a book that Sherzer wrote, but basically he used to call it verbal art."
24,58,Gretchen,"Verbal art. Oh, yeah."
24,59,Hilaria,"So what he meant by verbal art is just to take into account the different types of speech styles that exist in one community. And one of the things that I saw in growing up in San Juan Quiahije is that there are so many different types of discourse. We have ceremonial discourse. We have political discourse. We have dialogues, you know, exchanges. I wanted to record some of those discourses because some of those -- so what gets transmitted in many of those discourses is the need to preserve tradition. For example, there's always a pair of lines that the orator says. This is our tradition. This is what the elders left for us since the foundation of the community, since the foundation of the mountains, and to leave this tradition will be seen as bad. So as a Chatino speaker, every time I hear these ceremonial speeches, they resonate with me a lot. So I wanted to record us. The first assignment that I had in the first moment when I was in graduate school was I proposed to record political speech. I went back to my community. I recorded political speech, and the change in the authority. I did my master's thesis on that. And then for my dissertation, I did an ethnography of speech. I described the different patterns and structures --"
24,60,Gretchen,"Oh, like all the different genres?"
24,61,Hilaria,The different genres. And it was describing the ecosystem of the different styles --
24,62,Gretchen,"Oh, that's interesting!"
24,63,Hilaria,"-- of speech in the community. And I worked with very gifted and talented speakers. This is something that I really wanted to do, and it was a lot of work, but it was, I think, very important work. So I have the basis now to be able to continue that kind of work for other people to do the same."
24,64,Gretchen,"Yeah. So we can we can link to your dissertation. But that's also how you got into, 'Oh my gosh, it's really hard to work with audio data.'"
24,65,Hilaria,"That is right! Because it was hard for two reasons to be able to transcribe speech. I was, of course, a native speaker of the language so I knew what they were saying, but the problem was, when it was time to commit this language onto paper, that I was just a beginning writer. I mean, we were just in stages of developing the alphabet for the language, and then also learning linguistics. And then Anthony would worry. He is very meticulous at what he does, so he will say, 'Well, what is the alphabet that you want to use?' There were like two or three choices of alphabet, so if you're going to choose one, you're going to have to be consistent. I was just beginning."
24,66,Gretchen,That is so hard for a beginner too.
24,67,Hilaria,"It was just -- it was tough. But another thing that I noticed was that it was just very time-consuming to be able to be transcribing these texts. This is something that I began to realise when I began to transcribe this text. In my dissertation, I offer transcriptions of five to six ceremonial texts. All of these are semi-long texts."
24,68,Gretchen,You mean long speeches?
24,69,Hilaria,"Yeah, these are long speeches, and different genres."
24,70,Gretchen,"Yeah. Because I know when we're doing -- for the podcast, we make transcriptions for the podcast. We put the audio onto YouTube, actually, and we use YouTube's automatic speech recognition to create the first draft of the transcript. And then we have a person who goes in and corrects it because there're all these corrections you need to make. For one thing, YouTube never recognises the name of the podcast, Lingthusiasm, because it's not a real word."
24,71,Hilaria,Yeah.
24,72,Gretchen,"And so it gives us these crazy things about, like, 'link Suzy azzam.' Like, who is Suzy? Why is she here? But we're lucky because we have automatic --"
24,73,Hilaria,You're lucky!
24,74,Gretchen,-- transcripts.
24,75,Hilaria,At least! At least you have -- this is news to me. This is the first time I heard the process by which you do transcription.
24,76,Gretchen,"But it still takes hours, and we're still paying a human to do hours of detailed work making the transcripts, even though we cut out half of it by having an automatic thing create the first draft that that person can then fix."
24,77,Hilaria,"That is so interesting. I wish I had a tool like that for Chatino, you know? At least something that could help me -- just to give me a little help so I won't get carpal tunnel."
24,78,Gretchen,"My gosh! Yeah, I bet. And it's probably hard for you to hire Chatino-speaking research assistants here in the US because I don't imagine there are a lot of them."
24,79,Hilaria,"Well, it's not only that, but since in Mexico, as part of the creation of the nation state, their policy has been to integrate indigenous people into this national language, which is Spanish. So then when students go to school, the language of instruction is Spanish."
24,80,Gretchen,Right.
24,81,Hilaria,They don't know how to read and write in Chatino.
24,82,Gretchen,"So even if they're speaking Chatino, you have to teach them how to read and write first?"
24,83,Hilaria,"Yes, that's right. If they can be of, you know, help."
24,84,Gretchen,"Yeah, absolutely. And that's part of what you're doing this weekend?"
24,85,Hilaria,"That is right, yes. So then what happened, we continued to do research at the University of Texas, and we developed a very strong program of Chatino studies there. We used to call ourselves the Chatino Gang. There have been like eight dissertations on different Chatino languages that came out of the University of Texas from one or two very sporadic works in Chatino. There were like eight very in-depth studies. And one of those works was by Lynn Hou and Kate Mesh. They were studying sign language and gesture. Lynn Hou is a signer herself, and she will use transcribers in any spoken language, whether it's English, Spanish, or Chatino."
24,86,Gretchen,Right.
24,87,Hilaria,"So she was doing her dissertation on language acquisition in socialisation of deaf children in San Quiahije, in my community. She asked me to transcribe the audio interviews that she was doing with the families. And these were really lengthy interviews. But then I took that very seriously because, like I said, I'm Lynn's ears, and I have to do this transcription really faithfully so she can get access to this language. So in taking that work really seriously to allow her access, I began to do the transcription. But then, at that point, it became to me much more important to be able to have some tool that could help me because it was just a lot of work. So then I made a comment on Facebook, 'Hey, you know what? I see that automatic speech recognition, it's just very developed in English and all of these languages, how can we get a tool to be able to transcribe this text in Chatino?' I really don't care. I would love to just have a tool that says things in Chatino because they were repeating these things, 'cha, cha,' all the time, and it was just like, 'Oh my god. I just want to have something that could at least recognize a few words so that I don't have to type all of these words.'"
24,88,Gretchen,"I mean, because the estimates that I've seen for how long it takes to do a transcript are like one hour of transcriber work for one minute of audio."
24,89,Hilaria,Yes.
24,90,Gretchen,"And that's the kind of work -- so if someone has an hour of audio data, that's 60 hours of work to try to transcribe that one hour."
24,91,Hilaria,That's right. No.
24,92,Gretchen,Which is ridiculous!
24,93,Hilaria,"Yeah, it's very labourious. So then I began to ask people. In talking with some linguists, they will say, 'Well, it's very difficult to do speech recognition in small languages,' because the models such as forced alignment, which is a model that they had been using at the time, needed hundreds if not thousands of hours of text, and we did not have that."
24,94,Gretchen,"That's the whole point of it being a small language, you don't have those kinds of resources."
24,95,Hilaria,"Yes. So then I began to think, 'Well, how can we make it -- how can we speakers of minority languages make it, or facilitate, or invite these people who are doing this automatic speech recognition research to be able to do collaborations and to help us create tools?' So then I went to several meetings, and I met the people who ran Linguist List, Damir Cavar and Gosia Cavar. It seems like they have some interest in doing ASR, and it seems like when I talked to them, and I told them about the problem, that they said, 'Oh yes, I think that this could be possible.' It seems like it wasn't a challenge for them. They invited me to IU, Indiana University, and one of the interesting things that we did with Damir and Gosia there, which I did not encounter before, was that Damir thought that we could entice people who were doing computational linguistics if we offer some data in open access."
24,96,Gretchen,Okay.
24,97,Hilaria,"So then what I did there was that we had a little recording, and then I re-spoke many of the texts that I had transcribed for my dissertation first. I re-read them. Then we put them again into ELAN, and then we put all their -- we annotated them with parts of speech, and cut and paste."
24,98,Gretchen,So you re-spoke them like in an audio booth so you'd have higher sound quality? Or was it just slower?
24,99,Hilaria,"Well, we didn't have an audio booth. It was just a nice recorder."
24,100,Gretchen,Like a nice quiet room compared to being outside where they weren't even recorded the first time?
24,101,Hilaria,"Yes, it was a nice recording. And we had a good tape recorder basically."
24,102,Gretchen,"Oh, okay, okay."
24,103,Hilaria,So I re- spoke them in a --
24,104,Gretchen,"Like high quality, slow..."
24,105,Hilaria,"Yeah, something like that. I tried to re-read the text. And so we compiled a corpus of 3.5 hours, which we put in this program called GORILLA, where people can just download it, and they can use it to do any type of research that they want to. I thought that that was very clever and -- because Damir says, 'Well, we need to allow people to have a nice corpus so that they can use it if they wish to add a different language into their models.'"
24,106,Gretchen,And so do people start using it?
24,107,Hilaria,"This is how I came into contact with the people that I'm working with right now. At some point -- also, Alexis Michaud, who works on a group of languages called Yongning Na, he was also asking the same question. He's a linguist, he's a phonetician, and he was working with these languages, and he also wanted to do some automatic speech recognition for the languages that he was working with."
24,108,Gretchen,Where are they spoken?
24,109,Hilaria,In China.
24,110,Gretchen,In China. Okay.
24,111,Hilaria,"Yes. The Na languages are spoken in China, so he also put some high-quality data out --"
24,112,Gretchen,"Out there on the internet, yeah."
24,113,Hilaria,"Yeah, out there in the internet. And that is how he got connected with Oliver Adams, who is one of the co-organizers for this conference that I'm doing right now. So Oliver Adams got in touch with..."
24,114,Gretchen,Alexis.
24,115,Hilaria,"With Alexis. So they began to do this collaboration, but then it came time when they wanted to fit the model with another language that was also a tonal language. We had this corpus that we had developed with Linguist List, which was --"
24,116,Gretchen,Chatino.
24,117,Hilaria,"-- Chatino with open access with one speaker, me --"
24,118,Gretchen,Which is also a tonal language.
24,119,Hilaria,Which is also a tonal language.
24,120,Gretchen,It's completely unrelated to this language in China.
24,121,Hilaria,"Yeah, and actually it's spoken by a comparable size of population, like 40,000 people, kind of like that, 40-50,000 people. So that is how we began this collaboration."
24,122,Gretchen,"And so is the idea to make tools that could work regardless of what the language is? Or you have to kind of -- so it'll work on Yongning Na, it'll work on Chatino, it'll work on some other language, it doesn't matter? Or is it to figure out how much data you need to train a very small amount of data, and then it works specifically on the language?"
24,123,Hilaria,"Yes. Well, actually the methods that Oliver Adams is using is neural networks."
24,124,Gretchen,"Oh, okay."
24,125,Hilaria,"Yes. So he developed this software called Persephone. With Persephone, then, you can input data on -- I guess in this case he was interested in tonal languages, so maybe he developed some tools so that the model could recognise tonal languages. That's why he fed two tonal languages into the model, to see what kind of outputs they had. It seems like with the corpus that Alexis was working with, the output was just excellent, because he used more data. But the output in Chatino was also very good. It's very promising."
24,126,Gretchen,So it's useful for you to take a first draft of a transcript or something?
24,127,Hilaria,"I think that it'll be very useful. I have not used it to transcribe new data, and this is the reason why at the retreat we're going to find out how can we, who are not technologically savvy people, start using and training these models with new data."
24,128,Gretchen,"So at the retreat the goal is to bring together the automatic speech recognition people and the minority language documentation people and say, 'Okay. How can we help each other? How can we make these tools that'll work for everything?'"
24,129,Hilaria,"How can we collaborate? How can we make tools for language documentation? Yes. Because on the one hand, we linguists are not -- we don't know how to operate these models, and the engineers, they know how to work these systems. So the two of us are going to come together, and we're going to have an honest conversation. We linguists will say, 'How would you like us to prepare our data so you can use it for your models?' They will tell us and vice versa, 'This is what we need.'"
24,130,Gretchen,"And you have people working on multiple different languages, and multiple different technology-type things, all together?"
24,131,Hilaria,"Yeah, that's right. In my conversations with Oliver Adams, right now our tools for major languages are very advanced. A lot of the problems have been solved. Actually, there are many sub-specialties within that field. For example, one of the interests that Oliver Adams has is multilingualism in ASR. So for him, this is so interesting because we're going to have different speakers. We're going to have speakers of Chatino languages, speakers of Mayan languages. Basically, what Oliver Adam says is that many of the differences sometimes could even be anatomical. He should explain what he means more, but..."
24,132,Gretchen,"So for multilingual automatic speech recognition, is that an automatic speech recognition tool that works for multiple languages at the same time?"
24,133,Hilaria,"Yeah, I think so."
24,134,Gretchen,"So if you're speaking in Chatino one minute and Spanish another minute, and let's say you also happen to speak a Mayan language, you could speak to it in any of those languages and it would be able to pick up, correctly, whatever you were doing?"
24,135,Hilaria,"You know, I'm really new in this field, so I really cannot speak --"
24,136,Gretchen,"This is the hope, maybe."
24,137,Hilaria,"Yeah, yeah. I think we need to ask the ASR people these particular questions."
24,138,Gretchen,Yeah. But it would be great if it would work for multiple languages. That would be really cool.
24,139,Hilaria,"Yes, yes. Actually, this is the new frontier."
24,140,Gretchen,"Yeah, that's right. Because there's six, seven thousand languages in the world, and there's what, maybe ten that you have really good automatic speech recognition tools for right now?"
24,141,Hilaria,"That's right, yes. Yes. But the thing is that, still, for minority languages, there are certain requirements that need to be there in place first. Like with Chatino, it was easy to do this because I have prepared the corpus. There is an alphabet we have for Chatino. So we have research in Chatino now, but many of those languages do not have this research available. So even if you have a sound file that is not transcribed in one language, it will not be useful for someone to --"
24,142,Gretchen,Because you do need some training data.
24,143,Hilaria,"Yeah, you do need training data, and also, you need a person to evaluate the output of the model."
24,144,Gretchen,Right. Because then you can't fix it if it's...
24,145,Hilaria,"That's right. For example, in the way we work with Oliver, it was that he put this data in, and then I as a person, as a speaker, I went out and just evaluated the output of the system. It has to be reciprocal."
24,146,Gretchen,"And so what's -- in 20 years when this is amazing and everything works great, what's the vision for how this works? Is it so people who speak Chatino can say, 'Okay, Google,' to their phones in Chatino and it will reply back?"
24,147,Hilaria,"Well, I mean, people can give it many uses, right? I don't know if I can say what kind of uses people can give it if we were able to get to that point. But on a personal level, I would love to be able to have a tool that could help me transcribe text that I have. Because, actually, we have hundreds of hours of recordings of Chatino text, and it'll be wonderful to be able to have these transcriptions. And the results of these transcriptions could be fed into ongoing dictionaries to study the syntax of the language, to study morphology, or all the different aspects of the grammar."
24,148,Gretchen,Or to make books or these kinds of things in the language.
24,149,Hilaria,"Or to make books in the language. For example, we have recorded many stories that -- they're sitting there. We haven't been able to transcribe them. It would be nice if we had a nice transcription with the story, so then we can work with our artists and make children's books, and develop all of these materials to promote the language."
24,150,Gretchen,"Yeah. Because you've made some books already, right?"
24,151,Hilaria,"That is right! We just had some books published with the help of many people. And I'm just so proud of this because this is one of the first times that I have seen children's books in Chatino. They are so beautiful, colorful."
24,152,Gretchen,They're really beautiful. You were showing them to me earlier and they're really lovely.
24,153,Hilaria,"This is a project that I did with my students in our language revitalization class that I taught in the winter 2018 at Dartmouth College. So one of the first things that we did was to do the drawings on cloth books. Each student developed their own theme, and they put it on cloth books. Then we had an exhibition, and then the exhibition was a success. It was really beautiful. People loved it."
24,154,Gretchen,"The cloth books look so cool! They're soft and you can -- you know, a baby couldn't destroy them."
24,155,Hilaria,That's right. And then I got some funding from the Neukom Foundation to do the publication in a different format of these books. One of the students had to draw pictures for many of the books because the originals were just images that students pulled out --
24,156,Gretchen,From the internet somewhere.
24,157,Hilaria,"-- from the internet somewhere, because we were not thinking forward about publications and things like that. But when we realised that we needed to publish them, and that Neukom was offering some funding to publish them, we realised that we did not want to get --"
24,158,Gretchen,You didn't want to get sued.
24,159,Hilaria,"Yeah, sued! So now we have these new books with completely new images, and they are --"
24,160,Gretchen,"And they're lovely. And they're Creative Commons, and they're Open License."
24,161,Hilaria,That's right.
24,162,Gretchen,So you had a few of those books be translated into other languages that don't have enough children's books?
24,163,Hilaria,"That's right. Because I had native speakers of North American languages in my class. I had my student who spoke Tlingit. There was another student who spoke Hupa, and Ojibwe. And when they saw this, they realised that they wanted to do the same version in their own languages."
24,164,Gretchen,That's so cool.
24,165,Hilaria,It was just really amazing. So all of these books just came out.
24,166,Gretchen,"So now there's this little link between the Tlingit speakers, and the Hupa speakers, and the Ojibwe speakers, and the Chatino speakers. They'll all have the same pictures in their books with the words in their own language."
24,167,Hilaria,"It is just so amazing, you know? I went back to Mexico, and I took the cloth books down to Oaxaca, and there was this friend from my community who came to visit. I was visiting my mom in Oaxaca. He came to visit. And then I sat down with him, and I read him one of the children's books. And then at the end he says to me, 'It is so sad,' he says, 'that our language is getting lost.' That is -- so really, the books really bring these conversations about the importance of language."
24,168,Gretchen,"And if the kids are -- because, probably, a lot of the kids still kind of speak the language at home, but then when they go to school and the only language they see written down is Spanish, whereas if they could see also written versions of Chatino so they could be bilingual, and know that there's people who care about the language, and give it more prestige, and these kinds of things."
24,169,Hilaria,"That is right. I grew up in Mexico hearing that indigenous languages were not languages because they did not have a writing system. That is why I wanted to develop an alphabet to show that this is a legitimate language. By having these cute little books, it's --"
24,170,Gretchen,"And they look very professional, too. Like, they're shiny. And they look very professional."
24,171,Hilaria,"That's right. Yeah. We wanted to make Chatino look good. So in this conversation that I had with this person from my community, I said to him, 'One of the worries that I have,' I said, 'if I distribute this book in the community, is that many of the books that I see, like textbooks that the schools give for free, they all end up in the toilet.' So then I said, 'One of the worries that I have is that my book will end up in the toilet.'"
24,172,Gretchen,Yeah.
24,173,Hilaria,"He said to me very seriously, 'You know what? I'm going to tell you one thing.' He says, 'I read the Bible. I do not take the Bible in the toilet. The Bible in my house has a special place. This book will be next to the Bible.'"
24,174,Gretchen,What a compliment!
24,175,Hilaria,Yeah.
24,176,Gretchen,That is so meaningful.
24,177,Hilaria,"It was just really beautiful, yes."
24,178,Gretchen,Yeah.
24,179,Hilaria,"So I want to use these books to promote the language. One of the things that I would like to do, since this is a personal endeavour, and I don't have the backing of the state, I don't have unlimited resources."
24,180,Gretchen,Yeah.
24,181,Hilaria,"I would like to enlist families in the community to read the books, and then take videos of them interacting with the books and reading them with their children, take videos, and then, with their permission, upload them on social media, and in this way promote reading."
24,182,Gretchen,"And they can see it. Because I think this is the thing is the technology space seems like it's so dominated by just a few languages, and to say, okay, this can be a language of technology, and this can be a language of writing and of the future that you can keep passing on to your kids."
24,183,Hilaria,That is right. Yeah.
24,184,Gretchen,Yeah.
24,185,Hilaria,"I sometimes put little videos saying little phrases in Chatino. There are a lot of Chatinos who have migrated to the States. And they have children, and some of them are teaching Chatino to their children. Apparently I have some toddlers that follow my little videos."
24,186,Gretchen,Oh my gosh!
24,187,Hilaria,"They just watch it over and over, and they repeat the words."
24,188,Gretchen,"Oh my god, you're like their teacher, or their grandma."
24,189,Hilaria,Yes. But I wish I could do more. It's just very sporadic.
24,190,Gretchen,"Yeah. But that's still so cool. So if you can get other people making videos as well, maybe that helps."
24,191,Hilaria,"Yes. Yeah, just make these books in different forms, like make little --"
24,192,Gretchen,Or digital versions of them or something.
24,193,Hilaria,"-- animation, or things like that, yeah."
24,194,Gretchen,"Yeah, that's very cool. I've taken a photo of the books already. So we will share a photo of the books, and we'll also link to whatever website or something you have set up for those. People can go see them, and you can see what they look like."
24,195,Hilaria,"And you know what? One of the most important things about this is that this -- as you say, these books have a Creative Commons License. So if someone out there would like to create children's books, they can use the same images, and just put their own text, and use the same things to publish their own books for their own language."
24,196,Gretchen,"Yeah, that's really great. Hopefully you'll get photos being sent in from around the world of people doing that."
24,197,Hilaria,That would be amazing.
24,198,Gretchen,That would be amazing. Send Hilaria your photos if you end up using them. [Music]

24,200,Hilaria,Stay Lingthusiastic! [Music]
25,1,Lauren,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics. I'm Lauren Gawne."
25,2,Gretchen,"And I'm Gretchen McCulloch, and today we're getting enthusiastic about how every word is a real word. But first, it's almost our second anniversary! Whoa!"
25,3,Lauren,"Yay! Next month is our anniversary month. We like celebrating in November. It will be episode number 26. We can do maths, don't worry. It's not episode 24 because we launched with several episodes at once, but we are very excited about our anniversary month."
25,4,Gretchen,"Yes! And on our first anniversary, we celebrated by asking you to help more people find the show, and you definitely came through. We ended up thanking almost 100 people in our anniversary post for all your recommendations on social media. And we saw a big bump in listeners, which kept going afterwards and even until now. And so, this year we want to see if we can thank 200 of you for recommending Lingthusiasm to people in your lives."
25,5,Lauren,"That means we need your help. So if you know anyone who could use a little bit more language nerdery in their lives, this is the month to share the show on social media. Email people, text them, send it to your group chat, or just leave a well-placed sticky note for the person in the office. Writing a review or even just leaving a rating on whatever podcast app you use really helps us so much. It helps other people find the show, and it helps encourage other people to click Play if they happen to come across us."
25,6,Gretchen,"And it helps your friends who need more interesting things to listen to, who want more fun linguistics in their lives. It helps them find something that they're going to enjoy. If you send us your reviews or tag us in your post on social media, we would love to see them, and we'll be thanking everybody that we know about in our anniversary blog post on lingthusiasm.com. We'll pick a couple reviews to feature there."
25,7,Lauren,"If you would prefer to recommend us privately, please send us an email with the story of how you recommended us so that we can add you to the thank you post."
25,8,Gretchen,"Or feel free to just recommend us and not tell us about it. You can still get the warm, fuzzy feeling. Plus you'll get to feel a warm, fuzzy glow of satisfaction both when you recommend us and when we thank you all together at the end. Even if you don't tell us about it, you can still feel that warm fuzzy feeling."
25,9,Lauren,"Lingthusiasm is an independent show, but we are lucky to have a massive marketing department, which is all of you."
25,10,Gretchen,Aww!
25,11,Lauren,And we really appreciate when you take the opportunity to share Lingthusiasm with other people.
25,12,Gretchen,"If everybody introduced the show to just one new listener, our audience would double."
25,13,Lauren,"So this month, take the chance to recommend us or review us."
25,14,Gretchen,"We really appreciate it, and so do the people who are about to discover the show because of you. We also have another way to discover the show, which is two live shows! In addition to the Melbourne live show, which is going to be on the 16th of November, we also added a show in Sydney on the 12th of November, so you can go to either of those shows. Just go to Lingthusiasm.com, look for the link that says Live Show to get tickets."
25,15,Lauren,"We're really excited to be joined by Tiger Webb in Sydney, who is the ABC's language researcher. Super excited to also be joined by Alice Gaby for our Melbourne show, who's a researcher at Monash. And we're also thrilled that we will have both shows fully Auslan-interpreted as well."
25,16,Gretchen,"Yeah, so the topic of those shows is how the internet is making English better. We're going to be talking about a few bits that are coming out from my book and from other things on the internet, and through texting, and emoji, and everything. There's no knowledge of linguistics or of previous Lingthusiasm episodes assumed, so feel free to bring your friends even if they have never listened to an episode, because then they'll have this whole back catalogue to discover. We're really looking forward to seeing you there and meeting people in real life after the show!"
25,17,Lauren,"Other quick exciting news, we have new merchandise, including adorable space babies, t-shirts that say, 'I want to be the English schwa. It's never stressed.' We also have baby clothes that say, 'Not judging your grammar, just acquiring it,' as well as new IPA scarf colours and now, IPA ties."
25,18,Gretchen,"So you can get the International Phonetic Alphabet on various items as well as the clever baby riff on 'not judging a grammar, just analysing it.' The baby is just acquiring it; I love this one so much. The space babies are so cute. Everything's coming up babies in the merch these days --"
25,19,Lauren,Yeah.
25,20,Gretchen,"-- including this month's bonus topic, which is about multilingual babies and raising kids speaking multiple languages. For this and 19 other bonus episodes -- there are so many bonus episodes now! It's like twice as much Lingthusiasm. You can go to patreon.com/lingthusiasm and support the show and listen to all the bonus episodes."
25,21,Lauren,"And while everything's coming up babies, probably about time I let everyone know I'm going to be having a baby in January."
25,22,Gretchen,What? What a coincidence! It actually really is a coincidence.
25,23,Lauren,"That's actually quite the coincidence that -- it's just baby month here at Lingthusiasm. We are definitely going to keep running all the way through December, January, February, and beyond, so no worries about that. We'll still have our main episode every month as well as your Patreon bonus episode."
25,24,Gretchen,"Yeah, so we'll be recording episodes, and events, and interviews, and so on in advance to make sure that we give Lauren some mat leave from the show and make sure that everyone here still gets to listen to it. And I'm very excited to hear the results of your new, long-term longitudinal language acquisition project! [Music]"
25,25,Gretchen,"Have you ever heard, Lauren, someone say, 'That's not a real word'?"
25,26,Lauren,"Oh my gosh, like, so often."
25,27,Gretchen,All the time.
25,28,Lauren,"It's just a go-to phrase that people throw around a lot. But when we started talking about this idea of what is a real word and what is not, it seems like such a simple throwaway line. But there's so many things that are happening when people say this."
25,29,Gretchen,"Yeah, there's a whole bunch of different things that someone can mean when they say, 'Oh, well, such-and-such, that's not a real word,' and it seems like breaking those down individually can help us understand what's really going on here and why -- Spoiler Alert -- all words are real words. We're going to come back to that. We'll keep coming back to that."
25,30,Lauren,We'll keep coming back to this very important point.
25,31,Gretchen,"I don't like to do the fake Myth Bust-y thing where it's like, 'It's an open question: Are there some words that aren't real?' Like, no."
25,32,Lauren,"Absolutely not, spoiler alert."
25,33,Gretchen,I'm going to start with the answer and then we get to break it down and not leave you hanging.
25,34,Lauren,"Yeah, so there's not going to be any 'Surprise, everything is a real word' at the end of this. We're very happy to state that as a starting point."
25,35,Gretchen,"'Are some words unreal?' I think it's one of those questions that's like -- that's like saying, 'Are some animals not animals?' Well, you're already calling them animals, like, what are you doing with yourself?"
25,36,Lauren,Yeah.
25,37,Gretchen,Are some words not words? No!
25,38,Lauren,"The thing I find really interesting about the different subcategories of 'It's not a word' is it shows how we conceptualise words and how our brain processes different things in different ways. And how language is both this thing that happens in our brains but also in our particular social contexts and interactions. That's why in this episode, we're going to look at all the different things that people really mean when they say, 'That's not a real word'. Shall we take a tour, Gretchen?"
25,39,Gretchen,"Okay, let's take a tour."
25,40,Lauren,We've given them very serious scientific category names because everything sounds so much better when you give them a very official name.
25,41,Gretchen,"Yeah, the first kind of thing people mean sometimes is the 'blobfish.'"
25,42,Lauren,The Blobfish Reaction.
25,43,Gretchen,"The Blobfish Reaction. So if I'm like, 'Oh, yes, here's a blobfish...'"
25,44,Lauren,"What the heck is a blob -- 'blobfish' isn't a real word, Gretchen. You just made that up. You're not even sounding science-y by saying this is a blobfish. You're just looking at something that looks hideous and calling it a blobfish. That's not a real word."
25,45,Gretchen,"It's a cartoon thing. Blobfish are apparently real animals. I googled 'strange animals' to try to come up with the best example of a strange animal, and the blobfish one -- hands down, it is really weird and blob-y looking. You should definitely look it up. But more to the point, apparently blobfish exist. Apparently the scientific community probably also has a Latin name for them but definitely also calls them blobfish. This is something that, if you hadn't heard of it, like me half an hour ago, or like Lauren until two minutes ago, you're like, 'That sounds fake.'"
25,46,Lauren,"I just looked it up on Wikipedia, and they are apparently a fish from Australia. So now I'm feeling very -- like I've failed as an Australian."
25,47,Gretchen,Oh no. But they don't have a name like 'blubbo' or something?
25,48,Lauren,"No, we haven't called them 'blobbies' yet."
25,49,Gretchen,"Ah, I think that's just a failure of imagination. But yeah, so sometimes your reaction is that's not a real word because: I don't think that's a real thing; I don't even know if that's a thing; or I haven't heard this word before."
25,50,Lauren,I felt really embarrassed because I was probably about 26 or 27 the first time I heard the word 'isthmus.'
25,51,Gretchen,"Oh, okay."
25,52,Lauren,"And I just did not have it -- it turns out, we just don't have isthmuses in Australia. It's like a peninsula- type thing."
25,53,Gretchen,"Yeah, it's kind of -- I don't know what the difference is between isthmus and a peninsula now that I'm thinking about it. I'm sure someone does but off the top of my head --"
25,54,Lauren,The difference is that I had heard of the word 'peninsula' before I was 27.
25,55,Gretchen,"I mean, I grew up on a peninsula, but I don't know -- and there are, definitely, also some places called isthmuses -- isthmae? Isthmapodes? What is the plural of an isthmus? I can't even say this word anymore. It's too difficult."
25,56,Lauren,"Yeah, trying to have the first reaction of it -- instead of being 'That's not a word,' trying to have the first reaction of, 'That is not a word I have encountered yet.'"
25,57,Gretchen,"Yes, I haven't heard of that. And how sad the world would be if I knew all the words already. Can you imagine not learning any new words? You'd never have that like, 'Whoa, what is that' or 'I learned a new thing now.' Imagine a world where you've learned all the words. That's a terrible world!"
25,58,Lauren,Imagine a world where the vocabulary was so finite that you'd run out of new words and experiences to have.
25,59,Gretchen,"Oh, what a horrible word -- world. You know, I'm trying to think of examples of this, because I have definitely heard of words far too late and been like, 'Whoa, that's a real thing? Okay!'"
25,60,Lauren,But also think of how quickly your brain managed to absorb them and accept them. I now very happily accept that 'isthmus' is a real word and the isthmus of Oaxaca is a real place because my brain is capable of accepting new words.
25,61,Gretchen,"And that blobfish are real animals apparently. I saw a graph once that said the average adult between the age of like, I don't know, 18 and 55 or something, learns one new word on average every day. We're still learning new words all the way through adulthood even though we think of learning new words as something you do when you're a kid, or when you're in school, or when you're acquiring a specific technical area, and yet we're picking up new words all the time."
25,62,Lauren,We're perfectly capable of it. So the important lesson here is that we don't know all the words.
25,63,Gretchen,"Erin McKean has a really nice quote about this from her TED talk about redefining the dictionary. She says when people think about a place and they don't find that place on a map, they think there's a problem with the map. But when they find a word that's not in the dictionary, they think this must be a bad word. But it's more likely to be a bad dictionary. And I think that really sums it up. Okay, maybe a word is or isn't in a dictionary, but you've still found it in the dictionary, that is something that's just made by people, and they still have to acquire all the words themselves."
25,64,Lauren,"That's funny how we go, 'I don't believe you that 'blobfish' is a real word,' but it's not like I'm going to sit here and go, 'I don't believe you that Carlton is a real place.'"
25,65,Gretchen,"Yeah, exactly!"
25,66,Lauren,And I'm going to take you to Carlton when you're here because there's great ice cream.
25,67,Gretchen,"Okay, good. Yeah, like, 'Oh, Lauren, I haven't been to Carlton. I didn't know there was --' actually, there's a Carlton in Canada as well, because the Brits and colonies and stuff. It's the name of a University in Ottawa. So I've been to that Carlton. I'm like, 'That's a real place.' But my Carlton is not the same as your Carlton."
25,68,Lauren,"Well, that is probably true in this case."
25,69,Gretchen,"I think there's kind of a subset of this category which is using an existing word in a different sort of way. One of the things that I did for my very scientific research of this episode was I looked for the quote 'isn't a real word' and 'not a real word' to see what kinds of words people were saying were to be a word. So this is how we came up with these different categories as we took what people were saying about something not being real words and we kind of broke them down into the different types of things people do. And a couple that we came across people saying weren't real words were things like 'learnings,' which is, I guess, used in teacher jargon to mean: the learnings; the learning outcomes; or the learnings that the students will derive from this lesson are blah blah blah. I haven't heard 'learnings' being used in that particular context, but I definitely believe that people could do it. And the annoyance that I was seeing with someone calling that 'not a real word' was more about being annoyed with jargon, or being annoyed at using an existing word in a different sort of way that the other person wanted to be like, 'No, that's not legitimate. I don't want to acknowledge that one.'"
25,70,Lauren,"And again, it's this 'I have never come across this before so it must be wrong' not 'I just haven't had my brain expanded for this new category.'"
25,71,Gretchen,"Maybe there are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than have been dreamt of in your philosophy, or your learnings as it will."
25,72,Lauren,"It's also very likely -- you could almost reliably put money on this, but especially the ones that people keep coming back to, like 'impact' as a noun is one that people complain about a lot. And, like, there's over years of records of people using that word in that way. Generally, these ones become recurrent cycles of outrage when there's no good evidence that other people haven't been happily using it this way for a very long time."
25,73,Gretchen,"Yeah, either it's been used that way for a long time or it hasn't been, but we could start doing it now. It's fine. People seem to pass along their annoyance with corporations, or with their boss, or with stuff of being kind of new to you and therefore opaque or difficult to understand, with the annoyance of the words themselves, when they're just -- you know, the words are innocent here. They're just channelling your feelings towards the boss or the -- you know, there's a lot of corporate jargon going on, or something like that. Saying 'learnings' -- if people are using it as a word; It's a word now. And 'impact' has been a useful verb and noun for many hundreds of years."
25,74,Lauren,"The next type of 'that's not a word' reaction you find is an extension of that form that we just talked about, which is what we're calling the Funner Reaction."
25,75,Gretchen,"When I came across this one, I specifically saw a lot of people using words like 'funner' and 'funnest' and self-consciously saying of themselves like, 'This game is funner than the other one. I know that's not a word.' So rather than using it as a criticism of someone else, like I noticed with the other kind of examples, people were using it as kind of a pre-emptive self-criticism, like, 'Yeah, I know this isn't a word. Don't make fun of me for this, but it's something that I want to use right now.' And I think that's slightly different."
25,76,Lauren,"It's something you want to use, and it makes complete sense. So it's something like 'impact' as a noun is completely codified in English. There's lots of examples. Things like 'funner' or 'necessariness' or 'squishable' are all words that might not be in a dictionary, but we know what each of the individual parts of that are. We have English morphology that's sufficiently consistent and transparent that we understand what all of those bits are doing when we combine them, even if they're not codified normally to go that way."
25,77,Gretchen,"Yeah, you can add '-able' to a whole bunch of words. You can say 'squishable,' or 'huggable...'"
25,78,Lauren,'Doughnutable.'
25,79,Gretchen,"'Laughable,' 'doughnutable.' I think a lot more things should be 'doughnutable' or 'ice-cream-able.'"
25,80,Lauren,Yeah.
25,81,Gretchen,"Are the same types of things doughnutable that are ice-cream-able? Like, this is great! It's really cool that language can do this, and it's a shame to see people limiting themselves from this. Well, kind of not limiting themselves, but then adding this pre-emptive fig leaf because we're so used to limiting ourselves by not doing this type of linguistic play. It's there to be played with. Let's play with it."
25,82,Lauren,"Especially if you are -- it's interesting that people feel they have to police themselves on social media, which is a more playful and informal -- maybe don't start using non-standard combinations of bits of words in, like, a job application or your Nobel Prize speech. Maybe stick with some more standard forms there. But if you can't play around with language on social media, it's a bit sad."
25,83,Gretchen,"Yeah, well, and I think the question is not so much where is making up words or where is playing around with words appropriate, but where is play appropriate. You know, certain types of environments like a formal dinner or something aren't necessarily appropriate for playing with your food or playing with your words, but that doesn't mean that other environments aren't appropriate for this. You know, there is a space for play."
25,84,Lauren,Look! I've made my soup doughnutable!
25,85,Gretchen,"Maybe don't do this if you're having dinner with the Queen. Maybe don't. But that's a feature of a particular social situation, a broader social context, and I think we have the sense that language should be more rigid than even other areas where -- you know, an experimental chef is admirable. Or if you're good at experimenting in the kitchen, that's a good thing you can do. And yet, people feel the need to apologise for experimenting with their vocabulary. Don't apologise! This is great. This is a feature, it's not a bug."
25,86,Lauren,I feel like there are some really expensive restaurants where you pay a lot of money to have ice-cream-ised to soup.
25,87,Gretchen,"Oh no. It's worth experimenting with this. Some of them are almost so well used that they've taken on status of their own. A lot of people will observe, you know, you can be 'overwhelmed,' you can be 'underwhelmed,' but can you be just 'whelmed'? Or why can't you be just 'whelmed'? Some of these have been around for a while."
25,88,Lauren,"Poor whelmed. It got abandoned by its cool, more morphologically complex children."
25,89,Gretchen,"Yeah, its children abandoned it. But yeah, let's play with these things."
25,90,Lauren,"So 'whelmed' was a word. It was a completely normal word, and we added 'under-' and 'over-' and then we forgot about 'whelmed.' And now people say 'whelmed' isn't a real word. Poor whelmed."
25,91,Gretchen,"It was real for a while. Why can't it come back? But I think it's a matter of perception. If people start using 'whelmed' again, people will figure out what it means."
25,92,Lauren,Like a horse getting into a unicorn costume and it no longer exists.
25,93,Gretchen,"I think another reaction that I see from 'Okay, is this a word?' or 'Can this be a word?' is what I'd like to call the Schadenfreude Reaction, which is like, 'Well, the Germans have a word for this.'"
25,94,Gretchen,"We English speakers, we can't possibly, but the Germans must have a word for it. This one always -- it's a very particular kind of reaction because it's a sense of, 'It'd be great if we could create a word. It would be nice if this type of thing existed, but I can't possibly do that as an English speaker. We need to go to another language and let them do it,' which is a lot of what the history of English-speaking science and philosophy have done, is just go to Greek or Latin and make them create a word, and then borrow it into English, because somehow that seems more legitimate. These days, it's German. But it's the same sort of thing. And I think it's that we create words in English all the time and yet we have this sense of like, 'Oh, maybe someone shouldn't do that,' or those kinds of things. In particular, German is very good at creating words by compounding them."
25,95,Lauren,English is also good at creating words by compounding them.
25,96,Gretchen,Yeah!
25,97,Lauren,It's just that we still leave a space there.
25,98,Gretchen,"Yeah, I found someone saying that for some reason they thought 'apple lovers' wasn't a real word. And I was very confused about this because surely all English speakers recognise 'apple' and surely all English speakers recognise 'lovers.' So I guess they're asserting that 'apple lovers' together isn't a real word. But you just made it. Congratulations! Now it's real."
25,99,Lauren,"But it's got a space there, Gretchen, and I'm very anxious about the fact that a word is a thing that has a space on either side of it."
25,100,Gretchen,"Well, maybe this is the point of the podcast where we have to say: For all that we're saying all words are real, there's another linguistic sense in which a word isn't even a linguistically meaningful unit because where you put your spaces is a certain kind of arbitrary."
25,101,Lauren,It's as much a product of the history of our writing system as it is anything else.
25,102,Gretchen,"Yeah, and the same thing that gives German a word like 'schadenfreude,' which is literally just 'schaden,' which means harm or damage, and 'freude,' which means like happiness or joy, and they're like, 'Oh, harm-joy.' English could do this too. English does the same sort of thing by smushing together multiple words. There's just -- we're more likely to leave a space there and less likely to shove them together. If you wanted to say 'apple lover' in German, you could definitely do that. It'd probably be something like 'Apfellieber.' But you just wouldn't put a space there."
25,103,Lauren,"Oh, that's right! We should use that in English."
25,104,Gretchen,But we could just say 'apple lover'!
25,105,Lauren,So we could accept that having a space in the middle of something doesn't prevent it from being a word.
25,106,Gretchen,"Yeah, and there's lots of -- you know, dictionaries are really good at adding compound words even if they have a space in between them. It's just they seem like two words for the purposes of -- if you're doing word count on your Word document, to be like, 'How many words is in here,' it will count them separately because they have spaces. But a lot of things like 'greenhouse,' or 'chalkboard...'"
25,107,Lauren,Smartphone...
25,108,Gretchen,"Smartphone... You know, those started out with a space in between them and then we gradually got rid of the space. German just goes a little bit faster than us in getting rid of the space."
25,109,Lauren,"There's also one that I'm sure you have an example from when you were, perhaps, growing up or when you move to a different dialect area, where someone essentially tries to shame you for using a form that isn't part of standard English or is less-used in standard English. We've called this the Ain't Reaction."
25,110,Gretchen,"I think 'ain't' is the quintessential example of this, because it's so present in so many varieties of English, and it's so shamed in all of them where it's present, and yet it's still there, and it's still alive and kicking in English. People write letters to the editor about finding it in dictionaries like, 'Aaaargh, this shouldn't be there and it's because it's not real,' and there's so much animus towards 'ain't.'"
25,111,Lauren,How many decades and centuries of people telling other people 'This isn't a real word' has it been and 'ain't' is still going strong? It just makes me so happy.
25,112,Gretchen,"Yeah, good job 'ain't,' you're a fighter. Well, it starts out as a contraction of 'amn't,' like 'am not.' 'Is' goes to 'isn't,' but what does 'am' go to?"
25,113,Lauren,Amn't!
25,114,Gretchen,"'It isn't,' but 'I amn't.' That eventually turns into 'ain't.' That's why there's no 'amn't' now. Except I think there is in a couple dialects, but not in most dialects. So 'ain't' takes on that function, but then once it stops sounding directly like 'amn't,' it's like, 'Well, I could just expand and work for all of the different pronouns!' It's very versatile. It's super useful. And yet it's highly, highly stigmatised. The way that that stigmatisation is expressed is, specifically, in this 'not a real word.'"
25,115,Lauren,"I think it speaks to the fact that 'not a real word' gets used as this really broad, un-reflexive, unconsidered response to this thing that clearly is a word people use all the time and that the only reaction you have is 'That's not a real word' instead of 'That is a word that is considered informal and is probably best not used on this tombstone.'"
25,116,Gretchen,"I'm sure someone's used it on a tombstone. Yeah, I think there's a lot of nuance in that. And this is one of the examples where 'That's not a real word' gets used to shut down discussion and shut down argumentation, especially like, 'Oh, that's not a real word.' 'Well, I looked it up. It's in the dictionary.' And then you're like, 'Well, that's a bad dictionary now because it had this not-real-word in it.' It's one of those things, like, you can't have an argument with somebody who won't at least acknowledge what would have to exist in order for them to be proven wrong."
25,117,Lauren,Yeah.
25,118,Gretchen,"You know, if you say, 'Well, would you accept that dictionary as a source'? And then you show them the word in Merriam-Webster or Oxford -- all the dictionaries have 'ain't' -- and then you show them there, and they're like, 'Well, I don't accept this as a source either.' You're like, 'Well, you just changed the goalposts now.' Who do you accept as the ultimate arbiter for what is or isn't a word? Or is anyone who makes the assertion something isn't a word automatically the correct one?"
25,119,Lauren,"I just feel like if someone says to you, 'That's not a word,' it's really unfair that the burden of proof falls on you."
25,120,Gretchen,"But I'm like, 'Here's a store that's there.' And you're like, 'Nope. Not a real store because it's not in the yellow pages yet.' I'm like, 'But you can walk into it. It's a store that will sell you things.' They're like, 'Nope.' No one's ever asked, 'Oh, not a real word? Well, define a real word. What is a real word?'"
25,121,Lauren,"I guess the challenge here is -- the easy response is to say, 'Well, here's evidence that it is.' But often when people are saying this, there is something here that's about language policing, and it's often cover for some kind of classism, or racism, or it's particularly picking on the language of a particular subgroup, or it's covert sexism. So there is something here that's unpleasant, and I wish people would stop doing."
25,122,Gretchen,"But even when I agree with them, it's also still an argument made in bad faith."
25,123,Lauren,Yeah.
25,124,Gretchen,"You know, it's not -- if someone says, 'Well, you know, this isn't a word,' even if I agree that this was probably a typo that someone made, or this is something that maybe wasn't appropriate to a particular context, legitimising the argument that 'not a real word' is a reasonable response to anything is still a problem, even if the core thing that they're getting at might have some utility in the context because it's so undefined, and it's such an easy way of covering for classism and racism and all sorts of these kinds of discriminations that people smuggle into language."
25,125,Lauren,Yeah.
25,126,Gretchen,"The problem is the incorrect ideas about how language works, not the particular words being used. Another type of word that people have the reaction 'It's not a word' to is a word like 'smush' or 'smoosh' or 'aaaargh.'"
25,127,Lauren,"So things that are more representative of sounds, or reactions, or feelings that are often informal, or onomatopoeia."
25,128,Gretchen,"Yeah, and I think this begins to get into like, 'Oh, it's not a word because my computer gave me a red underline when I tried to type it.' There are lots of different ways to try to spell 'aaaargh,' and I definitely don't think computers, generally, have all of them. That doesn't mean that a particular one isn't going to be the exact one you want right now but, thinking about those areas, we're trying to represent certain moods, or certain feelings, or certain onomatopoeias, or certain other kinds of sounds that exist in nature or in the depths of our soul, like 'aaaah.' These are hard to write adequately."
25,129,Lauren,"And a lot of onomatopoeia in English is a bit not-standardised, and people kind of play with it a lot. In other languages, it can be more codified into the language. If you think about onomatopoeia in terms of the sounds that animals make, we have lots of codified ways of doing that. You know, pigs 'oink' and ducks 'quack,' and that's very codified. You'll find 'quack' in the dictionary. And you'll probably find 'oink' in the dictionary. But, essentially, language is very messy at the boundaries in the way that what is a word and isn't a word -- and you can't just be like, 'Well, it's got a space.' That gets a bit fuzzy at the boundaries. The same with this. So like 'smush' might be more of a word than 'aaaah,' which is perhaps all that easy to say. And, you know, 'haha' is more of a word than [laughing noise] in terms of laughter."
25,130,Gretchen,"Yeah, but there's a certain kind of intentionality to them too, which I think distinguishes even something like 'aaaargh,' which can be spelled in a whole bunch of different ways, from something just kind of randomly mashing on your keyboard, or having your cat walk across your keyboard --"
25,131,Lauren,"Or actually screaming, which we won't do for the sake of your ears."
25,132,Gretchen,"Yeah, no screaming on this podcast. If you'd like to scream, please provide your own scream here. But there's a certain conventionalised way of representing those, and they have a certain recognisability to them and language-specific way of doing them, even if there's also this flexibility around them as well."
25,133,Lauren,"At the opposite end, moving back to things that do fit within our expectation that they only have spaces on either side, they usually have relatively regularised spelling conventions, but people get very upset about them, is when brands make forays into word creation."
25,134,Gretchen,Oh dear.
25,135,Lauren,"And because -- I think one thing that upsets people about this a lot is -- when it doesn't feel forced, we don't think about it. And we accept a squillion brand names into our lives, and they just get absorbed, and we're completely fine with it. And then there are times where it just feels very forced, and so..."
25,136,Gretchen,It crashes.
25,137,Lauren,I have named this the Tronc Reaction when people say 'That's not a word.' So 'Tronc' was the Tribune Publishing Company. Quite a few years ago they rebranded themselves to Tronc: T-R-O-N-C.
25,138,Gretchen,"Yeah, which was just -- they got kind of widely made fun of for it on social media as just like, 'Why have you picked this name? It's so ugly. It's plunky. It's tronc-y. It's not a good name.'"
25,139,Lauren,"And there is something about -- you know, it doesn't have a particularly standardised English spelling -- it's T-R-O-N-C -- but it definitely fits. It's not like it's against the kind of sounds that you can put together in English."
25,140,Gretchen,"Yeah, and it definitely sounds a bit, I don't know, like, plunky. It's a bit clumsy-sounding. But we've incorporated so many weird words into English, things like Xerox or Kleenex, which have a lot more X's than a normal English word does, or something like Google or Twitter, which sounded very frivolous when they were first introduced, and now we're just like, 'Oh, yeah, of course, I'm going to google it.' And it doesn't seem weird to us because we're so used to them."
25,141,Lauren,"And I think it's partly that we're very happy to accommodate new words when we need them. So Google sounded pretty silly when it started, and now we talk about googling things to the point where, if I'm trying to find something in a document, I'll sometimes be like, 'Oh, I just have to google for that word.' It's like, I'm not even in the proprietary search engine. It's just become the handy word. So if the language needs that word -- whereas I don't talk about 'Bing-ing' anything."
25,142,Gretchen,"But, yeah, like, 'I'm going to go Yahoo it.'"
25,143,Lauren,I don't have any particularly strong feelings about either of these search engines.
25,144,Gretchen,But one of them is definitely a lot more verb-y.
25,145,Lauren,One of them has definitely verbed into English a lot more happily.
25,146,Gretchen,I even use 'Skype' to indicate for general video calls even if I'm not actually using Skype's platform.
25,147,Lauren,"Oh yeah, it doesn't matter what platform I'm using, it's still -- that's become generic."
25,148,Gretchen,"It's like, 'Hey, Lauren, do you want to Skype?' And then of course it's gonna be on Google Hangouts or something. It's not gonna be on Skype."
25,149,Lauren,"Which is problematic for companies. You know, when their brand gets used generically, it means that they lose some of the brand copyright power. But I think it shows that language can be quite accommodating. I mean, English does love adding new words all the time. Whether they come from a top-down company or not seems to be a bit arbitrary. But it's the thing about when we need them."
25,150,Gretchen,Yeah.
25,151,Lauren,"You know, Skype came around as the first video platform that I use."
25,152,Gretchen,"It's when we need them or when -- it's something that people decide for themselves kind of bottom-up and not, I think, something forced down. Another one that I had a lot of fun with seeing people do on this was -- so somebody replied to the Pope's Twitter account, where the Pope was talking about the Beatitudes, which is -- it's a thing in the Bible, I don't know. Being like, ''Beatitudes' isn't a real word.' It's like, 'Look, guys. This is the Pope.'"
25,153,Lauren,"I probably can't tell you what a beatitude is off the top of my head but, frankly, if the Pope is talking about them, he probably thinks they're real a word."
25,154,Gretchen,"Yeah, yeah. Like, 'Is this really the hill you want to die on right now?' Like tweeting at the Pope being like, 'This obscure bit of theological terminology, which you have spent your entire life studying, is not a real word.' I also found somebody saying that 'gubernatorial' is not a real word? And I agree this word looks weird."
25,155,Lauren,I kind of almost feel compelled to agree. There is some story here where 'governor' and 'gubernatorial' came into English through slightly different -- There's always the French-from-Latin paths.
25,156,Gretchen,Okay.
25,157,Lauren,"And like, one of them came in via Latin via French, and one of them snuck in straight via French or something. And that's why 'gubernatorial' is -- it should just be 'governatorial' if we're going to have a regularised system. But English, like any language, can handle quite a bit of irregularity in the vocabulary."
25,158,Gretchen,"Yeah, and you get the impression people who are using arguments like this -- you know, they're not really saying to the Pope like, 'I don't trust your command of the English language,' especially the Pope's social media officer, who probably isn't even the actual Pope. What they're saying is, 'This is an argument that I can make that' -- like, we're talking about the beginning. You can use this as an argument even if you don't believe it, because it immediately shifts the burden of proof to the other person to say, 'No, this is a word and here's why,' and not to you for being like, 'Well, why don't you think so?'"
25,159,Lauren,"It kind of reminds me of a subset of this, which I like to think of as the Mansplain Reaction, which is where you say something's not a real word because it conflicts with your worldview, essentially."
25,160,Gretchen,"I really like an example of this that I found, which was somebody saying that 'conspiracy theory' is not a real word."
25,161,Lauren,"Oh, okay."
25,162,Gretchen,I know!
25,163,Lauren,"Why is 'conspiracy theory' not a real word? Is it because it has a space in it? Gretchen, we've been through this one."
25,164,Gretchen,"No, somebody said it's a made-up mind-control word that causes one to dismiss the facts of any investigation. I was like, 'Oh, okay.'"
25,165,Lauren,This is a pretty prototypical example of a Mansplain Reaction.
25,166,Gretchen,"Yeah, so it's like, 'I don't like the concept expressed by this word, so I'm going to attack the word not the concept,' or say like, 'It was unnecessary to name this concept because I don't think the concept is important or I don't think the concept exists.'"
25,167,Lauren,There's no such thing as 'mansplaining.' We're just having a conversation in which I am aggressively disagreeing at you.
25,168,Gretchen,"Right. I think the big problem that I have with the 'not a real word' argument is it implies that there are some sorts of words that aren't real. But by the time something exists for you to say, 'It's a kind of word,' that's all it takes to be a real word."
25,169,Lauren,"And words are words by consensus. No word is a real word. Every word has to start off by a group of people agreeing that this string of sounds has this particular meaning. And some people in some contexts have more authority in naming these things. You know, I will probably trust a doctor in telling me whether a word means a particular thing in terms of medical usage. I will definitely trust someone to tell me what their name is rather than trusting myself."
25,170,Gretchen,"Yeah, I think there are certain kinds of authorities. A person is the ultimate authority on what their own name is, and, by that logic, linguists should be the ultimate authorities on whether words are real or not. And what we're telling you is all the words are real. [Music]"

26,1,Gretchen,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics! I'm Gretchen McCulloch."
26,2,Lauren,"And I'm Lauren Gawne, and today, we're getting enthusiastic about palatalisation. That is to say, 'What the heck is going on with G and C?' But first, thanks to everyone for your enthusiastic recommending during our November Recommend-A-Thon."
26,3,Gretchen,"Yes, thanks so much for all your tweets, and posts, and shares, and all of the new people that you've brought in with you to listen to Lingthusiasm."
26,4,Lauren,"We will be thanking every one of you who made some kind of public declaration about their love of Lingthusiasm. We'll give you until the end of the month to add yourself to that esteemed group of people, so we can thank you all in our annual anniversary post."
26,5,Gretchen,"Yes, so you have till the end of November 2018 to be part of this year's Recommend-A-Thon thank you post, which will live in perpetuity on our website. Last year we thanked 100 people. This year, I think we can thank even more. I'm really excited by what we've seen so far."
26,6,Lauren,"I'm feeling very confident about that. And of course, you can continue to recommend us to anyone who needs a little more linguistics in their life any time of the year."
26,7,Gretchen,I also want to thank everybody who came out to the live shows.
26,8,Lauren,"Yay! I'm not gonna lie, we're recording this before the live shows."
26,9,Gretchen,So we're really hoping people actually come.
26,10,Lauren,We are just going to have to assume that they were an absolute rolling success.
26,11,Gretchen,"We're recording well in advance at the moment to make sure that we have episodes for when Lauren's on leave. We're very excited about those live shows. I assume they were great. Thanks so much to everyone who came out in Melbourne and Sydney. It was so fun to get to see those cities. We also want to remind you that if you're thinking about getting Lingthusiasm merch for any linguists or language enthusiasts in your life, if you want to get someone a scarf with the International Phonetic Alphabet, or tree symbol diagrams on them, or a tie with the IPA on it, or various baby outfits, or T-shirts that say, 'Not judging your grammar, just analysing it,' or many other things, now is a great time to place an order so that arrives towards the end of the year."

26,14,Lauren,"Speaking of the holiday season, it's a very important holiday season coming up that's the Northern Hemisphere winter conference season, which I'm usually excited about. Not doing so much travel this year."
26,15,Gretchen,"Well, the Australian Linguistic Society is also having its annual meeting in Adelaide in December, which I'm going to be at because I'm still in Australia. Our latest Patreon bonus episode is all about the academic conference circuit and how to make it work for you."
26,16,Lauren,"I had a lot of fun in this episode. This is all of mine and Gretchen's favourite survival tips for navigating academic conferences. If you've never been to one before, or you've only been to a couple, they're lots of fun, and they can be even more fun."
26,17,Gretchen,"Yes, so you can go to patreon.com/lingthusiasm to check those out, or lingthusiasm.com/merch for the merch. We'll repeat those links at the end of the episode, so you don't have to write them down now. [Music]"
26,18,Gretchen,"So, G and C are really weird letters because they're these two letters that, in a whole bunch of languages, often come with multiple sounds. You have the sounds in their names like /dʒ/ and /s/, and then you have other sounds like /g/ and /k/, and then even more sounds. These letters are so weird."
26,19,Lauren,"I'm not known for being the most reliable when it comes to a spelling bee, and I feel like it's often letters like G and C that trip me up because they have so many different pronunciation disguises that they put on."
26,20,Gretchen,They really do. They especially do that in different languages. You can do a brief sample of this through different languages' words for 'cheese.'
26,21,Lauren,"Ooo, let's do a cross-linguistic cheese platter!"
26,22,Gretchen,"Cross-linguistic cheese tour! First, we have the Latin 'caseus' (/kaseʊs/) meaning 'cheese.' And this gives rise to a whole bunch of other words for 'cheese' in different languages. You have English 'cheese' (/tʃi:z/), you have German 'Käse' (/ke:zə/), you have Spanish 'queso' (/keso/)."
26,23,Lauren,"Yeah. Because I was like, 'Well, in Italian you have 'formaggio,'' which is like a completely different historical word. But then I remembered that my favourite Italian pasta from Rome is cacio (/katʃo/) e pepe and that's -- the Italian-Latin word for 'cheese' is still hidden in that very excellent pasta dish."
26,24,Gretchen,"And then because I started thinking about this, I was looking up other languages' word for 'cheese,' and I saw the Dutch 'kaas' (/kɑːs/), which, I don't speak any Dutch, but there's one Dutch word that I know which is 'pindakaas,' and 'pindakaas' literally translates as 'peanut cheese.'"
26,25,Lauren,"Oh. Oh, hang on. Like peanut butter?"
26,26,Gretchen,"Yeah, so the Dutch word for 'peanut butter' is literally translated as 'peanut cheese,' which at first seems like, 'This is maybe an interesting dish,' but then you're like, 'Is 'peanut butter' really any better as a term for it?' Because it's still a dairy metaphor."
26,27,Lauren,"Yeah, because I was like, 'That's a weird choice,' but actually, it's not that different."
26,28,Gretchen,"It's really not that different at all. Especially, if you think of a cream cheese, which is like a creamier cheese, maybe? Peanut butter is kind of creamy sometimes."
26,29,Lauren,I'm still gonna eat it no matter what it's called.
26,30,Gretchen,"Then you have Irish 'cáis' (/kɑːʃ/), which is also from Latin 'caseus'. 'Caseus' is spelled with a C and an S. They're pronounced /k/ and /s/."
26,31,Lauren,Yeah.
26,32,Gretchen,"But 'cheese' takes that initial /k/ and makes it /tʃ/. 'Käse' and 'queso' and 'cacio' keep that initial /k/ sound at the beginning, but 'cacio' changes the /s/ into /tʃ/."
26,33,Lauren,Yeah.
26,34,Gretchen,Dutch keeps it the way it was. And then Irish also changes the second one into 'cáis' (/kɑːʃ/). Different languages have taken this one word that seemed like it had a fairly straightforward pronunciation and altered it in slightly different ways.
26,35,Lauren,"I was trying to make a cheese metaphor about things, like, fermenting and going funky with age, but I guess this is why we're a linguistics podcast and not a food podcast."
26,36,Gretchen,"'Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a food podcast about linguistics.' And this is all this weird stuff that C gets up to between different languages, historically, and in different languages in the modern era. G does the same type of thing. If you were a kid, you might have learned about hard G and soft G, or hard C and soft C."
26,37,Lauren,"I really struggle with the idea of hard C and soft C, and hard G and soft G. Just to help other people who might as well, hard G is the /g/ sound and soft G is when it's used more like /ʒ/."
26,38,Gretchen,"Yes, /ʒ/ or /dʒ/, which is one of the reasons why this terminology is not generally linguist-approved."
26,39,Lauren,"Yeah, I just -- I think about, for example, when I was chatting with Suzy Styles on the work we do about how we have this cross-sensory idea and 'hard' and 'soft' as a metaphor just don't work for me for those sounds. Apologies if I leave Gretchen to do all of the explaining the difference between them today."
26,40,Gretchen,"Well, I don't think I'm really going to use the terms either. I'm just gonna mention the specific sound because you see when it happens cross-linguistically, there's a lot more going on than just that. These are two letters that both have that hard-soft thing going on. We don't talk about 'hard Q' and 'soft Q,' or 'hard P' and 'soft P.'"
26,41,Lauren,Yeah.
26,42,Gretchen,"So why do these letters come in hard and soft versions, even if you can't remember which version is which? To do this, we need to also go back to the Romans."
26,43,Lauren,"Yes, there were simpler times back in Old Latin."
26,44,Gretchen,"The Latin alphabet comes from Greek, as a lot of people know. But this is one of things that always puzzled me as a kid -- because I was a kid who was into the Greek alphabet -- I was like, 'Look, the Greeks have this letter, kappa, which stands for the K sound, and it looks like a K, and it's where we get the modern K. And they have this letter, gamma, which was very clearly supposed to be a G. Who invented the C? Why is it there, and why does it cause me so much trouble?'"
26,45,Lauren,Yeah.
26,46,Gretchen,"It turns out that this is explained by the Etruscans, who were people that didn't make a distinction between the /g/ sound and the /k/ sound, like the sound in 'gamma' and the sound in 'kappa.' They borrowed the Greek alphabet for their language, which we don't know very much about, but we know that they didn't care about the difference between gamma and kappa because they just borrowed one, which was gamma, and they used it for both because it didn't really matter for them. Then, the Romans actually didn't initially borrow their alphabet from the Greeks. They borrowed it from the Etruscans."
26,47,Lauren,"Because the Etruscans were living on the Italian peninsula, so they just borrowed it from the locals."
26,48,Gretchen,"Yeah, so they just borrowed it from the locals."
26,49,Lauren,"I do love an ethically locally sourced alphabet, personally."
26,50,Gretchen,"Nice, locally sourced alphabet. We have fragments of pottery from the Etruscans, but we don't know a whole lot about their language. We know it wasn't Indo-European because all the Indo-European languages do distinguish between the gamma and the kappa sounds. So the Romans borrow it from the Etruscans, and then they're left with like, 'Oh, geez, we actually do want to make this distinction between these two sounds that we have, but the Etruscans don't have.'"
26,51,Lauren,And so someone invented the letter G.
26,52,Gretchen,Like an actual person?
26,53,Lauren,"Apparently. I mean, I'm quoting from Wikipedia."
26,54,Gretchen,Do we know their name?
26,55,Lauren,"Apparently, his name was Spurius Carvilius Ruga, which definitely doesn't sound like a spurious name at all."
26,56,Gretchen,That's a really spurious name. So he invented the letter G?
26,57,Lauren,"Yeah, so at this point the letter C was the third letter in the alphabet, still, and he was like, 'Well, look, we have this /k/ sound.' K wasn't cool anymore as a letter to represent /k/. They were all using the rounded -- what we think of as C now. He was like, 'We need to make more of a distinction.' And so apparently -- there are people who disagree with this, but I like this story about young Spurius -- created the letter G and was like, 'Now, we can make the distinction again.'"
26,58,Gretchen,"If you look at a capital G, it just looks like a C with an extra stroke added on to it, right?"
26,59,Lauren,Yeah.
26,60,Gretchen,"A gamma is like a right angle in the top left corner (Γ), and then you can curve it to make a C, and then you can add an extra stroke to make the G."
26,61,Lauren,"So that's where the Romans got to. And he popped it in the alphabet in the seventh position, which is originally where a little Greek letter known as 'zeta' used to live."
26,62,Gretchen,So is he responsible for the demotion of zeta as well?
26,63,Lauren,"Yeah. I mean, well, no, Z also wasn't cool anymore, because the Romans didn't need it, so they never really borrowed it from the Greeks. Because, again, they got all their alphabet from the Etruscans. So the Romans weren't really down with --"
26,64,Gretchen,"Oh, that's it. Okay."
26,65,Lauren,"-- zeta. They kind of had it there. He's was like, 'Well, let's just drop that letter out, and we'll add this cool, new G thing that I invented.'"
26,66,Gretchen,So he kicked out zeta and replaced it with G?
26,67,Lauren,Yeah.
26,68,Gretchen,That's great. I love that. Latin actually pronounced -- all of their C's and G's were /k/ and /g/.
26,69,Lauren,"Imagine doing a Latin spelling bee. It would be so great. I mean, I guess that's why they don't have spelling bees in most languages that have regular orthographies."
26,70,Gretchen,"Yeah, so easy! You know, you have your classic Latin phrase 'veni vidi vici' (/weni widi wiki/) 'I came. I saw. I conquered.'"
26,71,Lauren,"I like that you've used the original Latin pronunciation there, so you sound a little bit ridiculous."
26,72,Gretchen,"I'd always pronounced this /vɛni vidi vitʃi/, but then I had a Latin teacher who told me, 'No, no, it's actually /weni widi wiki/,' and it just sounds so foolish."
26,73,Lauren,"Yes, every time I hear it. So that ""vici' is the C -- what we think of as C -- being pronounced as /k/, as in the word for 'cheese.'"
26,74,Gretchen,"Then, in Late Latin, everything starts to go wrong. And by 'wrong,' I mean 'great.'"
26,75,Lauren,For the Empire as well as the language.
26,76,Gretchen,"Yeah, the Empire was a bit messed up. But also the language started fragmenting and becoming all these different versions. In many of the different areas, people started pronouncing the C and the G in a different way, sometimes."
26,77,Lauren,"I love the 'sometimes' bit. We talk about the environment that sounds are in can make them change, adds a bit of context. And that's really where the fun and the messiness of language can really play out, when you have language changing over time."
26,78,Gretchen,"Yeah, we need to talk about a particular area of the mouth. This is the roof of your mouth. I'm touching it right now, but you can't see me, because it's inside. This isn't gonna be a very useful demonstration."
26,79,Lauren,"If you have clean-enough hands, and you don't mind looking a bit ridiculous in public, you can turn the tip of your finger up to the ceiling and press it into the roof of your mouth or use your tongue."
26,80,Gretchen,"This is the back part of the roof of your mouth. Not the front bit right behind your teeth, but the back bit by your molars. There's kind of a little lump there. This is known in linguistics as the 'palate.' There's a whole bunch of sounds that involve the palate and involve some sort of constriction at the palate, the back part of the roof of your mouth."
26,81,Lauren,It's a big chunk of space. You've got that soft bit further towards the back that you might not want to prod if you have a sensitive gag reflex.
26,82,Gretchen,"Yeah, we don't advise that."
26,83,Lauren,And you have that hard bit closer to the teeth. There's a lot of space to play with there.
26,84,Gretchen,"Yeah, so there's a lot of space. You can drop your jaw and let a lot of space happen there. What's crucial about the palate is it's a space where you can make both vowels and consonants. You could make an /i/ sound, and your tongue will be towards your palate. You can make a /j/ sound, and your tongue will be towards your palate. You could make a /ʃ/ sound, and your tongue will be towards your palate."
26,85,Lauren,"I'm just sitting here quietly going 'sh, sh, sh' to myself."
26,86,Gretchen,"I was teaching a roomful of Intro to Linguistics students about the palate, and I was saying, 'Okay, we're gonna make a distinction between where S is produced, which is towards the front of the roof of your mouth --"" and we don't call that the 'palate,' we we use the 'palate' just refer to the back part of the roof of your mouth -- 'and the /ʃ/ sound, which is on the palate or near the palate.' I was getting the room to say 'sss,' 'shh,' 'sss,' 'shh,' back and forth. Then, I was like, 'You guys thought you were enrolled in Intro to Linguistics, but you're actually enrolled in Intro to Parseltongue.'"
26,87,Lauren,"The very 'sss-shh'-y sounds of the snake language of Harry Potter, for the three of you out there who aren't familiar. If you don't feel like making these sounds, or you want to see what other people's tongues are doing, as always with these episodes, I'm linking you to one of my favourite websites, which is where they stuck a bunch of phoneticians in an MRI machine, and you can see their tongues doing all these things, if you just click on the column of sounds called Palatals."
26,88,Gretchen,"That's great. I like that website so much. So the palatals, and the /dʒ/ sound is also towards the palatals. At least it's a lot more similar to the palatals than /k/ and /g/."
26,89,Lauren,"In contrast, /k/ and /g/ are made a bit further back from the palate, closer towards the back of the mouth."
26,90,Gretchen,"If you're just thinking about these palatal sounds, the thing is that because there are both vowels and consonants that can be palatal, and you have a vowel that's produced near the palate, and a consonant near it, the vowel tends to attract the consonant and make it more palatal and make it more similar to each other, because humans like to be efficient about these things."
26,91,Lauren,"Even if you don't remember any terminology, and you certainly don't have to, the takeaway here is that our mouths are very good at being lazy, and they will strive to do as little moving as possible. It's like, 'If I'm already there for the vowel, why am I taking myself all the way to the back of the palate? I'm just gonna hang here.' I'm always happy to celebrate laziness."
26,92,Gretchen,"These palatal vowels, these vowels that are produced near the palate, tend to pull certain consonants with them. This is what happened to the /k/ and the /g/ sound."
26,93,Lauren,And it didn't necessarily happen the same way in all the different languages that descend from Latin.
26,94,Gretchen,"Right, so in French, which is probably the most familiar to English because we borrowed a lot of words from French -- so, sometimes you have /k/ becoming /s/ in English from Latin, sometimes you have it becoming /tʃ/ in English from Latin. You have things like 'caseus' becoming 'cheese,' but also something like 'circus' (/kirkus/) becoming 'circus' (/sɝkəs/). All those /k/'s get pulled more towards the roof of the mouth."
26,95,Lauren,"But only if the vowel is luring them there, right? If the vowel isn't near that palatal bit, if the vowel is already back where the /k/ is, then it just stays there."
26,96,Gretchen,"Yeah, so that's the thing. In a word like 'circus' the /k/ is before an I, which was pronounced /i/, /sirkus/, whereas, the second C is before a U and that one stays /sirkus/, not /sirsus/."
26,97,Lauren,"I like how I'm like, '/sirkus/ sounds completely normal. /sirsus/ sounds very wrong.'"
26,98,Gretchen,"Yeah, /sirsus/ is just like, 'No, that didn't happen.' So, /i/ and /e/, which became I and E in English, are the ones that tend to pull the consonants towards them. Whereas /u/ and /o/ and /a/ are the ones that let the constant stay where they want to be."
26,99,Lauren,"Which solves a mystery of -- I mean, spelling bees are entirely mysterious to me, as I think we've established -- but it solves that mystery of spelling bees, because I was always like, 'Why would you ask...' -- because you can ask in a spelling bee the origin of a word. And so if you ask like, 'I have to spell the word 'circus.' Please, spelling bee master, tell me the origin of the word.' If I know it's a Latin word, like, 'Well, that means it probably is C-I and not K-I, because originally it was probably /kirkus/'"
26,100,Gretchen,"Yeah, because you don't have K's in Latinate words because all of their C's changed when they were in front of an I or an E."
26,101,Lauren,Yeah.
26,102,Gretchen,This also explains why there's some disagreement about how to pronounce the word 'Celtic.'
26,103,Lauren,"Oh, yeah, there's a really great post by Stan Carey that goes into the history of this, but -- I don't know. I have to think really hard if I say /kɛltɪk/ or /sɛltɪk/. But I think I say /kɛltɪk/."
26,104,Gretchen,"I definitely say /kɛltɪk/, but there's some sports team that's correctly pronounced /sɛltɪk/, because that's what people say when they talk about the sports team?"
26,105,Lauren,Right.
26,106,Gretchen,"I've definitely heard people say /sɛltɪk/. This is one of those ones where if you're obeying the Latinate rules, you're like, 'Well, C-E, that must mean that the C is pronounced like an S.' And yet -- because when Irish and Scottish Gaelics borrowed the Latin alphabet, it also hadn't had this sound change happen yet. All the C's were still pronounced like /k/, so all of the C's in Gaelic are hard. And so 'Celt' /kɛlt/ is -- there's no K in Gaelic. The C's are all pronounced /k/."
26,107,Lauren,Right.
26,108,Gretchen,"So if you use the Gaelic pronunciation, then it's /kɛlt/, but if you're looking at it, and you're like, 'Well, but I thought my rule was the C gets pronounced like S,' then it's /sɛlt/."
26,109,Lauren,"Which brings us to another major scandal in terms of how words are pronounced, which is, of course, the word that I say as /dʒɪbəɹɪʃ/ (gibberish)."
26,110,Gretchen,And the word that I said on a previous episode as /gɪbəɹɪʃ/ because -- I don't know. Why not say it that way?
26,111,Lauren,"Yeah, I -- to be honest -- had not paid much attention to your pronunciation, but we had quite a few people draw attention to the fact that we have different pronunciations for this word."
26,112,Gretchen,"Yeah, and this is the same thing like with /dʒɪf/ and /gɪf/ (GIF) where --"
26,113,Lauren,Which is definitely not a major argument at all.
26,114,Gretchen,"No, no one cares about that one on the internet. I've never heard any argument about it. With the G's, when we get a word from French, or from Latin, or from Italian, or sometimes from Spanish -- but generally, Spanish, that's its own thing -- we tend to pronounce that G as a /dʒ/ or a /ʒ/ like in 'rouge.' But when we get it from a different language, we often pronounce it as a /g/ instead."
26,115,Lauren,Yeah.
26,116,Gretchen,"So of course, when we get it from an acronym like with GIF, all bets are off, really. There's no statistical bias in either direction."
26,117,Lauren,"We have been talking exclusively about C and G, but they are not the only letters that cause me grief with spelling, which is fundamentally about palatalisation. There are other sounds in English that are also very attracted to the palate."
26,118,Gretchen,"Yeah, and these are both /t/ and /d/, T and D, and /s/ and /z/, or S and Z. They're pronounced more towards the front of the palate, but, again, if they're in front of an /i/ or an /e/ sound, they tend to get pulled back towards the palate instead of pulled forward. They all get pulled toward the centre of the mouth."
26,119,Lauren,The palate is like the black hole at the centre of the mouth universe.
26,120,Gretchen,"It's got gravity pulling everything towards it. Yeah, it's a very attractive place. I think it's also kind of a very easy place to say because it's just right there in the middle. So it could be anything. You don't have to go to a lot of effort to make it happen."
26,121,Lauren,"Yeah, the tongue is just kind of going straight up from its neutral spot. What kind of examples do we see with these letters?"
26,122,Gretchen,"There's some ones that are really old that are embedded into English spelling, words like 'station' and 'ratio' with that T-I-O-N ending. They were at one point pronounced like /statiʌn/ and /ratio/."
26,123,Lauren,"Again, would have made spelling tests a lot easier."
26,124,Gretchen,"Way easier, /ratio/! The Romans said this. But /ratʃio/, /io/ gets shortened into /raʃio/ or /steʃiʌn/ and eventually gets /steʃʌn/ and /reʃio/, and other words like that. Then there's also some that are super new, and they're not even reflected in standard English spelling. They're only in representations of informal speech. That's the words like ""didja?'"
26,125,Lauren,"As in, 'Didja find out any good facts about palatalisation? Yes, I did.'"
26,126,Gretchen,"Yeah! If you have 'did' and 'you' -- well, 'you' can become 'ya,' obviously. Then that 'ya' sound, the Y at the beginning, it's also palatal, so it can pull the D towards /dɪdʒə/. I went to . a really great restaurant when I was in New York City a couple months ago, which was pointed out to me by someone on Twitter as a linguistically interesting restaurant that I should go to. It is called 'Jeet Jet.'"
26,127,Lauren,'Jeet Jet?'
26,128,Gretchen,"'Jeet Jet,' spelled J-E-E-T J-E-T."
26,129,Lauren,"Oh, as in, 'Did you eat yet?'"
26,130,Gretchen,Yeah.
26,131,Lauren,'Jeet Jet.'
26,132,Gretchen,'Jeet Jet?'
26,133,Lauren,That was great. Everything is just lapsing into the palatal centre.
26,134,Gretchen,So palatal! It's a palatal palace of food.
26,135,Lauren,This is why we're not a food podcast.
26,136,Gretchen,"Every so often when I used to mark linguistics papers for Intro to Linguistics, you'd get somebody who would write -- instead of 'palatal,' they'd write 'palatial.'"
26,137,Lauren,Did you draw a little palace?
26,138,Gretchen,"It sounds like it's a little palace! But also, why is it not 'palatial' because 'palatial' is actually the palatised version of 'palatal?'"
26,139,Lauren,It makes sense. We might have to let the language kick on for another couple of centuries to let that process happen.
26,140,Gretchen,"What's really cool about palatals is that they keep going with the trajectories of the language. In French and Italian, the C's and G's became /dʒ/and /ʒ/ and /ʃ/ and /s/, and that's pretty well-established. In Spanish, they did this other thing. The Spanish C in front of E or I went to /θ/ in Spain, like 'cerveza' (/θerbeθa/), and to /s/ in South America like /serbesa/. The J, and G, and also the X -- they're now like a /h/ sound, like in 'Xavier' (/havier/). But they stopped for a while at a /ʃ/ sound. For a while, this X in Spanish was pronounced /ʃ/."
26,141,Lauren,"Hmm, just hung out there for a while?"
26,142,Gretchen,"Yeah, you can see that trajectory happening. It happened at a very specific point in Spanish history, because this point when X was being pronounced /ʃ/ also happened right around when the Spanish conquerors were first coming in contact with Nahuatl speakers in Central America. In Nahuatl, there was a sound /ʃ/, and the Spanish speakers were like, 'Well, we have a letter to represent /ʃ/. It's an X. We're going to use the X to represent /ʃ/ like we do in our own language.' They transcribed certain Nahuatl words, like the word 'Mexico' -- /meʃiko/ -- perfectly reasonably."
26,143,Lauren,Yeah.
26,144,Gretchen,"But then Spanish kept changing, and not a lot of people spoke Nahuatl, and so /meʃiko/ became /mehiko/, because the X sound was shifted from /ʃ/ to /h/."
26,145,Lauren,"And so 'Mexico,' did the pronunciation of it -- just went with it even though it was meant to be /ʃ/?"
26,146,Gretchen,A representation of the Nahuatl word.
26,147,Lauren,"Ah, there you go."
26,148,Gretchen,"Other languages looked at it -- like English looked at the spelling of this word and said, 'Well, you have an X there. We have an X.'"
26,149,Lauren,'We pronounce it /ks/.'
26,150,Gretchen,"'Here's how we pronounce the X.' And this is where we get /mɛksɪko/, but it's actually an attempt at representing this Nahuatl sound, but then Spanish changed out from under it."
26,151,Lauren,"It reminds me of when 'Beijing' was updated from the older word, 'Peking.' We still have 'Peking' in 'Peking Duck,' and you have that /k/ there in the '-king.' When it was updated, it becomes '-jing,' because over the centuries since it was originally written down, palatalisation has occurred in Mandarin Chinese."
26,152,Gretchen,"Oh, that's so good! I just thought the Europeans are really incompetent at transcribing things."
26,153,Lauren,"I mean, the Europeans were pretty incompetent, and I'm sure that was part of the problem. But you actually have that palatalisation happening in Mandarin as well. It's not just an Indo-European phenomenon."
26,154,Gretchen,"Oh, so there's just a sound change happening in Mandarin as well at the same time. That's so good."
26,155,Lauren,Yeah.
26,156,Gretchen,"There's also a really interesting historical example of other languages doing palatalisation, because once you can spot palatalisation, you can find it everywhere. It's in so many languages. I'd be honestly more surprised to find a language that had never done any sort of palatalisation -- that hadn't done it -- than I would be surprised to find it in another language. Bantu languages, which are spoken in a wide swath of Africa, they have a set of prefixes that go at the beginning of certain nouns and verbs to indicate which category the nouns belong to, in a very, very simple explanation of that. One of these prefixes is used before a noun to make it the language related to that noun."
26,157,Lauren,Right.
26,158,Gretchen,"So you have things like -- in the Congo, the language that's spoken is Kikongo."
26,159,Lauren,Yeah.
26,160,Gretchen,"In Rwanda, the language that's spoken is Kinyarwanda. In Botswana, the language that spoken is Setswana. What's really interesting here is that this prefix, you can tell it's started out as /ki/, but in some languages it's become /tʃi/ or /ʃi/ or /si/ or /se/. You can tell that's because this palatal vowel has brought it more towards the vowel. So you have Kiswahili, but isiZulu or isiXhosa], or Tshivenda. Some of them still have the /ki/, some of them have changed it to /si/ or /tʃi/. You can see this relationship because they all have the same prefix, but it's changed differently because the sound changes have happened differently in the different languages."
26,161,Lauren,Exactly the same set of changes as we get with our cheeses of Europe.
26,162,Gretchen,The same cheese-changes. I have a very vivid memory about when I first learned about palatalisation. This was when I went to Scottish Gaelic summer camp when I was 10 or 12?
26,163,Lauren,"The thing is we don't have summer camps in Australia. So I find all summer camps mysterious. I'm like, 'Of course, you went on summer camp for Gaelic. Like, that's that weird thing that North Americans do. They go on summer camp.'"
26,164,Gretchen,"It is not very common to go on summer camp for Gaelic. Most of the other kids that were there, were there to learn, like, fiddle, or step dance, or something, which is still fairly rare. Most people go, like, canoeing or something."
26,165,Lauren,Okay.
26,166,Gretchen,"But I was a budding linguist, and I wanted to learn Gaelic. So when I was learning Gaelic, they told me about this distinction between broad vowels and slender vowels. This is super important in Gaelic and in Irish as well, because a whole bunch of consonants in Gaelic change the way they're pronounced depending on which vowels they're next to."
26,167,Lauren,Right.
26,168,Gretchen,"So you end up with all these silent vowels where the vowel itself is silent, but it's just being used to tell you how to pronounce the consonant that it's next to."
26,169,Lauren,"This is a bit like when I realised the reason you don't hear, in Spanish or in English -- the word 'guitar,' you don't hear that U -- is because Spanish uses U in the same way there, to indicate that it should be a /g/ and not a /ʒɪtɑɹ/."
26,170,Gretchen,"Exactly, it means the same U that's in, like, 'Guillaume' to indicate that that is a /g/ -- or in 'guerre,' 'guerrilla,' for 'war.'"
26,171,Lauren,"Yeah, it was a complete revelation for me when I was like, 'I'm not meant to -- the U is just there to help me, not to hinder me.'"
26,172,Gretchen,"Yeah, it's to help you according to a completely different system that you only understand incompletely."
26,173,Lauren,Yeah.
26,174,Gretchen,"This is the same thing for Gaelic. If you have a word, 'fáilte,' which is the word for 'welcome,' and the last two letters are T-E, the way you know that that T is pronounced like a /tʃ/ is because there's an E next to it. Or if you have names like 'Sean,' or 'Sinead,' or 'Siobhan,' the way that you know that that S is pronounced like a /ʃ/ is because it has an E or an I next to it."
26,175,Lauren,"Just, like, 'Come with me towards the palate.'"
26,176,Gretchen,"This is the kind of thing that they teach you in Gaelic 101. They're like, 'Here's the broad vowels. Here's the slender vowels. Here's why they're so important,' because they tell you how to do this with all your consonants. And yet, afterwards, I was like, 'But English also kind of does this. Because if you have a word like 'circus,' the way that you know how each of the C's is pronounced is based on the same distinction between what Gaelic traditionally calls 'broad' and 'slender' vowels, but we can call 'palatal' or 'non-palatal' vowels. The slender vowels in Gaelic are the same thing as a palatal vowel, or a front vowel to use the proper linguistic term. All of those are the same class of things that all cause the same types of sound changes. The 'broad' vowels, or the 'non-palatal' vowels, or the 'back' vowels are all the same category of stuff that doesn't cause the sound change. And that totally rocked my world when I figured it out the first time."
26,177,Lauren,"I think the thing is, given my general spelling issues, even though I have trouble with spelling, I really appreciate that palatalisation makes pronouncing things easier. In many ways, it's really great that the writing system we have captures this history of how these sounds were all the way back to Latin, all the way back to our friend Spurius, and they're there to help us."
26,178,Gretchen,"Yeah, it makes certain connections easier to see. A word like 'electric,' 'electricity,' the C is still there, and when you add an I on to it with the '-ity' ending, you can see it change pronunciation. You can see the connections between those words more straightforwardly. Whereas, if there was a K at the end, you wouldn't necessarily know that it was one that was going to change its pronunciation if an I was added to it. I think what fascinates me about palatalisation is it's one of the ways in which linguistics lets us peer deeply into the soul of a language, or into history of a language, and into the connections between languages, and lets us think of these things that we think of as messy and anomalous as actually a unified part of our shared anatomy across all of the spoken languages that we have this in common, which is that we all find it easier to pronounce things in a certain area of our mouths the same. That makes us part of this really big human story in what seems to be just annoying ways to spell things. [Music]"

27,1,Lauren,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics! I'm Lauren Gawne."
27,2,Gretchen,"And I'm Gretchen McCulloch, and today, we're getting enthusiastic about words for family members -- kinship terms! But first, we're looking forward to 2019. It's almost here. We're very excited to continue with the regular show. We have some exciting plans -- like video episodes."
27,3,Lauren,"We've had a really exciting 2018. We've done lots of really cool stuff. You've been along for the ride, and we're really looking forward to continuing with regular episodes and other exciting things in 2019."
27,4,Gretchen,"And we just hit our goal to make a special video episode about the linguistics of gesture, which is super exciting."
27,5,Lauren,It was also really great to have Gretchen in Australia when we hit the goal for the gesture videos. That happened while she was out on her trip to do the live shows. We had celebratory ice cream. It was very exciting.
27,6,Gretchen,"Yes, so that was fantastic. We're looking forward to the next goal, which is going to be a special video episode interviewing a deaf linguist about the linguistics of sign language. Stay tuned for which sign language and which linguist we're going to be interviewing for that once we hit that goal."
27,7,Lauren,"Our latest bonus Patreon episode is a Q&A that we did while we were in the same geographic location, which you can find on patreon.com/lingthusiasm."
27,8,Gretchen,"Yes, as well as 20 previous bonus episodes, which is almost an entire double Lingthusiasm. You should definitely check that out if you haven't already."
27,9,Lauren,"We also both have other exciting 2019 adventures. I am having a baby, which we mentioned a couple of episodes ago. That will take up a fair amount of my 2019, I feel."
27,10,Gretchen,"I feel like babies are pretty busy. But the episodes will continue as scheduled. I have a book coming out in July 2019, so you'll also hear --"
27,11,Lauren,A book baby!
27,12,Gretchen,A book baby! I wonder which one is gonna be cuter. We probably shouldn't have that competition.
27,13,Lauren,They're cute in their own ways.
27,14,Gretchen,"One of them will eventually learn to talk back, and it won't be the book. If you wanna see what the cover looks like, and for pre-order information, you can check out the link in the show notes or on my website as well. [Music]"
27,15,Gretchen,"So, Lauren, here is an important linguistic question -- what are you gonna have your baby call you? Are you gonna be a 'Mama,' a 'Mum,' a 'Mummy?'"
27,16,Lauren,"I haven't thought about this, which means I guess that I'm just gonna go with my socio-cultural norms, so I'm probably gonna be 'mum.'"
27,17,Gretchen,"Okay, that's very standard, yeah. It seems legit."
27,18,Lauren,Yeah.
27,19,Gretchen,"I mean, I have some friends who called their parents -- or had their kids call them by their first names."
27,20,Lauren,"Oh, yeah, that always seems really weird to me. If I call my parents by their first name, it's because we're having some kind of very silly conversation."
27,21,Gretchen,"I think I only do it if I'm at a grocery store, or a park, or something, and I need to catch their attention, and saying 'Mom' or 'Dad' isn't working, and so I'm like, 'I guess I should say their name to get them to turn around.' Maybe that's a thing you could do."
27,22,Lauren,I love how it's such a conscious decision for you.
27,23,Gretchen,"Definitely not part of my norm, but it is part of some people's norms."
27,24,Lauren,"Yeah, I know people whose kids call them by their first name just because they find the idea of being 'Mum' or 'Dad' really weird."
27,25,Gretchen,"I also know people who find the idea of 'Mum' or 'Dad' being weird. They go by something like 'Mama,' or 'Papa' or, you know, things like --"
27,26,Lauren,"Or they have some kind of cultural -- I have people whose families have Italian heritage, so they're 'Mama' or 'Papa.' I knew someone at school who had a 'Grandmother,' but her friend at school had a 'Nonna.' And she was like, 'Well, that word sounds cool.' And so she just started calling her very Anglo-Australian grandmother 'Nonna' even though there's no family history of Italian naming in their family."
27,27,Gretchen,That's very cute.
27,28,Lauren,"It was really cute. So sometimes people will deviate -- every family has its own idiosyncrasies. Sometimes, they pop up in the kinship terminology that people use."
27,29,Gretchen,"I think, especially for grandparents, those seem to be a little bit more idiosyncratic, whether cultural or there're just more names for grandparents. Like, 'Mama,' and 'Papa,' and 'Da-Da' seem to be very common across different languages. Whereas, whether you say 'Nana,' or 'Nonna,' or 'Opa,' or 'Oma,' or these kinds of things, tend to be a bit more different."
27,30,Lauren,We have both a 'Grandfather' and a 'Pop' in terms of my grandparents.
27,31,Gretchen,"Yeah, I had both 'Grandad' and 'Papa,' then, for the grandmothers, both 'Mimi' and 'GG,' which are idiosyncratic names."
27,32,Lauren,'Mimi' and 'GG?'
27,33,Gretchen,"Yeah, my --"
27,34,Lauren,Where did they come from?
27,35,Gretchen,"Well, so 'GG' comes from the fact that that grandmother was named 'Gretchen,' who I was named after. So 'GG' stands for 'Grandma Gretchen.' And her grandmother --"
27,36,Lauren,"Oh, that's so great. Like, lovely and meta."
27,37,Gretchen,"Yeah, and her grandmother was also named 'Gretchen,' who she was named after, so she had a 'GG.' Sometimes she used to say, 'Well, my GG blah blah blah...' So I've always known in a weird way that if I had grandkids, I already have a grandma name."
27,38,Lauren,"Wow, that's a lot of presupposition there, Gretchen."
27,39,Gretchen,"Because, clearly, I have to continue the tradition of 'GG' if I have kids -- if I have grandkids."
27,40,Lauren,It'll be a nice story.
27,41,Gretchen,"Yeah, and 'Mimi' -- I, apparently, at around the age of one or two, gave this name to my grandmother because I was the oldest grandkid on this side. That's what I apparently started calling her, and it stuck."
27,42,Lauren,Cool. You created language change within your family.
27,43,Gretchen,I was pre-linguist!
27,44,Lauren,You're a linguist innovator.
27,45,Gretchen,"Yeah, but my grandmother Mimi used to joke that 'Mimi' and 'GG' sounded like two little French poodles or something like this."
27,46,Lauren,They do. It's very cute.
27,47,Gretchen,"I think, especially in English, kids often end up creating or using different terms from different cultures because it's really useful in a family context to be able to distinguish between maternal and paternal grandparents. And yet, this is not something that English has built-in words to do. Whereas, other languages do."
27,48,Lauren,"Yeah, and when you start looking at -- we have all these different things that we call different members of our family -- so different kinship terms -- and we start looking at how different parts of the family get segmented up and what different languages and cultures pay attention to. You start to realise that some languages lump together a whole bunch of people that we might separate out into different terms. English is very good at lumping together groups of people that have distinct kinship terms in other languages and cultures. It's always really fun to learn those different systems and start thinking about how your family relate to each other in different ways."
27,49,Gretchen,"Yeah, I haven't really -- most of the languages that I've worked with have been European, so I haven't done a whole lot with languages that have other kinship terms. But there're some different forms in Syuba, right?"
27,50,Lauren,"Yeah, when I'm in Nepal, when people ask about my family, I suddenly have to start thinking about -- for example, aunts and uncles. It varies depending upon whether they're your uncles on your dad's side or your uncles on your mother's side. In Syuba, your 'Ao' is your father's brother, and your 'Ashang' is your mother's brother. So your uncles on each side have different names. And then, in terms of your aunts, there's actually a whole bunch of different terms. The aunts on your mother's side all get called 'Ama,' which is the same as the word for mother --"
27,51,Gretchen,"Oh, interesting."
27,52,Lauren,"-- and so you distinguish them by saying 'Ama Chombo' or 'Ama Chame,' which means your 'big mother,' your aunts that are older than your mother, and your 'Ama Chame' are your aunts on your mother's side that are younger than your mother."
27,53,Gretchen,"Oh, so that's also distinguished -- the older versus younger side."
27,54,Lauren,"Yeah, and it's not that people don't know -- just to make it clear. It's not that people don't know that their mother is different from their aunt. It's just that that's how the system -- I know that my uncles on my dad's side are different to the uncles on my mom's side. I just don't think about it that much day-to-day."
27,55,Gretchen,But something I find really interesting is that English doesn't distinguish between uncle-by-marriage or aunt-by-marriage versus uncle and aunt that are actually your blood relatives.
27,56,Lauren,No.
27,57,Gretchen,"Personally, I have a distinction, I guess, between uncles and aunts that were already in the family when I was a kid and the ones that have subsequently married my uncles or aunts after I got older because the ones that were in the family when I was a kid, I call them all 'Uncle' and 'Aunt.' And that's fine. The ones that showed up when I was already a teenager, towards adulthood, I'm like -- I just call them by their names because I didn't have that -- they were first introduced to me, I guess, as, 'This is the boyfriend or girlfriend or person that so-and-so is dating.' And so, I spent a couple years knowing them just by their name for that reason. And then, when they got married, I didn't switch over to calling them 'Uncle' or 'Aunt' even though, technically, they are. But somehow, that doesn't work for me in the same way as the ones that I've known as part of the family ever since I was a kid."
27,58,Lauren,"It's like, for you, the terminology involves some kind of entrenchment within the family system."
27,59,Gretchen,"Yeah, or like, 'Did I know you as a child,' or something like that seems to be the factor, which is definitely not a factor that is officially encoded into any kinship system I've ever encountered but seems to be encoded in my personal kinship system."
27,60,Lauren,Which always makes these things more interesting.
27,61,Gretchen,"Yeah, there's the official kinship systems and then there's the personal, idiosyncratic kinship systems. But there are languages that have different terms for relatives by marriage as well."
27,62,Lauren,"Yeah, so your aunts on your mother's side are your 'Ama,' but if it's your father's brother's wife it's 'Tsitsi.' Whereas, your aunts who are your father's relatives -- so younger sisters -- are 'Ani.'"
27,63,Gretchen,"Oh, interesting. Okay."
27,64,Lauren,"And so, you know who was married into the family as opposed to who is a sister of your father."
27,65,Gretchen,And there's more terms on the aunt side than on the uncle side?
27,66,Lauren,"Because aunts can marry into families or marry out of families. In this culture, it's the women who move house when they get married. So your uncles are always around whether they're your father's brothers or your mother's brothers. Whereas, women aren't bringing uncles into the house, necessarily. They're less important to you."
27,67,Gretchen,"Your uncles-in-law -- you're gonna have less contact with them, so they don't have a distinct term for them."
27,68,Lauren,Yeah.
27,69,Gretchen,"I mean, you could say 'uncles-in-law' or 'aunts-in-law.' I don't know why we don't."
27,70,Lauren,I find the whole 'in-law' terminology in English very confusing. If I were gonna fix English --
27,71,Gretchen,You would fix the in-laws?
27,72,Lauren,"The kinship system does need a bit of a makeover, and the in-lawing is very confusing because -- I mean, to me, it's confusing because so many people in my family have long-term partners who aren't married. I like to refer to them as 'out-laws.'"
27,73,Gretchen,I think a lot of people use the out-law terminology as a jocular version of in-laws.
27,74,Lauren,But it does kind of upset my grandparents.
27,75,Gretchen,"See, my family says 'out-laws' all the time."
27,76,Lauren,"Whereas, it amuses me that -- say, my brother's partner technically has the same terminology as my partner's sibling's partner."
27,77,Gretchen,"Yeah, that double layer. Maybe there should be 'in-law-in-law.' Like, 'brother in-law-in-law' should be the one that's two steps from you?"
27,78,Lauren,"Yeah, I guess it depends on how close you feel to people as well. I generally don't refer to my 'sister-in-law.' I just refer to her by name."
27,79,Gretchen,"Yeah, I mean, that's fair, too."
27,80,Lauren,It's a bit like the aunts-and-uncles thing. It's too hard to assimilate you into my pre-existing kinship structure.
27,81,Gretchen,"Well, and that's the thing because, especially, if your siblings are having partners -- assuming you're fairly close in age to your siblings -- you're probably encountering those partners -- you've already gone through your childhood acquisition of who your family is. And then, suddenly, your sibling's bringing in somebody new. And it's like -- at what point do you switch over to that? Is it when they start living together? Is it when -- do they have to have a formal wedding? Where do these things change? Maybe that's part of the idiosyncratic system."
27,82,Lauren,"We've distinguished some cultures have terms that vary depending whether it's on your mother or father's side, terms that differ depending on if someone's older or younger. And, again, Syuba distinguishes siblings that are older or younger. 'Older sister' is 'Adzi,' but 'younger sister' is 'Nomo.' 'Older brother' is 'Ata,' and 'younger brother' is 'No.' When people ask me about my family, they ask, 'Do you have siblings?' And I can say, 'Yes, I am 'Older Sister,'' and it -- immediately, I have to say I have a younger brother and a younger sister. I immediately situate myself in my family structure."
27,83,Gretchen,"If you say, 'Older Sister,' that means you're the oldest because that's what your siblings call you?"
27,84,Lauren,Yeah.
27,85,Gretchen,"If people say, 'Do you have brothers or sisters,' and I say, 'I have two siblings,' I think that immediately implies, 'Okay, they're different genders,' because if I had two sisters, I could just say I had two sisters."
27,86,Lauren,"It would be -- for an English speaker, you are giving an insufficient quantity of information by using 'sibling.'"
27,87,Gretchen,"Yeah, I was giving a less-informative answer than I could. My sister and I both say, 'Oh, yes, I have two siblings,' but my brother says, 'I have two sisters.' And this always surprises me because I think of myself as being one of 'siblings.' I don't think of myself as being one of 'sisters' because I have 'siblings.' I don't have 'sisters.' But, of course, you know, at some point, it breaks down."
27,88,Lauren,"Which brings us to some cultures focus on defining kin terms by gender. We do have a lot of terms in English. Your parents get distinguished by gender, your aunts and uncles, your grandparents. But not everyone does. 'Cousins' is a good example of that. 'Siblings' is a good example of that."
27,89,Gretchen,"Yeah, 'cousins' is especially interesting because English has this elaborate cousin system. And yet, for a lot of people, it's fairly obscure. They're aware of the terminology involved, but they don't actually know how to apply it."
27,90,Lauren,"I'm in contact with a fairly extended range of my family, and we all have just agreed at some point to just refer to each other as 'cousins.' If someone's really curious about why I have a 60-year-old cousin in Canada, I will talk them through the family structure. I can calculate out second-cousinses and once-removeds, but we just end up using 'cousins' because it's so much easier. We really aren't very good at calculating it."
27,91,Gretchen,"I mean, I have this very distinct memory for 'cousins,' which I don't have for other terms, of when I was about nine or ten. I had been seeing a bunch of one corner of the family tree, sitting down and calculating how all of the once-removeds and how all of the first-and-second-cousins-thing worked. When I did that, I memorised which of the people were which and which of the people weren't. I call them all 'cousins.' I'm not like, 'Hi, Second Cousin Bill,' because I don't think anyone really does that. But I can also be like, 'Oh, I have a cousin in Australia.' He's actually my first cousin once-removed because he's my mom's cousin. There's a removal of generations."
27,92,Lauren,Yeah.
27,93,Gretchen,"I've had to explain this system to adult, native English-speakers, who, in principle, you'd expect to know the kinship terms of our own language, but the 'cousins' system --"
27,94,Lauren,"And like, learning them at nine or ten is very late in language acquisition. A lot of kin terms we learn really early off. They're some of our first words."
27,95,Gretchen,"Especially for family terms, yeah. It's one thing to be learning the extended numbers system. Like, maybe you don't know what a 'quadrillion' is at age nine or ten, or you don't know some of the more technical vocabulary, or business jargon, or these corners of the lexicon. But kinship terms are very basic. They're often learned very early. This brings me to one of my favourite cross-linguistic studies, which is the one that finds that 'Mama' and 'Papa' are words that children use to address their mothers and fathers -- are some of the very, very first words across a whole bunch of languages that are completely unrelated."
27,96,Lauren,"Yeah, this is one of those it-seemed-so-obvious-when-I-first-learnt-it facts about language."
27,97,Gretchen,"Yeah, about 60 years ago, the American anthropologist G.P. Murdock did this survey of over 500 cultural groups around the world. He found that about half of societies use some sort of combination of /mə/, /mɛɪ/, /na/, /nɛɪ/, /noʊ/ to mean 'mother.' And another half, not necessarily the exact same societies, uses some combination of /pə/, /poʊ/, /ta/, or /toʊ/ to mean 'father.' So /mama/, /mɛɪmɛɪ/, /nana/, /nɛɪnɛɪ/, /papa/, /tata/ -- these kinds of things. He's like, 'This is a weird coincidence. Why?'"
27,98,Lauren,"Linguists get really caught up in historical linguistics, trying to use the relationship between lots of current languages to trace back to an older language. Some people thought maybe this relates to some fact of history. But Roman Jakobson had a completely different theory, and one that I find really compelling, which is that when you have an infant, and they're learning to use their mouth, they're gonna start with the sounds that are the easiest to make. The very easiest sounds to make are exactly those sounds that you mentioned in Murdock's paper."
27,99,Gretchen,"Especially, you know, /a/ is very easy. You can scream it. Many other sounds aren't very scream-able. Babies can scream it. And /ma/, /pa/ -- the sounds that involve your lips -- are very also easy to make -- very straightforward for the baby to learn to make. It doesn't involve as much control as using the tongue or further back in the throat. It's just a straightforward open-and-close thing. You're not trying to do bits of vibration, or bits of frication, or other types of more complicated things. And maybe the baby can see what their parents are doing -- you can see when someone else is using their lips. He figured it's kind of a property of babies, but it's also a property of parents thinking, 'I'm so important in my child's life. Clearly, this baby's saying my name.'"
27,100,Lauren,"It's a self-reinforcing fact across generations where parents are like, 'Oh' -- take what is essentially a child babbling and learning how to use their mouth as -- 'They're talking to me! They're saying my name!'"
27,101,Gretchen,'They're saying my name!' Which I think is also beautifully human of us in a very different sort of way.
27,102,Lauren,"Which is why even though we say the proper English names are 'Mother' and 'Father,' if you ask people what their children's first words were, you'll often get them to say, 'Oh, she said 'Mama,'' even though that's not what we think of as the normal English term. We accept very low standards from children in those regards."
27,103,Gretchen,"It's very charming. It's also interesting that 'Mama' and 'Papa' are a lot more common as first names than 'Amam' and 'Apap,' which are made out of the same sounds but putting a consonant and then a vowel is much --"
27,104,Lauren,Easier.
27,105,Gretchen,"Is much easier. And some languages don't let you begin words with vowels. But every language will let you begin a word with a consonant and end it with a vowel. Or some languages won't let you end a word with a consonant. But consonant-vowel is a good basic syllable in every language. /ma/ is a better word than /am/, and /pa /is a better word than /ap/ for babies to learn and for languages to produce. You don't get 'Apap' and 'Amam.' You get 'Mama' and 'Papa.'"
27,106,Lauren,"I'm gonna go from talking about some of the most primary and parentally instinctual vocabulary about kinship to sharing some really cool stuff in Australian languages, because one thing I find really interesting is when you have a culture that, over time, manages to create these incredibly elaborate and complex kinship systems -- I think, in some ways, our inability to process our word for 'cousins' is potentially a bit of a chicken-and-egg thing, right? We don't use these terms very much because we don't really talk about or track our extended families very often in our culture."
27,107,Gretchen,"Right, but in cultures where people are less likely to move to cities, and are more likely to have larger families, and continue living in the same villages with or areas with a lot of extended family around, it's useful to distinguish between all these different kinds of relationships. Especially to prevent people from having kids with people who are too closely related to them, which is, you know, useful for the continuation of the human species and shows up in different cultures a lot."
27,108,Lauren,"When you have cultures that have been together, living in close-knit, complex societies for generations and generations, you can get some really cool kinship stuff. And Australian languages seem particularly well-disposed to this. One thing that's really nifty is people calculate 'harmonic generations.' This is where -- to use your family as an example of what a harmonic generation is -- in some ways, your lineage of GG's is an example of harmonic generations, where grandparent and grandchildren are treated with the same kin term or treated as being part of a cohort together."
27,109,Gretchen,"Oh, that's interesting. I mean, I guess it's kind of the case in English in the sense that they both get the prefix 'grand.' Whereas, you don't have that for parent/child, mother/father, daughter/son. They don't have the prefix. Whereas, grandchild/grandparent have a symmetrical prefix."
27,110,Lauren,"So in the Waanyi language, the term for 'grandparent' can actually be used reciprocally to refer to a grandchild as well. There's a really nice paper on that that I'll link to in the show notes. Another really interesting thing is all of the relationships we've been talking about so far have been about my relationship with another person or your relationship with another person. And a lot of kin terms, you start with the individual in the centre of the diagram, and you're like -- 'my aunt' is about my relationship with this person. Or 'my grandparent,' or 'my grandchild,' is about my specific relationship with a specific individual. And then -- my grandparent is not your grandparent because we are not related to each other."
27,111,Gretchen,That is true.
27,112,Lauren,"Whereas, tri-relational kin terms are terms that encode three different relationships. There are reasons why these come into being, but I'll give you an example of one first."
27,113,Gretchen,"Okay, I can't even visualise this right now."
27,114,Lauren,"Well, the good thing is there is a visualisation. There'll be a link to this article by Joe Blythe. In Murrinhpatha, there is a term that is used by a male speaker when talking to their son or daughter about the son or daughter's grandmother on the other side of the family."
27,115,Gretchen,"Okay, okay."
27,116,Lauren,It's not saying -- it's not a word for 'my mother-in-law.' And it's not a word for 'your grandmother.' It's a word that specifically means --
27,117,Gretchen,'Your opposite-side grandmother.'
27,118,Lauren,'Your opposite-side grandmother.'
27,119,Gretchen,'Your grandmother who is not my mother.'
27,120,Lauren,Yes.
27,121,Gretchen,And is it a prefix that's used for any of the relatives on that side?
27,122,Lauren,"No, there are entirely different forms depending on different relationships -- for your son or daughter's maternal grandparent on the other side of the family. And the reason that tri-relational kin terms like this one evolve is because there are taboos within the culture on men being able to speak to or about their mother-in-law."
27,123,Gretchen,Okay.
27,124,Lauren,That explains that one. But there are other tri-relational kin terms that don't have to do with these taboos. It's just about triangulating everyone in the relationship.
27,125,Gretchen,"I guess that makes sense in the sense that -- so when I'm talking to, especially, younger relatives, like ones that are little kids, I might refer to my own mother as 'Aunt Whatever' if I'm talking to my young cousin because I know that if this kid is two or something, they don't quite understand how all of the complex kinship terms work. So I'm gonna use the one that places myself in their position."
27,126,Lauren,Yes.
27,127,Gretchen,"Or especially, if you see a young child, and you're like, 'Where's Mummy,' you don't mean where's your own mum, you mean where's the child's mum."
27,128,Lauren,"Yeah, so we can do these triangulations. We just do them in our own head and position ourselves like the other person."
27,129,Gretchen,Right. And we don't have an additional set of vocabulary for it.
27,130,Lauren,This is an entirely separate set of vocabulary to help navigate the three-way relationship.
27,131,Gretchen,"Yeah, that's really interesting."
27,132,Lauren,It's super interesting.
27,133,Gretchen,"I can definitely see why that would be useful in certain circumstances, especially if you have a complex network of kin."
27,134,Lauren,"There are complex words that are encoded into the language that aren't encoded into ours, but there are also examples in Australian languages where these things get encoded into the grammar as well. In Kayardild there is -- coming back to this harmonic-generations thing. I will use a different pronoun if I'm talking about me and someone in my own generation, or me and my grandparent, compared to me and my father, or my child, because the father or child are not -- they're disharmonic generations. Whereas, my siblings and my grandparents and my grandchildren are my harmonic generations. So there are entirely different pronoun forms depending on whether I'm referring to a group of people in my harmonic generations or non-harmonic generations. There's a whole paper on this that I really love from Nick Evans back in 2003 that I'll link to. The thing I really love about it is that Evans refers to this kind of phenomenon as 'kintax.'"
27,135,Gretchen,"'Kintax?' Oh, that's really good!"
27,136,Lauren,Where the kinship system is so ingrained into the language that it becomes part of the grammar.
27,137,Gretchen,The kinship system is in the syntax. It's 'kintax.'
27,138,Lauren,Yeah.
27,139,Gretchen,That actually -- it sounds like a kind of tax that -- a fee that you impose upon your family a little bit.
27,140,Lauren,Only if you're not thinking of it with your linguist brain.
27,141,Gretchen,"Only if you're not thinking with your linguist brain. 'Kintax.' That's really good. Another linguistic system that I find really interesting that encodes family relationships in a different sort of way is the situation in Icelandic. Icelandic speakers will have names like -- you might get, like, 'Leif Erikson,' who is the son of Erik the Red, which a famous Viking. And then --"
27,142,Lauren,"Oh, yeah, 'Erik's son.' Sorry, just have to point out the obvious."
27,143,Gretchen,"Who's, literally, 'the son of Erik,' yeah. But then Leif's son doesn't become something-something-also-Erikson. He becomes, I don't know, like, 'Sven Leifson.' This system is vaguely familiar to English speakers because we have names like 'Davidson,' and 'Peterson,' and 'Johnson,' and stuff like that that have the 'son' in them. But they're no longer active."
27,144,Lauren,"There was a recent History of English podcast episode where Kevin Stroud looks at how this changes in the Middle English period. We did have -- you would be 'Christopher Robertson.' And then, you'd have 'William Christopherson,' who would then be having children who were like, 'Thomas Williamson.' But then, eventually, those names froze. The whole idea of surnames is really central to English and really weird to Icelandic people."
27,145,Gretchen,"Yeah, whereas in Icelandic, all of these get created. You also have the equivalence of, you know, like, 'Leif's daughter.' She's not gonna get the last name 'Leifson.' She's gonna be 'Leifsdottir.'"
27,146,Lauren,Yeah.
27,147,Gretchen,"And in Icelandic, when you refer to someone, you know what their father's name is, or sometimes their mother's name -- if they get named after their mother. They don't have the custom of referring to people by their surname in formal contexts. Political leaders or dignitaries in Iceland -- the correct formal way to refer to them is by their first name because the only context in which you would use 'So-and-So's son,' or 'So-and-So's daughter' is when you're saying the full name, not as a replacement for their name."
27,148,Lauren,"I love that everyone's been on a name bender at the moment because, obviously, with an imminent human to name so have I. But there's also a great Allusionist episode recently where Helen Zaltzman chats to some people in Iceland about their naming conventions and about the way that surnames aren't static, but they change with each generation."
27,149,Gretchen,"Yeah, and I found the Iceland thing really interesting because I realised that in the context where I'm figuring out who all my second cousin once-removeds are, I also generally know, when I'm introducing myself in a family reunion context, which of my family members I need to name in order for the person I'm talking to and I to figure out how we're supposed to know each other."
27,150,Lauren,Yeah.
27,151,Gretchen,I don't have this encoded in my name anywhere except for the fact that I happen to be named after my grandmother. But like -- it's part of conversation even in a more limited context.
27,152,Lauren,"Yeah, going to family reunions or weddings, and then, I'm Lauren, 'Chris's daughter.'"
27,153,Gretchen,"Yeah, exactly. Or like, 'Who are you here for in this wedding?' Like, 'Which side of the wedding are you here for?' Even if you're not a relative, you can be like, 'Well, I'm So-and-So's friend from university.'"
27,154,Lauren,"Yeah, that's putting you in the extended non-kinship group."
27,155,Gretchen,"Yeah, or like, at academic conferences, you're like, 'Oh, well, I'm So-and-So's advisee.' And they're like, 'Oh, I know So-and-So.' Or like, the kind of extended networks."
27,156,Lauren,Humans have this need to triangulate where they sit within social relationships.
27,157,Gretchen,"Yeah, absolutely. It's also interesting -- I was intrigued to learn when researching this episode that the word 'sibling' in English is both fairly new and also very old."
27,158,Lauren,"Hm, new in terms of its current use?"
27,159,Gretchen,"Yeah, so it comes from Old English. 'Sib' is actually related to the word for 'self.' But in Old English, 'sibling' is just any family member. And then, in the early 1900s -- 1903 -- geneticists started talking about inheritance, and they were like, 'Guys, it's getting really annoying to keep saying 'brothers and/or sisters' this whole time. It'd be really great if we had a gender-neutral term for this umbrella category because inheritance doesn't care.' And so they reached into Old English and pulled out this term that had meant 'any relative' and started using it to mean 'brother and/or sister.'"
27,160,Lauren,Useful.
27,161,Gretchen,"I was like, 'This seems like a totally unremarkable word for me. It's totally part of my active vocabulary. I didn't acquire it when I was ten, like third cousin once-removed.' And yet, it's a surprisingly recent innovation."
27,162,Lauren,"I didn't realise it was that recent. But one recent-ish innovation that I've enjoyed bringing into my vocabulary is a word on analogy, which is, instead of saying 'nieces and nephews' all the time, saying 'niblings.'"
27,163,Gretchen,That's fantastic. I like 'niblings' a lot.
27,164,Lauren,"Which has the double benefit of being cute. It was first used in a 1951 article by a linguist who was talking about kinship terms across languages and was like, 'Look, a gender neutral-term like 'sibling' is really handy, so I'm just gonna coin 'nibling' while we're at it.'"
27,165,Gretchen,"That's great. I've also been seeing some people who are non-binary or gender queer trying to come up with terms for like, 'Oh, well, one of my siblings is having a child. I want that kid to call me something, but I don't want to be called 'Aunt' or 'Uncle' What other term can I come up with here?' I've seen a couple examples. I don't think there's one 'nibling' go-to yet, but there's a bunch of options like 'pibling,' 'parent-sibling.'"
27,166,Lauren,"Oh, I like 'pibling.'"
27,167,Gretchen,"It's kind of cute. It works very well in analogy or portmanteaus like 'Auntle' or 'Ancle.' I've seen 'Unty,' which is like 'Uncle' and 'Aunty.' Or 'Titi,' which is, I think, based on the Spanish -- 'Tio' and 'Tia' are used for 'Uncle' and 'Aunt,' respectively. 'Titi' is combining those. Or 'Zizi,' similarly, for 'Zio' and 'Zia,' which is the Italian equivalent."
27,168,Lauren,"And we've seen lots of examples of individual families innovating terms. I feel like if the system isn't working for you within kinship, making it work for you and your family, however it's structured, is a great idea."
27,169,Gretchen,"Yeah, I think it's very easy to make it to catch on in an individual family because if you tell a kid, 'Here's what to call me,' the kid doesn't know any different. It works great for grandparents, and I think it should work really well for other family members as well. It'll be interesting to keep following that, because maybe in another generation or two, people will be like, 'What do you mean 'pibling' was only invented in the 2000's? It's clearly part of my active vocabulary. You mean 'nibling,' and 'pibling,' and 'sibling,' were all once innovative?' Which I think is a really interesting corner of the lexicon. [Music]"

27,173,Lauren,Stay lingthusiastic!
28,1,Lauren,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics! I'm Lauren Gawne, and today I'm talking to Hannah Gibson about Swahili, Bantu languages, and nouns![Music]"
28,2,Lauren,"Hannah, welcome to Lingthusiasm! We're very happy to have another fellow enthusiastic linguist on the show today. I was wondering if you could introduce yourself and what your current role is."
28,3,Hannah,"Yeah, my name's Hannah Gibson. And I'm currently a lecturer at the University of Essex in the UK."
28,4,Lauren,Excellent. How did you get into linguistics?
28,5,Hannah,"Ah. Reluctantly, perhaps. I've always loved languages, loved learning languages. I had friends who spoke different languages at school, and I loved learning the odd word here or there, or phrases and things. At school I learned a bit of German and a bit of Spanish. Then I went to university. I went to SOAS, School of Oriental and African Studies, in London. I got there, and I was supposed to be studying law."
28,6,Lauren,Okay.
28,7,Hannah,"I got there, and I found out that you could study -- I think the list was, like, 43 different languages from around the world."
28,8,Lauren,Yeah.
28,9,Hannah,"I was amazed. And I thought, 'I can't be here and not study one of these languages.' So I changed my studies a little bit to study Swahili and law. I had this list of languages and thought, 'Oh, which language do I want to study?' And so I studied Swahili and law really thinking, 'Oh, I'm interested in languages, learning languages, but I'm not interested in linguistics,' because I didn't really know, perhaps, what linguistics was."
28,10,Lauren,It is one of the biggest problems that people don't actually know what linguistics is.
28,11,Hannah,"I thought, 'Oh, I like learning languages and I like talking to people, but this linguistics thing, not so sure about that.' Anyway, the more I studied Swahili in that case and the more I learnt about languages, I did an Introduction to Linguistics course, and I thought, 'Oh, okay, this is absolutely fantastic.' Then I moved to linguistics --"
28,12,Lauren,Yay!
28,13,Hannah,-- and I've never looked back.
28,14,Lauren,We're very happy to have you. I'm not going to ask you any questions about law.
28,15,Hannah,Thank you.
28,16,Lauren,"But for those who aren't familiar with the Swahili language, can you tell us a bit about where it's generally spoken and other fun Swahili facts?"
28,17,Hannah,"Oh, absolutely. Swahili is a language spoken across east Africa. The homeland or traditional area where Swahili was spoken was along the coast of present-day Tanzania and Kenya and also onto some of the islands. You might have heard of places like Zanzibar. That's, again, off the Tanzanian coast. But Swahili is also now, and has been for a long time, used as a lingua franca throughout east Africa. You'll find it spoken in, like, Uganda, Democratic Republic of the Congo, parts of northern Mozambique, and southern Somalia, Burundi. So it's got a huge geographic coverage, but that east Africa area..."
28,18,Lauren,Cool. We'll make sure we link at least to the Wikipedia article and a good map.
28,19,Hannah,Absolutely.
28,20,Lauren,And the domain of it.
28,21,Hannah,And across the global diaspora as well. But that's sort of its heart.
28,22,Lauren,So you studied that all the way through your undergraduate career?
28,23,Hannah,"Yes, and I spent a year in east Africa studying at a university in Zanzibar, in that case, in Tanzania. So one semester in Kenya and one semester in Tanzania just focusing on Swahili. That was where I really -- my eyes were opened to language and linguistics. And I just thought, 'Yeah, I want to do this for as long as I possibly can.'"
28,24,Lauren,Awesome.
28,25,Hannah,I just then took more and more linguistics classes after that.
28,26,Lauren,So you took more linguistics after that. And then you ended up going into a masters?
28,27,Hannah,A Masters in Linguistics at SOAS as well.
28,28,Lauren,Okay. And then a PhD?
28,29,Hannah,In linguistics. Also at SOAS.
28,30,Lauren,"I mean, if you're on to a good thing."
28,31,Hannah,"Absolutely. I think for me I'm interested in languages from east Africa, African languages. SOAS was a great place to do that. Expertise was all around me. And I think, because I'd studied law as an undergraduate, it actually felt like quite a change because it was completely different teachers. It was a different department. It wasn't like, 'Oh, I'm still here.' By the time I got to a PhD, it was a little bit like that. But, yes, it was a great place to do that."
28,32,Lauren,"I don't think it's as common in North America, but I did my undergrad and postgraduate studies at the same university."
28,33,Hannah,"There you go. If you want to study Swahili and law, actually SOAS is the only place I know in the UK that you can do it. So beyond that."
28,34,Lauren,"Yeah, there's not a lot of places. So there's obviously a bit of a transition there from learning about -- I think you obviously got into linguistics because you were interested in Swahili. What was the difference between learning Swahili as a language learner and studying -- like, is your work focused on Swahili, or do you look at other languages?"
28,35,Hannah,"Yeah, it's a really good question. I suppose it was quite a transition. The last few years, most of my work -- my PhD was on a different language, not on Swahili. It was on a language called Rangi, or Langi, spoken in Tanzania. We can talk more about that. But that was when I first sort of came with more of a linguistic approach because, rather than -- although I did learn a bit of the language, I was thinking of it as a, 'How do I learn about this, and do research, and things?' I think it's about, perhaps, building short cuts. If you're learning a language, you're just thinking of it in isolation. What are these words and how do I make a sentence?"
28,36,Lauren,Yeah.
28,37,Hannah,"And then with linguistics you're looking for short cuts and common patterns because you're like, 'Oh, well, I know what grammatical gender is.' Like, 'Oh, I can now work that across whatever language you put in front of me.' It's making those connections, some of which are language-specific. And that's really interesting. But I'm also interested in then -- obviously, as linguists we're interested in what is common across languages. What you can do. What you can't do. Maybe bigger questions."
28,38,Lauren,"I always think of it as the difference between learning to play football and learning to be a good football coach. The difference between you being able to kick the ball really well -- and, like, I'm a terrible sports player, so I feel like this analogy works for me because --"
28,39,Hannah,You don't know what it involves?
28,40,Lauren,"It works as an analogy for me because I'm very unrealistic about it. You can invest a lot of effort in learning, yourself, how to play the game really well, but you can only ever really learn a couple of codes of football, right? But, if you learn how to read a group of people and how they move and what the rules are, there's more chance that you could potentially become really observant about how rugby works. And, again, this is a terrible analogy because I'm not interested in rugby or football but..."
28,41,Hannah,I feel like you've thought this analogy through.
28,42,Lauren,"This is my go-to analogy. So, moving from being a player of Swahili to figuring out the rules of the Bantu language family, Swahili is part of the Bantu family?"
28,43,Hannah,"Yeah, exactly. The Bantu languages are a group of something like 350 to 600 languages, depending on how you define a language or where you draw a boundary."
28,44,Lauren,"That's a pretty good-sized family of languages. About the size of Indo-European, I guess, which is the family English is in. It's about 400 or 500."
28,45,Hannah,"There you go. It's a massive language family. That group of languages are spoken -- I generally just say in sub-Saharan Africa -- but, basically, from Cameroon eastwards and southwards with pockets of other languages that aren't Bantu languages in those regions as well. But in lots of sub-Saharan Africa you'll find Bantu languages."
28,46,Lauren,"Just to zoom out a little bit for people who aren't familiar with the incredible linguistic diversity of Africa, because I think -- you know, in Australia we have between 150 and 300 languages, depending on how you count. But they're all either part of one big Pama-Nyungan family, or not. And so we don't often -- and, you know, all of Europe is pretty much Indo-European, except for a few languages. It's hard to comprehend just how much diversity there is in the African continent."
28,47,Hannah,Absolutely. I think estimates put the number of languages in Africa somewhere around 2000.
28,48,Lauren,Okay.
28,49,Hannah,"I don't know what your numbers for the number of languages in the world are, but I think --"
28,50,Lauren,What do you say?
28,51,Hannah,I've heard 7000.
28,52,Lauren,Yeah.
28,53,Hannah,"So, if you take 2000 of those being in Africa, that's a massive proportion. It's not quite a quarter, but it's a lot. Say you have something like 2000 or more languages in Africa. Those are then broken down into four language families, broadly. That's been the tradition anyway. You have four language families. And then the Bantu languages are part of one of those families, the Niger-Congo group. But, even if you put the higher end of the numbers of Bantu languages at 600, as you can see, of those 2000, you've still got lots of other languages. So, yeah, really high levels of linguistic diversity. Quite high levels of bilingualism and multilingualism across the African continent as well. In Tanzania, where I do much of my research, that's one country and it has 120 languages recognised, you know, identified languages. So, yeah, it's, like, a lot of linguistic diversity."
28,54,Lauren,And Rangi is also part of the Bantu language family?
28,55,Hannah,"Absolutely. Rangi is a Bantu language spoken in central Tanzania. I started working on Rangi because I'm interested in, amongst other things, language contact."
28,56,Lauren,Right.
28,57,Hannah,"So Rangi is a Bantu language. It's spoken in this area of central Tanzania, basically the bottom of the Rift Valley, if people have some kind of idea of the Rift Valley."
28,58,Lauren,That sounds very -- what is the Rift Valley?
28,59,Hannah,"Oh, gosh. It is a valley that goes from, I suppose, that part of Tanzania northwards. That's how I think of it. It's, like, physically a rift. I suppose to do with tectonic plates and things. But I'm definitely out of my depth if I'm talking about those kinds of things."
28,60,Lauren,We're not a podcast that's enthusiastic about geology. That's fine.
28,61,Hannah,There you go. But Rangi's interesting because -- for lots of reasons -- but it is completely surrounded by speakers of non-Bantu languages.
28,62,Lauren,Okay.
28,63,Hannah,"I was interested in whether some of the grammar of Rangi, the features that you'd find in Rangi, would be the result of contact with non-Bantu languages."
28,64,Lauren,Right.
28,65,Hannah,"We can talk more about that. But one of the things is whether languages that are similar to each other have different influences when they're in contact than languages that are very different. In the case of Rangi, it's like, I don't know, Spanish being in contact with Japanese or something like that. It's really unrelated, completely different language families in one geographic area. And what happens then?"
28,66,Lauren,"One thing I'm really interested in with language contact is sometimes it makes languages move more similar because they're all hanging out as like, 'Well, I do this in this language and it's handy, so I'm going to do it in the other language too.' And then sometimes they pull apart because it's like, 'Well, I want to be different.'"
28,67,Hannah,"Absolutely. I mean, one of the nice things about working on -- just to step back -- the Bantu languages is that you have a large language family with some really quite big, broad similarities, typological similarities. There are common things in lots of them, but then really small microvariations. You could say, 'Oh, well, this is the general word order, but look at this tiny change between the languages.'"
28,68,Lauren,These guys over here have to be different.
28,69,Hannah,They do. They do it different. One of the things that's interesting about the area of central Tanzania where I work is you have the four language families that I mentioned in the beginning that are found in Africa -- Tanzania is the only place where you find all four. It's almost like the meeting point of those really different languages.
28,70,Lauren,Yeah.
28,71,Hannah,"The question there is, if you're a Rangi speaker and you're surrounded by different types of languages, whether the language has changed to reflect that. And then the sociolinguistic stuff. When you talk about the nature of the contact, there are families where the people speak different languages. Their parents speak two different languages. Their children perhaps speak one of them or two of them. There's a long, sustained history of what we would call 'language contact,' people moving around, trading with each other, living next door in the same village, or whatever. Quite often, there are slightly imbalanced power relations. They tend to learn one of the languages, but those people don't also learn the other one. You have some people who speak several of those languages, but not -- you know, if you speak the dominant language you don't learn the other ones as well."
28,72,Lauren,"I guess it's worth stressing that the situation is incredibly interesting and there's such diversity in Tanzania, but sustained contact between very diverse languages and long-term, small-community multilingualism is kind of -- globally, we see it again and again, and it's totally sustainable."
28,73,Hannah,Absolutely.
28,74,Lauren,"I think sometimes, especially if you're an English speaker who grew up in the UK or Australia, you're so used to this stable monolingualism with a few people speaking their own languages at home. It's really worth stressing that we're the weird ones."
28,75,Hannah,"Absolutely. And, you know, we're talking about linguistic diversity of Africa but, I mean, around the world people speak different languages. They shift to other languages when they move, if they need work. There's all sorts of, really, just practical considerations. You move to a new area, you need to talk to people, and feed yourself, and those kinds of things."
28,76,Lauren,"Do you work across all the grammar, or are you interested in particular grammatical phenomena?"
28,77,Hannah,"Oh, that's an excellent question. For the research that I did on Rangi for my PhD, there were a couple of descriptions before that other people had done. Well, one woman had done a PhD -- two people had done PhDs before, but I essentially also did a description, which meant that I had to know a little bit about everything because I went in not knowing anything. But I was looking at a particular feature, which is what led me to think it had something to do with language contact, which is a particular word order which is unusual in Rangi. There is a construction in which you find the verb before the auxiliary."
28,78,Lauren,Okay.
28,79,Hannah,"It is a language which has the same kind of word order as English: the subject, the verb, and the object. The Bantu languages in general, you would expect to say, you know, 'I eat apples.'"
28,80,Lauren,'Eat' is my go-to transitive verb.
28,81,Hannah,"There you go. I prefer it to 'hit,' which is the one that linguists tend to use."
28,82,Lauren,I think I'm just hungrier and less violent.
28,83,Hannah,"There you go. Exactly. So, you know, 'I eat apples,' or, for example, 'I will eat apples.' And essentially, in Rangi, if you're ever talking about things in the future, so the future tense, you say, 'to eat, I will.' That is cross-linguistically very unusual because the prediction is that, if you have a language with subject-verb-object order, 'I eat apples,' or, 'I will eat apples,' or something like that, you would always expect that 'will' to come before 'eat.' In English, but also cross-linguistically, it's a very strong generalisation based on a pattern based on the prediction that you will find that order. In Rangi, it's the other way around, but only in the future tense."
28,84,Lauren,Right.
28,85,Hannah,"So that was my starting point. And, because it was in contact with languages with different word orders, really different structures, I thought, 'Oh, well, this is obviously something to do with language contact. How interesting!' I had to do lots of descriptive work and documentation work to start with, but that was what I started looking at. I think in the PhD I didn't really end up talking about language contact because I really got very excited about this auxiliary verb order and the context in which you could have it and couldn't have it."
28,86,Lauren,"That shows that, once you eventually got to linguistics, you were definitely not reluctant anymore."
28,87,Hannah,No.
28,88,Lauren,"When you say, 'I spent four years getting really excited about auxiliary order,' that's when you're like --"
28,89,Hannah,"And several years later I'm still excited about auxiliaries, can't you tell?"
28,90,Lauren,Excellent.
28,91,Hannah,"So that was my focus. And then, actually, I found -- we thought Rangi was one of the very few Bantu languages that had this order, and then I found another language that's spoken about 60 kilometres away -- so to talk about high levels of linguistic diversity in a small area -- that also has that order. I've since found four languages, which are spoken up near Lake Victoria. That's now much, much further away. But, if you say there are -- even if you put the estimate at the low end, say 350 Bantu languages, there seem to be six that allow verb-auxiliary order."
28,92,Lauren,Okay.
28,93,Hannah,"I'm still interested in why. Why those languages and what's different about them? It still may be that this contact angle plays a role in that. If you speak two languages and they have different word orders, allow different word orders, then that doesn't seem so strange to you to say, 'to eat, I will,' right? Because perhaps your first language or the other languages you speak allow that, and then it becomes a natural part of the standard way of speaking."
28,94,Lauren,"Nepali, which I use for day-to-day in Nepal, and the Tibetan languages that I work with, those languages have subject-object-verb, so, 'I apples eat.' And now when I learn a new language, even if it's subject-verb-object like English -- and I know that's weird, my brain is comfortable with a word order that I really struggled with to begin with."
28,95,Hannah,"Verb-final is now your, you know..."
28,96,Lauren,Verb-final is great. It's the best.
28,97,Hannah,"Absolutely. You know, imagine that over generations or your whole community also speaking Yolmo as well as English and any other languages you learned along the way."
28,98,Lauren,"Yeah, awesome. Like, the only thing I know about Bantu languages, and it's from the fact -- so we worked at SOAS at the same time. That's how we know each other. One thing that I know about Bantu languages is that they do cool stuff with nouns."
28,99,Hannah,"Yes, they do."
28,100,Lauren,And I love nouns.
28,101,Hannah,Ah!
28,102,Lauren,So can we talk about nouns?
28,103,Hannah,"Yes, please! They do lots of cool things with nouns. But the most striking thing, I suppose, and the thing that I always give as an example when people say, like, 'Oh, what's unusual' or 'What's the striking thing about the Bantu languages, about Swahili,' is that they have a system of what have traditionally, in linguistics, been called noun classes. They are like grammatical gender, if you're familiar with French with masculine/feminine, or German masculine/feminine/neuter, you have two genders, three genders. Swahili, for example, has 16."
28,104,Lauren,"Okay, that is -- like, I'm not good at math -- but slightly more than three."
28,105,Hannah,"Yes, yeah. Actually, the gender system doesn't make any sex-based distinctions. There's no, you know, man and woman, or boy and girl, like, grammatically. The nouns are categorised in other ways."
28,106,Lauren,Okay.
28,107,Hannah,"One of the really prominent features across the grammar of Bantu languages, actually, is the distinction between things that are alive and that are not alive, so animate and inanimate, or sometimes, more specifically, human and not human, let me just use the terminology, like noun classes. And then they tend to be numbered because you can't get away with masculine/feminine once you get up to -- and, in fact, Luganda, a Bantu language spoken in Uganda, has, I think, 21 noun classes. When you get up to that, you're just like, 'Well, let's just number them because we can't' -- you know, masculine/feminine/neuter, you've sort of run out. You would find, for example, Class 1 would be humans, but singular."
28,108,Lauren,That's a very humanist approach.
28,109,Hannah,"Exactly. We think that the most important are, like, humans, or 'person,' the word for person, the word 'teacher,' the word for 'child.' And then what's conventionally numbered Class 2 is the plural of that."
28,110,Lauren,Okay.
28,111,Hannah,"So 'teacher' and then 'teachers.' 'Child -- children.' 'Farmer -- farmers.' You can almost, to start with, think that, 'Well, actually, I can cut those in half because most things in the lower numbers have singular and plural counterparts.' That's probably true up until about class ten because after that you end up with things that don't make a singular/plural distinction. But, to start with, for example, on the basis of Swahili, you have humans. Class 3 and 4 are things like, I don't know, 'mountain,' 'river,' 'moon,' maybe natural phenomena."
28,112,Lauren,Okay.
28,113,Hannah,"'Tree,' 'plant.'"
28,114,Lauren,Yeah.
28,115,Hannah,"Things like that. If you're learning this language, these are the things you learn sort of like, 'Oh, okay, well, those are broad categories.' And then, of course, you find something that doesn't seem, to you at least, to make any sense to be in that category."
28,116,Lauren,"But, I mean, people often talk about this with the French/German gender-based stuff. They're like, 'Well, why are these inanimate objects arbitrarily gendered? And why is' -- like, the 'uterus' is masculine in French."
28,117,Hannah,"Oh, interesting."
28,118,Lauren,I don't speak French.
28,119,Hannah,"Yeah, me neither."
28,120,Lauren,It's just my random fact.
28,121,Hannah,It's a good go-to example.
28,122,Lauren,"You know, these things are mostly semantically coherent, but actually language is a fun system and does all kinds of wacky hacks."
28,123,Hannah,"Those are quite systematic, so you could think 'Oh, a natural phenomenon' or whatever. And then the next ones are things that often go in pairs or part-whole relations like fruits, and trees, and things like that. But then you get to things that are, what we would say, 'phonologically determined.' They have a particular sound. One class is things that begin with 'ki-', and then its plural is 'vi-'."
28,124,Lauren,We're really scrambling for sense here.
28,125,Hannah,"It's like, 'Okay, so, ki-things and vi-things.' But, again, those things are most commonly inanimate because your human and animal things are going to be in a different class. Things that begin with 'ki-' and 'vi-', nouns that begin with nasals, /n/, and /ɲ/, and /ŋ/ go in another class as well. And then you end up with a class which doesn't have singular/plural distinction for abstract nouns, so, 'happiness,' 'love,' 'freedom,' things like that. And then another, I think, really nice feature of Bantu languages is that many of them have different noun classes for locations. You have a general location, often a specific location, and an internal location. Those are also different noun classes, like different grammatical genders if you want to look at it like that. That's the nouns. But then, if you think about how a language works, that then spreads across everything. 'My book,' you know, the word for 'my' is going to be affected by which class 'book' is in."
28,126,Lauren,Right.
28,127,Hannah,"In this case, 'book' is one of the 'ki-' examples."
28,128,Lauren,Excellent. My favourite category.
28,129,Hannah,"It's 'kitabu.' And then you say 'changu,' so, 'kitabu changu,' 'book my' literally, 'my book.' Whereas, if you're talking about your teacher, 'teacher' is human/animate so it's 'mwalimu,' and then it's 'mwangu,' not just the noun changes, has a different prefix, but then the thing that agrees, the possessive, the 'my,' also changes. It would be the same for numbers, so for counting, any adjectives 'big/small,' possession, 'of,' and on verbs too."
28,130,Lauren,A lot for a new learner to get their head around.
28,131,Hannah,Absolutely.
28,132,Lauren,"But the kids do it completely fine, I'm sure."
28,133,Hannah,"Absolutely. You can also use it in fun and sort of -- you know, there's layers. You can put things in different noun classes for pejorative meanings, or to change meanings, and things. I think you'd like this example. The word for 'bird' is 'ndege.' If you think a bird is alive, you would make the appropriate agreement for Class 1, let's say, because it's something that's alive. But an aeroplane is also the same word, 'ndege,' but it's not alive, right? So its agreement would be in Class 9 because it's not alive. It's the same word. You can sort of move things around."
28,134,Lauren,"And so I guess this is how you can create new words. Like, when aeroplanes were invented, instead of doing what we did and cobbling together some existing English and French and whatever, you can take an existing word and put it in another noun class?"
28,135,Hannah,"Absolutely. You can shift things into different classes. They can then mean different things or have subtle different social meanings. You can cobble together two words and make a new word for something, like 'telescope' or something because it's something that 'sees far away,' or things like 'telescope.' But, yeah, absolutely. You have a different set of things at your disposal."
28,136,Lauren,Fabulous. You were talking about the noun classes for Swahili?
28,137,Hannah,Yes.
28,138,Lauren,Are they similar across all the languages? 'All the languages.' You've looked at all 600. Right. Yeah. Obviously.
28,139,Hannah,"That's a really interesting question. People have made a distinction between Bantu languages which have what would be described as a 'canonical' noun class system, which means that they usually have six noun classes or upwards. Swahili, let's say, has 16 and Luganda, at the higher level, has 21. You tend to find similar patterns, animate things, sometimes a specific class for humans, tools, objects, long things, you know, trees, things that are not human but are natural phenomena, or alive, or whatever. But then at the other end of spectrum, you end up with languages, often in the northwest of the Bantu area, sort of around Cameroon, Gabon, with a really, what we would think of as a 'reduced' system of noun classes, many less than six, maybe, you know, a handful. The reason that people would describe those as 'reduced' is that the idea that, historically, the Bantu languages -- like, the predecessor of Bantu languages or what they all came from -- did have this high number of noun classes. That was one of the unifying features of the Bantu languages. The ones that are in Cameroon or that area, which is where the Bantu languages are supposed to have originated, then, those systems have sort of eroded over time and fallen away. We would describe that as a 'reduced' system, not in any sense that it's, you know..."
28,140,Lauren,We're not picking on those.
28,141,Hannah,"Yeah, but that the suggestion is that at some point they had more, and they've lost them. You can see why you may lose them. But, interestingly, even languages that have lost them, that animate and inanimate distinction is often one of the ones that remains."
28,142,Lauren,Okay. It's really strong.
28,143,Hannah,It's really important whether something's human or if it's a chair.
28,144,Lauren,"Languages do this with all kinds -- we see this all the time with different parts of the grammar that languages will have something in this very elaborate system, and then it will fall away. Like, English used to have this gendered case marking the way that German does. And we don't have it anymore because the language changed. We moved away from that. This cycle of things reducing, or growing, or whatever, is a completely normal part of language."
28,145,Hannah,Absolutely. Yeah.
28,146,Lauren,It makes it fun to see how languages change in different contexts.
28,147,Hannah,"Yeah, one of the things that's nice about working on the Bantu language family is that lots of -- there are written descriptions of some of these languages from, I don't know, over a hundred years ago or things, but there's often not long written records. You don't find examples of writing, with the exception, actually, of Swahili and then maybe Kikongo and a few other languages. But we can basically trace a lot of the history of movements of those people in these parts of Africa through looking at the languages. You can see what languages are similar in terms of similar vocabulary and words, and then reconstruct where these people may have moved from, and what time they moved, and things like that. Language really can help us piece together parts of history that we may otherwise -- yeah, they can be a part of the story, basically."
28,148,Lauren,"Yeah. So Rangi is a smaller language, but Swahili is one of the largest languages in Africa?"
28,149,Hannah,"Yeah, I think in terms of -- people say it's one of the most widely-spoken languages because of it having this massive geographic coverage across eastern Africa. I think speaker numbers, really, the estimates vary. I've heard up to 120 million, which sounds massive -- 60 million."
28,150,Lauren,"But is that in the way that I, like, speak, you know, I speak Italian in that I can navigate an Italian menu. Is that the kind of -- because it's a lingua franca, the quality, not to put a label on it, but the..."
28,151,Hannah,"I mean, I think probably -- I don't really know. But let's say, like, 60 or 90 million or something. I think actually lots of those people are really very competent speakers who use it regularly for important purposes in their life. Tanzania, interestingly, was the only country in Africa that declared an African language its official language at independence, rather than a former colonial language. Tanzania's primary education is in Swahili. Parliament speaks in Swahili. Radio stations speak in Swahili. But then, when you get to those other countries, the official status of Swahili perhaps would be slightly different or is different. But I think that there are languages across the African continent which have higher numbers of speakers because, for example, Nigeria, for example, is so popular, and those west African areas, so that you have higher numbers of speakers. People usually say that Swahili's the most widespread, but you can have a widespread spoken language that's the sort of -- you know, because it's lingua franca status."
28,152,Lauren,That's their positive spin.
28,153,Hannah,Exactly. They want something.
28,154,Lauren,So there're people being educated in Swahili and using it for business. Are there many Swahili-speaking linguists in Tanzania or other countries?
28,155,Hannah,"Yeah, absolutely. There's a sort of, not a divide, but there are people studying Swahili as a subject, and linguists working on Swahili and other, let's say, the main colleagues I have are in east Africa, so other east African languages. I've done lots of work with people at the University of Dar es Salaam. They have a department of linguistics, foreign languages and linguistics. And then also in Zanzibar, and also in Kenya. There are universities where people are doing research on Swahili, and there's linguistic journals written in Swahili, published in Swahili. And then the other big cohort of people would be people in America or Europe who are learning Swahili. In America quite a lot of them are also of African origin. They're from Africa and may have grown up speaking Swahili and then have gone to American universities to teach Swahili or do research and things like that. But, as a whole, there is an ongoing range of challenges that people are facing. Lots of colleagues in African universities or east Africa have real shortages of funding, access to funding, for external conferences, to travel, to do research. There are really high numbers of students, so, you know, again, universities -- which it's great to see so many students interested in these topics and wanting to look at languages and stuff. But, obviously, you know, with limited resources. And then the other thing you find is that in many cases people are, rather than studying Swahili, perhaps, or Bantu languages from a linguistic perspective, people are interested more in the practical applications. Like, if you're in Tanzania, and there are 120 languages and, yes, primary education is in Swahili, most of those children, when they arrive at school, don't speak Swahili. So what can we do about that? What are the practical implications of that? How can we make transitions more smooth? How can we ensure that people who have or have not been to school have access to services, and information, and things like that? More, perhaps, linguistics and language relating to education, relating to access to resources, and stuff like that. Whereas, I think some of the more theoretical linguistics and looking at that for its own sake is -- people are doing that as well, but there's this constant tension between, 'Well, you know, we also have these issues that are right in front of our face and the government wants us to solve them.' And they say, 'Well, you're a linguist at the University of Dar e Salaam. You can solve this or do this.' That's something that you see quite a lot as well in departments that I know."
28,156,Lauren,"Yeah, being super interested in noun classes is great, but it's such a privilege. And, yeah, there's much more pressing -- I imagine people feel that there's much more pressing things that need to be done."
28,157,Hannah,"Absolutely. I suppose there are -- it's great. And there's more and more students who are also thinking that, 'Oh, well, I speak a language that is not written down, that there's no descriptive grammar on, that no one's written an article on. I can contribute to that.' So there are increasingly younger linguists coming through and doing that and seeing that that is really important as well. And that's important for identity, and self-determination, and things like that. But, at the same time, yeah, as, actually, all of us deal with, you know, 'Well, if you want to get a job, how are you going to navigate your interest in that into employment, or stability, or the kind of opportunities that face you?' I've been really lucky to be able to work with fantastic colleagues. Most of my research is in Tanzania so those are the ones I have the strongest links with, but going to conferences is always a great opportunity to meet with people from across the continent, or based at universities in other countries, and things like that."
28,158,Lauren,"Awesome. If you could leave people knowing one thing about linguistics, what would it be?"
28,159,Hannah,"It's awesome. Don't be like me and think that languages are the only thing that's interesting. Also linguistics is interesting! That's also something that you can study. Ah, yes, being monolingual is not the norm in the world."
28,160,Lauren,Right. It's true.
28,161,Hannah,"Yeah, yeah, I don't know how much that's about linguistics. But I think we can, as you were saying earlier on, think that it's normal just to speak a language and actually, globally, it's not."
28,162,Lauren,"Yeah, and I think there are linguistics departments and there's linguistics training that leaves you with that lesson a lot stronger than other departments."
28,163,Hannah,True.
28,164,Lauren,I feel privileged to have been at a university that made that very clear to me.
28,165,Hannah,Me too.
28,166,Lauren,It seems like we had the same experience at SOAS.
28,167,Hannah,Absolutely.
28,168,Lauren,Fabulous. [Music]

28,170,Hannah,Stay lingthusiastic!
29,1,Gretchen,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics! I'm Gretchen McCulloch."
29,2,Lauren,"And I'm Lauren Gawne. And today, we're getting enthusiastic about verbs and how they make sentences happen. But first, Gretchen's book has a release date and I'm very excited."
29,3,Gretchen,"I am so excited. The book is gonna be coming out on July 23rd, 2019. That's very soon. And you can pre-order it now."
29,4,Lauren,"I have, maybe, already read the book and I'm so excited too. I'm just -- it's gonna be the thing that I buy everyone for the next year. If you invite me to your birthday party, or your wedding, or your graduation ceremony in the next 12 months, you'll get a lovely gift-wrapped copy of Gretchen's book."
29,5,Gretchen,"Please invite Lauren to everything so she can buy more copies of the book. And you too can pre-order the book by following the links in the description. It's on the usual places that you get books. Pre-orders are super important because they help the publisher know how many copies to print, which is hopefully lots of copies because the book's gonna be very popular, we hope."
29,6,Lauren,"Between your book and Peta's book, I feel like I've learnt so much about this world of non-academic publishing and it's fascinating. I hadn't realised just how much pre-orders matter in this thing."
29,7,Gretchen,"They're super important. I now need to pre-order everything because of how important I realised it was. It's kind of fun because it's like a present from your past self to your future self, because then you get this book that just shows up when it's out and you don't have to remember about it."
29,8,Lauren,You can use the convenience of Amazon or you can use your local indie book seller if you want to support them.
29,9,Gretchen,"Yeah! Indie bookstores love pre-orders because it's also a guaranteed sale for them. You can use sites like IndieBound, which help you find your local indie bookstore to pre-order from. So you can pre-order the book. It's called Because Internet."
29,10,Lauren,"Oh, yeah. We should tell people that small detail."
29,11,Gretchen,"Yeah. It's called Because Internet. It is a lot easier to search for than the word 'Lingthusiasm' because it is composed of two pre-existing English words, not a word we made up."
29,12,Lauren,True.
29,13,Gretchen,"You can search for Because Internet: Understanding the New Rules of Language wherever good books are sold. And, yeah, I'm excited to get to share it with people! [Music]"
29,14,Gretchen,Verbs. They're so great.
29,15,Lauren,I really like verbs. They've got real personality.
29,16,Gretchen,"Yeah, I especially like all the stuff you can do to make stuff verbs when it wasn't trying to be originally."
29,17,Lauren,"I feel like there's a lot of grammatical anxiety when you ask people what's a verb. There's this instant, like, 'Oh, it's a...it's a 'doing' word.' And that is, sure, that is a definition that might get you so far, but there are so many better definitions."
29,18,Gretchen,"I first learned about verbs from Mad Libs. Remember those things where they had the blanks and they'd be like 'Put in a verb' and then it would be like 'Put in an adverb,' 'Put in an adjective,' like 'I ran down slowly from the treehouse and fell into my fluffy dog' or something like this."
29,19,Lauren,"But you could say, 'I jumped down slowly from the treehouse and hugged my fluffy dog.'"
29,20,Gretchen,"Exactly. You could put in these different versions. And it was -- I don't know how baby Gretchen learned about parts of speech. Yeah, I have this fun Mad Libs-associated memory of verbs. But, yeah, I think when we get presented with like 'Here's a list of verbs. Here's a list of nouns,' it seems like they don't cross over much."
29,21,Lauren,"And that you're -- it supposes that the way you learn what different verbs are is just to memorise lists, which is a terrible thing to do."
29,22,Gretchen,"Yeah, it's not fun at all. I like to think that verbs are things that act like verbs, which of course then brings up the rather large question of 'Well, what does it mean to act like a verb?'"
29,23,Lauren,That is the most circular definition I've ever heard. What do you do next if you've caught yourself in this circle? What is the definition of a verb?
29,24,Gretchen,"When I'm trying to figure out 'Okay, here's this word that I'm encountering, is it acting like a verb? Can I make it act like a verb?' I put it in a sentence where it's forced to act like a verb and see what happens."
29,25,Lauren,Okay.
29,26,Gretchen,If I wanna take -- let's take a brand-new fake word like 'blorp.'
29,27,Lauren,Great fake word.
29,28,Gretchen,"You know, here's 'blorp,' not a pre-existing English word. It sounds like it could be... If I wanna say, 'Can 'blorp' be used as a verb,' then I might say something like 'I blorped you' or 'I'm blorping right now.'"
29,29,Lauren,Okay. 'I blorped out of the treehouse'?
29,30,Gretchen,"'I blorped out of the treehouse and ran down the hill.' And so, the stuff that can fit in this frame, the things that you do with verbs, which is that verbs are the scaffolding or the backbone or the thing that everything else in the sentence can hang onto."
29,31,Lauren,Right.
29,32,Gretchen,"When you use a verb where you have all of these hangers-on, or these other bits of the sentence body, hanging onto them, you can see 'Okay, does this sound like the normal use of this word already or does this sound like it's a new thing that I'm pushing that word into?'"
29,33,Lauren,"I like this idea of them providing the structure, but I worry, since we're gonna talk a lot in this episode about rearranging the structure, that maybe using, like, a spine metaphor might be --"
29,34,Gretchen,A little bit too Frankenstein?
29,35,Lauren,-- a little bit too gross. Maybe we should go for a metaphor that's a little less animate?
29,36,Gretchen,"Okay, okay. What about a coat rack?"
29,37,Lauren,"Okay, yeah, that could work."
29,38,Gretchen,"Okay, so, if a verb is like the coat rack and the nouns and the other bits of the sentence are like the coats and stuff that hang on the coat rack --"
29,39,Lauren,Then different verbs come with different hooks.
29,40,Gretchen,Yeah.
29,41,Lauren,"Yeah, that works."
29,42,Gretchen,"I'm into this. Can you put a word in a place where it's supporting a lot of different other parts of the sentence and does that sound normal, or does that sound like it's an innovation? If you take a word like 'internet,' for example, and you say, 'I'm gonna internet right now' or 'I've got a lot of internetting to do,' or 'Let's just internet that and see what the answer is,' that's using 'internet' like a verb. You have this feeling that that's a novel thing to do or it's a relatively new thing to do. And the canonical use of 'internet' is more like 'What's on the internet right now' or --"
29,43,Lauren,"'The internet is messy,' which is, like, a very noun thing."
29,44,Gretchen,"'The internet is a weird place.' You know, that's a very 'noun' use of 'internet.' You could use it as a verb. You can use anything as a verb if you try hard enough. But the question of 'Is it a verb?' is often 'Is it a pre-established verb that lots of people use it as a verb or is this a new thing that you're doing to it that's verbing it?'"
29,45,Lauren,Yeah.
29,46,Gretchen,"You can verb 'verb,' but the word 'verb' is canonically a noun."
29,47,Lauren,People get really upset when you talk about verbing stuff.
29,48,Gretchen,"Yeah, there's this Calvin and Hobbes quote, 'Verbing weirds language,' which of course is using 'weird' as a verb. And, again, you can make any word into a verb if you try hard enough. But some words are already pre-packaged as verbs and some you have to put a little bit of effort in."
29,49,Lauren,"And when you used 'blorp,' you said, 'I'm blorping right now,' which is like -- 'I'm blorping.' So there's one hook for 'I'm.' Whereas I said, 'I'm blorping out of the treehouse.' So I've got -- 'I'm' is one hook and 'out of the treehouse' is another. So we've used the same -- well, we've possibly used different made-up verbs because we don't really know what 'blorp' means yet. We're doing this all backwards."
29,50,Gretchen,"Well, yeah, more often you start with the meaning. Or if I say, 'I'm blorping you' or 'I blorped that to you,' then I've got two hooks, 'I' and 'you,' or three hooks 'I'm blorping that to you.' We still don't know what 'blorping' is, but we know that it can support these -- you know, if it's our coat rack, it can support the hooks that contain 'I' and 'you' and 'that.'"
29,51,Lauren,"We've already talked a little bit in Episode 9 about constituency, which is this idea that language isn't just a random throwing-together of words. It's not just a bucket of balls. It's actually got this structure, and if you have one word, it comes with these other words. Verbs are a really great example of constituency and how just one verb can bring all these other things to the sentence."
29,52,Gretchen,"Yeah, it can bring them, or it can support them if they're already there. It's creating this thing that things are mentioned around. I think one of my formative experiences with verbs, after Mad Libs, was when I was studying Latin in high school. One of the things about Latin is that you can put the words in almost any order. Especially in poetry, they really rearrange the words a lot, because you wanna line up the ones that rhyme, or you wanna line up the words for a particular rhythm. And so that means that you can have a verb and its nouns in, like, totally different lines and totally different parts of the sentence. And so you're trying to figure out when you're translating Latin poetry -- because that's what you do in intro Latin class. You don't learn how to, like, ask Caesar where to buy pizza, much as maybe that would be useful. You're translating Latin poetry. And you're going through these lines and being like 'Hey, I need figure out what the verbs are, how many of them there are' and, you know, generally, underline them and then figure out which nouns are associated with which verbs. Then I can figure out which adjectives are associated with which nouns and so on down the line, so I can figure out what's actually going on in the sentence."
29,53,Lauren,"And, conveniently, languages have different ways of trying different types of hooks on coat racks, so which ones are the nouns that belong with particular verbs and in what order. I think we should definitely say at the outset that there are lots of different hooks and lots of different ways to arrange them on coat racks both within a particular language and across the world's languages."
29,54,Gretchen,"Yeah, absolutely. I think thinking about this verb-as-coat-rack/noun-as-coats-that-you-can-hook-onto-that is a way of entering into this. There's a huge descriptive tradition of talking about each of these different types of relationships between the number of hooks you can have, and where they are, and what kinds of hooks they are, and what they look like, with all these specific names that are often used there. But it's easy to get bogged down in terminology and think that you have to memorise all this terminology just in order to understand this central idea, which is that verbs support nouns and verbs create the conditions under which nouns can flourish. You can have some numbers of nouns to do that. I think that's the big insight here. And I think you can then walk into the terminology and have a little bit more confidence that you already understand the basic concepts involved."
29,55,Lauren,"Often, you find that different languages will have the same number of hooks. They might be arranged differently for reasons of the particular word order of a language. So if you speak English, hopefully you can think for yourself the verb is in the middle."
29,56,Gretchen,There's this really great example of that that uses the 'I [heart] NY' thing you put on t-shirts.
29,57,Lauren,"Oh, yeah. It's as minimal as possible."
29,58,Gretchen,"Exactly. So 'I' is the subject. The '[heart]' is the verb. And 'New York' is the object. English is 'I [heart] NY,' and then other languages are 'I NY [heart]' or '[Heart] I NY' and so on and so forth down the line."
29,59,Lauren,"And languages use other ways of telling which is which. They can go in any order, like Latin. Sometimes, the hooks are in a particular order because the language says that these are the instructions for how to build it. But each verb has its own instructions for how many hooks to start with."
29,60,Gretchen,"I think that gets us into, initially, what do we mean by 'number of hooks'? What are some differences between different types of hook numbers?"
29,61,Lauren,Okay.
29,62,Gretchen,"You have your simplest sentence, which is one hook, one noun. These are verbs that support, basically, one noun most of the time. So something like 'I'm sleeping,' that supports the 'I.'"
29,63,Lauren,"I have to say, if this was an actual coat rack, you are getting a bad deal on your coat rack. You can just use a coat hanger and put that in your closet. You don't need a coat rack."
29,64,Gretchen,"Yeah, this metaphorical coat rack -- like, often, a regular coat rack will actually let you hang six or eight coats. There aren't a lot of sentences that let you do that. This is a metaphorical coat rack with very few hooks."
29,65,Lauren,Yeah.
29,66,Gretchen,"But your simplest metaphorical coat rack has one hook. 'I sleep,' 'I'm sleeping,' 'I dance,' 'You dance,' 'The dog is sleeping,' these are some individual coats that you can hook onto that metaphorical coat rack."
29,67,Lauren,"Shall we compare that to some that have two, just to give people some contrast? So something like 'I ate' -- you've got here the example 'I ate the apple,' but I always use the example 'I ate the cake' because it's more real-life."
29,68,Gretchen,"I support a diet that includes both cake and apples. 'This message brought to you by...' So, 'I ate the cake,' 'I ate the apple,' both of those -- so 'cake' or 'apple' is the kind of thing that can go on that second hook. Crucially, you can say, 'I ate the cake and the apple,' and the 'and' there lets you hang 'cake' and 'apple' on the same hook. But you can't say something like 'I ate the cake the apple.'"
29,69,Lauren,No.
29,70,Gretchen,That just sounds weird.
29,71,Lauren,Because you're trying to add another hook where it shouldn't be.
29,72,Gretchen,"You're trying to cram two coats onto one hook but you're not giving them any means of relating to each other. You're just like 'No, both of you go here!' And it's like 'No, we can't fit here. I'm sorry.' But you could do something like 'I ate' -- 'Have you eaten yet?' 'Yeah, I ate.'"
29,73,Lauren,"Yeah, obviously implying cake and/or apples but not saying about that."
29,74,Gretchen,"Or food in general. Some verbs let you imply an object. But, you know, you could say something like, 'I ate rocks as a child.'"
29,75,Lauren,"I mean, you could say that."
29,76,Gretchen,"But if you just say, 'I ate,' that doesn't generally imply rocks. It generally implies a sort of food, unless you're, like, a rock-eating creature from science fiction in which case maybe here it's okay."
29,77,Lauren,So we've got some one-hooks. We've got some two-hooks. Can we get some more hooks happening?
29,78,Gretchen,"Yeah, so we can get another hook if you have something like 'give.' You can be like 'I gave you the cake' because I'm a very nice person."
29,79,Lauren,"Mmm, thank you, Gretchen."
29,80,Gretchen,"'I gave you the cake' or 'I gave the cake to you,' both of which have three hooks to put these three different objects."
29,81,Lauren,Or 'I sent you a letter.'
29,82,Gretchen,'I sent you a letter.' Thank you.
29,83,Lauren,"More realistically, 'I sent you a text message.'"
29,84,Gretchen,"We're updating examples for the 21st century. 'I sent you a letter,' 'I sent you a postcard,' 'I sent you a DM on Twitter,' these are different kinds of hooks that you can have on 'send' or 'give.'"
29,85,Lauren,"It would be weird to say, 'I sent you.' I mean you could say that, but it means something very different. I made you go somewhere."
29,86,Gretchen,"Yeah, 'I sent you,' or something like 'I sent you to the store to buy more cake.' There's 'I sent you to the store' -- 'to the store' is kind of interesting here because I could just say, 'I sent you,' but I also have this option of adding on something -- 'to the store,' 'I sent you a message on Monday.'"
29,87,Lauren,Yeah.
29,88,Gretchen,"There's these additional sorts of things you could add on, but they aren't required."
29,89,Lauren,The hooks are very fixed into the coat rack. These are more like -- just think extra hangers.
29,90,Gretchen,"Yeah, okay. You can drape extra hangers on your coat rack. I like how this metaphor's going."
29,91,Lauren,This is a much more realistic coat rack all of a sudden.
29,92,Gretchen,"I'm really glad we didn't do the Frankenstein thing. It becomes a bit of a messy coat rack like many of us probably have at home. The stuff like 'on Monday,' 'to the store,' 'with great alacrity,' you can drape extra things onto a sentence indefinitely. You can just keep piling stuff on there, but it only comes with a few hooks that are actually screwed into the coat rack itself."
29,93,Lauren,So there's a few fixed things but then we can just keep adding and enriching.
29,94,Gretchen,"And the same thing goes -- you know, 'I gave you a book cake.'"
29,95,Lauren,'Book cake'? Like a cake made out of books or a book about cakes?
29,96,Gretchen,"So this is the thing. If we can figure out a way to bundle together 'book cake,' like, maybe it's a cake that looks like a book, then we can hang those both on the same hook. But if we can't figure out how to bundle them together like 'I gave you a book on cake...'"
29,97,Lauren,"No, I can't even fabricate a meaning for that."
29,98,Gretchen,Then those aren't hanging on the hook together properly. This is what we mean when we say a verb tends to have a specific number of nouns that it goes with.
29,99,Lauren,It's an ungrammatical coat rack.
29,100,Gretchen,"The anti-grammatical coat rack. The other one that I really love is coat racks -- okay, you probably can't get this at Ikea, but you can get a metaphorical sentence coat rack with no hook at all."
29,101,Lauren,"Uh, okay? That's just called a pole, Gretchen."
29,102,Gretchen,Definitely don't try to buy this. It's gonna be pretty useless for you. But sentence-wise it's very interesting because you can get verbs like 'It's raining.'
29,103,Lauren,True.
29,104,Gretchen,"If I say, 'It's a cake,' that one's pretty good. We know what 'it' is, 'This is a cake' or something like this, or 'You're a cake,' which is probably an insult? I don't know."
29,105,Lauren,I'm okay with being a cake.
29,106,Gretchen,"But that's a real 'it' there. It's doing something. But if I say, 'It's raining,' I can't say, 'You're raining.'"
29,107,Lauren,That is true.
29,108,Gretchen,"Or 'You're snowing,' or, you know, 'The dog is raining.'"
29,109,Lauren,'It' is not a regular coat compared to 'dog' or 'you' or these other nouns that are proper coats that we can hang on a hook. But 'it' is --
29,110,Gretchen,Maybe it's like one of those fake rain-ponchos that doesn't really work like a coat but you keep it around in your purse in a little plastic container just in case you need a bad coat.
29,111,Lauren,"Awkwardly hang it on your hookless -- and we know that English is weird in terms of this using what I call 'Dummy It.' I mean, not me personally, that's just how I learnt about it. But this 'Dummy It' form is just there because 'rain' as a verb doesn't have any hooks and English freaks out and goes 'Oh, I'd better add something. It's just a pole. I need to make it look like a coat rack.'"
29,112,Gretchen,"This is the thing that's interesting about verbs in particular is that this is how we know that 'rain' is still a verb even though it's not actually supporting any real nouns because it has to support a fake noun because a verb's like, 'I just need a noun.'"
29,113,Lauren,'I wouldn't be a coat rack. I'd be a pole!'
29,114,Gretchen,"'Just pretend that one's there even if it's not really there.' But you get all sorts of other things happening with words like this in other languages. In some languages that don't actually require you to have a pronoun like 'it' -- so in Spanish you can say, 'llueve,' which just means 'rains.'"
29,115,Lauren,Okay.
29,116,Gretchen,"That's all you need. And it's still got that, like, it's still got the ending that you'd have if it was 'he' or 'she' or 'it rains.' It's just that that 'he' or 'she' or 'it' doesn't actually refer to a specific person in the same way that 'It's raining' doesn't refer to a specific person."
29,117,Lauren,"Right. Whereas, I had the opposite when I learnt Nepali. I had to remember that to say, 'It's raining,' you have to say, 'Pani pardaicha,' which is 'Rain is falling' or 'Rain is raining.'"
29,118,Gretchen,"Ah, 'Rain is raining.' So you do need a real noun there. It just has to be always the same noun."
29,119,Lauren,"Well, because you can also say, 'It's snowing' or 'It's some other' --"
29,120,Gretchen,Is that like 'Snow is snowing' or 'snow is raining'?
29,121,Lauren,"'Snow' is just a kind of general 'falling/precipitating' verb. But you have to specify an actual -- you have to have a real coat, a real noun there."
29,122,Gretchen,"Kind of like 'The sun is out' versus 'The clouds are out.' Whereas, the 'is out' isn't doing much or something like that."
29,123,Lauren,And then you have the opposite. In English you could have a sentence like 'Blood rains down on the city.'
29,124,Gretchen,That's a very post-apocalyptic sentence.
29,125,Lauren,"For someone who didn't want the spine metaphor, I'll just go straight into the emo dystopia."
29,126,Gretchen,That's another reason you know that rain is a real verb sometimes because sometimes you could have something rain or like 'Tears rained down my face.'
29,127,Lauren,"Aw, also cheerful. Gosh. Our novel is gonna be so compelling."
29,128,Gretchen,"Well, this is kind of interesting because when I was learning German, I also learned about this thing you can do in German, and presumably in some other languages but not English, where you can make these what they called 'Impersonal Constructions,' but for other verbs that aren't weather verbs. So in German you can say, 'es wurde getanzt,' which means something like 'There was dancing' or 'It danced.'"
29,129,Lauren,"Well, that's nice."
29,130,Gretchen,"And that means 'People danced/We danced/There was dancing in the rain,' maybe. This doesn't mean in the same way that -- it's kind of impersonal so when you translate it in English you use one of these various constructions. But in structure, it's a lot more parallel to 'Es regnet' -- 'It rains.'"
29,131,Lauren,"Hmm, cool. So, again, different languages have slightly different approaches to the coat rack and the number of hooks."
29,132,Gretchen,"But they're all reflecting this idea that there isn't necessarily a real person happening here. You can do a similar thing, I'm thinking of your Nepali example with -- so some verbs in English that normally only have, really, one hook can in some contexts get a second one but only a specific one. So you can say, 'I'm sleeping.' You can't normally 'sleep something.' Like, I can't say, 'I slept a nap.'"
29,133,Lauren,"No. I mean, you could, but I'm gonna flag that as not likely to be grammatical."
29,134,Gretchen,"Yeah, maybe I could try. But you can say, 'I slept the sleep of the just.'"
29,135,Lauren,True.
29,136,Gretchen,Or 'I dreamed a dream of infamy.' I don't know why I'm really pretentious right now.
29,137,Lauren,Because that's the only thing you can do if you wanna add more hooks to 'sleep.'
29,138,Gretchen,"Yeah, like 'I dreamed a dream of times gone by,' which I think is a line from Les Mis. You can only 'dream a dream.' You can 'sleep a sleep.' Can I 'nap a nap?' I don't think so."
29,139,Lauren,I don't think so.
29,140,Gretchen,"There's limitations on what you can do with it, but you can add this extra hook, but it's a fake hook that only gets one thing on it."
29,141,Lauren,"Okay, so we've got our one-hook, two-hook, three-hook -- our one-hook includes our weird Dummy-It-hook."
29,142,Gretchen,Zero-hook.
29,143,Lauren,Zero-ish-hook. Can we add more? Can we get to four?
29,144,Gretchen,"Yeah, I was looking at examples of this and there is a four-hook one. Some people analyse the English for 'bet' as having four hooks. You could say, 'I bet you five dollars on Usain Bolt that he'll win the race.'"
29,145,Lauren,"Okay, he was the only sportsperson that both Gretchen and I could identify off the top of our heads where you would say, 'Lauren bet five dollars on...'"
29,146,Gretchen,"I mean, I could bet you five dollars on Usain Bolt, but I think you would not take this bet because probably he's gonna win."
29,147,Lauren,"Probably, yeah."
29,148,Gretchen,"You can bet a person money on another person, or thing, or animal, or something that might win. And it seems like 'bet' can maybe accomplish this."
29,149,Lauren,"Because 'I bet you' -- so 'I' and 'you,' that's two. 'Five dollars' is another coat. I mean, it's a cheap coat but, you know. And then 'Usain Bolt' is a very fancy coat."
29,150,Gretchen,Very fast coat.
29,151,Lauren,Very fancy coat.
29,152,Gretchen,"It seems like maybe up to four. Again, I wouldn't necessarily buy this coat rack at Ikea because even four hooks is not that many."
29,153,Lauren,But it does show you that verbs come with all this structure. Just a single three-letter word like 'bet' can potentially come with up to four other bits of information built into the structure.
29,154,Gretchen,"Exactly. And, without 'bet,' this whole sentence isn't working. If I just say, 'I you five dollars on Usain Bolt,' this is not working."
29,155,Lauren,"Again, gonna point out, probably not grammatical."
29,156,Gretchen,"Whereas, something like 'I bet you five dollars' or 'I bet five dollars on Usain Bolt' or 'Betcha five dollars on Usain Bolt,' if you drop one of these nouns, it's not as much of a problem."
29,157,Lauren,Yeah.
29,158,Gretchen,"Whereas, the verb is really providing the scaffolding, or the support, or the hooks, for the rest of the sentence to happen."
29,159,Lauren,"We've been talking about coat racks and hooks, but you may actually recognise the terminology that all this refers to, which is 'transitivity.' It's a verb-y word that comes up when people learn grammar."
29,160,Gretchen,"Yeah, 'transitivity' takes as a metaphor that a sentence goes across because this is from the Latin word 'to go across/to translate/to transport.' It goes across from the subject to the object. If you have a transitive sentence, it goes 'I see the book,' or a sentence that doesn't go across -- 'I slept.' That's a core metaphor when it comes to transitivity. It's just that this metaphor has a bit of a difficult time with the sentences that have zero hooks, and four hooks, and some of these further expansions beyond what the original grammatical tradition had. So we're looking at it with a different metaphor."
29,161,Lauren,"Once we have a verb, we can get an idea for how many hooks it probably has as a default, but that doesn't mean we can't rearrange the hooks. Our coat rack is actually quite modular and flexible, and we can play around with it, which is a lot of fun."
29,162,Gretchen,"Yeah, this is the DIY home-improvement project. One of my favourites is you can say something like 'I made you read the book.' In contrast to regular 'I read the book/You read the book,' 'I made you read the book,' this 'make' is just introducing another hook. You have 'I made you read the book.' Now you have three hooks on a verb that formerly only had two."
29,163,Lauren,"We can add hooks that way. There's another way to add a hook, which is to say, 'I baked a cake for you, Gretchen.'"
29,164,Gretchen,"Oh, thank you. Thank you."
29,165,Lauren,"By adding the 'for' there, I've added another reason to have a hook."
29,166,Gretchen,'I made you bake a cake for me.'
29,167,Lauren,We're adding hooks all over the place.
29,168,Gretchen,Now we've got four hooks! You can just keep adding them on top of each other.
29,169,Lauren,"In English we use verbs to do this, but just to specify why we're calling this 'adding hooks' is because in other languages they don't necessarily use other verbs to make these extra hooks appear. They use bits of morphemes and bits of words."
29,170,Gretchen,"Yeah, in English we use a verb to make someone, cause something to do something -- 'I made you bake the cake' or 'I caused you to bake the cake.' But when I bake the cake 'for you,' I added that with a preposition."
29,171,Lauren,True.
29,172,Gretchen,"Those look like they're different ways of adding things, but in some languages all of those different types of meaning are expressed by, say, adding one of the same type of little particle, or adding one of the same type of little affix onto the verb. There are good reasons to group them together when you consider languages as a group."
29,173,Lauren,Not just English. We're not just thinking about English coat racks today.
29,174,Gretchen,"Yeah, this is the kind of thing when you group them all together, it pays out in the long run."
29,175,Lauren,"You have another form of adding hooks that I had never heard of this terminology before, but I love it and we're just gonna tell people what the terminology is."
29,176,Gretchen,"So the terminology for this one -- the other ones have complicated-sounding names like 'causative' and 'benefactive,' which, like, it's fine. They're useful if you know Latin. But these ones are called the 'Spray/Load Alternation.' And what I love about the Spray/Load Alternation is it contains examples right in the name, which I think more words should do. So you can say something like 'I sprayed the walls with paint' or 'I sprayed paint onto the walls.'"
29,177,Lauren,"Hmm, yeah, true."
29,178,Gretchen,"Or say something like 'I loaded the truck with hay,' 'I loaded hay onto the truck.' In both cases you have two main hooks."
29,179,Lauren,'I sprayed the walls' or 'I sprayed paint.'
29,180,Gretchen,"Yeah. And you have one additional hook that's like our coat rack hook that's being added on like 'with paint' or 'onto the walls.' But you can alternate which one you want to make the main hook that's attached to the coat rack proper and the one that's, like, the more peripheral one that's your coat hanger one that's further away with the preposition there. There's a whole list of words that have this alternation. It's kind of nifty that there's just a couple dozen words in English that do this kind of thing. There are people who, you know, go through and make lists of the words that belong to different types of categories like this because you want to maybe use them in psycholinguistic experiments. Or you can test what happens if you give people certain types of pictures. What do they look at first? If you give them 'I sprayed the walls with paint' versus 'I sprayed paint onto the walls,' you can give them the same drawing and see where they look first and these kinds of things."
29,181,Lauren,"Those examples are about adding hooks or deciding what's a hook and what's a coat hanger. It is also possible to remove hooks from sentences. If I have something like 'I broke the /vɑz/' -- Gretchen would have 'I broke the /veɪs/,' I believe."
29,182,Gretchen,"Yeah, I think I'd say, 'I broke the /veɪs/,'"
29,183,Lauren,"We'll say that's the same sentence. So 'I broke the vase,' 'I' and 'the vase,' I've got two coats hanging up there. But if I had a sentence like 'The vase was broken,' who knows how!"
29,184,Gretchen,Maybe it was the dog. Maybe it was me.
29,185,Lauren,I can't tell because I don't have that second hook anymore. I've only got one for the vase.
29,186,Gretchen,"Yeah, and so being able to demote hooks, and unscrew them, and take them off, and throw them away. Or you can say something like 'The /vɑz/ broke' -- 'The /veɪs/ broke.' I don't know. I say both. 'The vase broke,' this could imply that maybe it just got too old and brittle and it spontaneously broke. Maybe no one particularly did it."
29,187,Lauren,"I really love this alibi you're building, Gretchen."
29,188,Gretchen,"You know, I'm just saying... it wasn't me. Yeah, so this ability to promote and demote things, which I think is super important because we don't often say sentences in a complete vacuum. That's the kind of thing that happens in, like, psycholinguistic experiments. You bring people into the lab. You play them a sentence. You show them a picture. And you say, 'What does this mean? Press a button.'"
29,189,Lauren,"It always looks very nice in a linguistics textbook, and then you actually speak in the real world."
29,190,Gretchen,"Yeah, and in the real world, most of the time we say things with an established set of context. We have a story we're already bringing a sentence into. And that story already has people that are more and less important, or already has people that are more and less familiar. In a story, we wanna highlight who is given information and who is not given information, who is already interesting to us for the purpose of the story, who isn't. If the story's about, you know, 'Here's all these types of things about the vase' versus if the story's about 'Here's all the trouble my dog got into,' we might want to highlight different things."
29,191,Lauren,So we might want to hang the vase more prominently or make the hook for the dog more prominent.
29,192,Gretchen,"Yeah, exactly. Or you can picture, I don't know, like, a museum inscription is gonna be like 'Well, this vase clearly broke a hundred years ago. We can tell that by the cracks on it. Blah blah blah...' But maybe the museum doesn't know who broke it. So it wouldn't make sense to be like 'Someone clearly broke this vase. Someone or something unknown clearly broke this vase a hundred years ago. We can tell this by the cracks.' The important part here is this is the description of the vase. But in other circumstances, we might want to highlight that. I think there's this bigger question, 'Okay, so verbs can support this whole scaffolding or this whole coat rack of a sentence, but what does it mean to have different types of hooks? Why would we want to be able to shuffle around how the coats are arranged on this metaphorical coat rack?'"
29,193,Lauren,"I think it's also important that we have one flexible coat rack instead of many different coat racks for every single context. For some verbs we do have this. So if you think about, like, the similarity or difference between 'kill' and 'die.' If someone dies, then you have one hook. And if someone kills another person, you have two hooks."
29,194,Gretchen,"I can't say, 'I died you.'"
29,195,Lauren,No.
29,196,Gretchen,"Unless it means, like, I changed the colour of you. But that's a completely different word."
29,197,Lauren,That's a completely different coat rack this time.
29,198,Gretchen,"Whereas, I can say, 'I killed you.' It's harder to say, 'I killed.' That implies I killed someone or something."
29,199,Lauren,"Yes, it always implies that there's a second hook that's being removed. Imagine if for every single verb every time we wanted to add a hook or remove a hook, we needed a completely different word. It's okay with a handful. English can cope with a handful. Other languages might have a handful. Or we might have verbs that -- in some languages 'kill' and 'die' are pretty much the same verb with some of those different extra affixes or particles you talked about."
29,200,Gretchen,"So you could do something like 'I caused you to die' or 'I made you die,' which then means 'I killed you.'"
29,201,Lauren,"In Syuba, one of the languages I work with, the verb for 'to scatter,' like 'to scatter grains,' is just 'I caused grain to fall.'"
29,202,Gretchen,"Okay, yeah. This works."
29,203,Lauren,"Using that 'I made it' hook to create an extra hook. And so in some languages, things that are two different coat racks are just the same coat rack. But imagine if all languages had --"
29,204,Gretchen,"Every single verb had a completely different form like 'kill' versus 'die,' or like 'push' versus 'fall.' In some languages 'to push something' is just 'I caused it to fall.'"
29,205,Lauren,Exactly.
29,206,Gretchen,"And, again, imagine if every single pair of words instead of saying, 'I caused it to fall,' 'I caused you to bake a cake for me,' I had to say instead of 'you bake a cake for me' -- 'You 'blorp' a cake for me.' That's a completely different word."
29,207,Lauren,That is the best definition.
29,208,Gretchen,To 'blorp' is to cause someone to make a cake for someone?
29,209,Lauren,Yeah. That is correct.
29,210,Gretchen,"Yeah, so you had to change it completely. And 'blorp' is sounding similar to 'bake,' but we know that 'push' and 'fall,' and 'kill' and 'die' don't sound at all similar to each other."
29,211,Lauren,Yeah.
29,212,Gretchen,This is gonna be like 'florp' or something like this. So you were talking about earlier how the words in a sentence aren't just little balls in a jar where they all just go in and tumble around with each other.
29,213,Lauren,"No, they have this wonderful coat rack structure."
29,214,Gretchen,"Or they could have another type of structure which I've started thinking about, which is, do you know those little plastic balls and beads and rods that you can get from, like, chemistry sets?"
29,215,Lauren,"Ah, I always liked -- it was one of the fun things about chemistry, how visual it was."
29,216,Gretchen,"Yeah, so you could connect oxygen and hydrogen, and you make H2O. And you have, like, two hydrogen molecules connected to the one oxygen and these kinds of things."
29,217,Lauren,"I mean, it's been a long time since I've done chemistry so I'm probably just gonna agree with whatever you say here."
29,218,Gretchen,"Yeah, it's been a long time since I did chemistry as well. But I was thinking about it because different types of atoms like oxygen and hydrogen have different ways of connecting with each other that are characteristic of those atoms. You can make these kinds of connections between those little balls in a way that's similar to how you can make connections between how nouns connect onto verbs to form sentences."
29,219,Lauren,"Ah, yeah."
29,220,Gretchen,"Like, you have little sentence molecules."
29,221,Lauren,True.
29,222,Gretchen,A sentence is just a word molecule.
29,223,Lauren,I like that.
29,224,Gretchen,"Yeah, and it turns out that I'm not the first person to notice this connection because there's a term for this type of phenomenon, which is 'valency,' which is used in both chemistry and linguistics."
29,225,Lauren,"Huh. I mean, I know the word 'valency' and I just never, ever thought about how that's also the word that they use for molecules in chemistry."
29,226,Gretchen,"Yeah, so this goes back to the 1800s when some linguist was looking over at chemistry and being like, 'They're doing all this stuff with valency about how little things connect with each other, but what if we borrowed this metaphor over here?' And now we've forgotten that these were once really connected."
29,227,Lauren,Who was that?
29,228,Gretchen,This was Charles S. Peirce --
29,229,Lauren,"Ah, there we go."
29,230,Gretchen,"-- who wrote a paper in 1897 about the connection here. And then it comes up in linguistics again a few decades later. There's this connection between, 'Okay, how many other atoms can connect to this one' and 'how many other words can glom onto this sentence? How many nouns can we have on this verb?'"
29,231,Lauren,"We need little, like, verb-diagram structures the way that chemistry has those little atom structures."
29,232,Gretchen,"Yeah, because you can draw them both on paper. You can draw atom bonds on paper, and you can draw syntax trees to draw the connections between the words. But chemistry gets these great plastic, manipulatable tools."
29,233,Lauren,"We should sell little mini coat racks, Gretchen."
29,234,Gretchen,Oh my gosh. New business plan. Little mini coat racks to draw your sentence trees on.
29,235,Lauren,That would be delightful.
29,236,Gretchen,That's definitely what we're not gonna do. [Music]

30,2,Lauren,"And I'm Lauren Gawne. And in today's episode, we're getting enthusiastic about the gestures that we make when we speak. But first, welcome to our first video episode."
30,3,Gretchen,Video!
30,4,Lauren,"Very exciting. Thanks to our patrons, we reached a funding goal where we were able to pay for the extra production costs to have a video. And, of course, as soon as we decided that, I couldn't help but hope that we would do a gesture episode. And so that is our first video episode."

30,6,Gretchen,"And now gestures. Lauren, they're really cool. You've done proper research on these."
30,7,Lauren,"I have, yes."
30,8,Gretchen,How did you get into gestures?
30,9,Lauren,"I did a Bachelor of Arts undergraduate and, like many people, kind of found linguistics in my first year of doing an undergraduate degree and thought, 'This subject is so cool!' that I was still doing it, and I was majoring in it by the end of my third year. And in the last semester of third year, I thought linguistics was cool, but I really thought that I wanted to do further study in art history. And then in the final class, the final semester, I took a subject called 'Language and Culture' with Barb Kelly, who I blame a lot of my --"
30,10,Gretchen,Barb Kelly is great.
30,11,Lauren,"-- interests on. One week of this class on language and culture was about this topic of gesture studies that she'd done some work in. And by the time you get to third year of linguistics, you kind of know about sounds, and phonetics, and syntax, and sentence structure..."
30,12,Gretchen,And you think you kind of know it all.
30,13,Lauren,"Yeah, and you especially think you know it all by the end of third year, and that completely changes the more that you study and the less, you realise, you knew. And learning about gesture was one of those moments where I was just like 'There's this whole part of language that I've never thought of before.' And within about two weeks of that set of lectures, I had changed my major and changed my future study plans. I kind of jumped in deep."
30,14,Gretchen,Yeah.
30,15,Lauren,And I have not regretted it ever since.
30,16,Gretchen,"I only really found out about gesture because of you and because we were talking about part of my book that looks at emoji, and you were like, 'There's actually some gesture stuff that's relevant to this.'"
30,17,Lauren,"Yes, I'm so pleased that I managed to convince you to reference gesture even in the book on the internet where there's technically no people around to gesture. We still found that gesture was relevant."
30,18,Gretchen,"Well, and I had the same experience of just -- this was more recently -- just thinking I knew most of how linguistics works and then walking around being like 'This is so cool.' I'm slightly spying on people in restaurants and around me. I'm like 'They're using gestures so much.'"
30,19,Lauren,"It's true. Once you start paying attention to gesture, it's really hard to stop. And I really apologise to all of you watching this video who are now gonna be analysing our gestures. I'm sure Gretchen's gonna spend half the episode watching her own hands."
30,20,Gretchen,"Yeah, this is what I was doing. I was typing with one hand [gestures one hand typing, one hand raised], and I was like 'Okay, so if I do this [positions raised hand] ...if I do this [repositions raised hand] ...' with the other hand. It was very..."
30,21,Lauren,You begin to see language as being a much bigger thing and used in a whole different way.
30,22,Gretchen,"Yeah, absolutely. So that kind brings us to our first big idea in gesture, which is that it helps with thinking."
30,23,Lauren,"Yeah, so I think the important thing to say is, as far as we know, everyone in every culture that we've come across, and speakers of all languages, gesture. In the way that we think of language as something that all humans have, gesture is part of that. We haven't come across a speech community yet who don't have gesture in their communicative, little toolkit. Even -- I mean, not 'even' -- but that also includes signed languages. And, you know, admittedly, it's a bit of a grey area for some of them because both the gesture and the sign component use the same materials. For speakers of spoken languages, you obviously have two different channels happening. You have the spoken channel and the hand channel for the gestures. But signed languages do have components that really should be analysed gesturally. I remember when I was learning -- I was in an Auslan class. And our Auslan professor was showing us a story that someone was telling in Auslan. And then they asked us to kind of pick out the signs. He wanted us to tell him what vocabulary we got from the story. And there were a couple of items where we were like 'He opens a can.' And the sign teacher was like 'Oh, that's not a sign, though. That's just a gesture.' You could see people in the class were really like, kind of -- not confused, but there is a boundary between what is a lexical item and what is just a gestural representation from the story."
30,24,Gretchen,"So the kind of thing you might find in a signed dictionary that is specifically listing the signs and how they interact with each other grammatically? And you just decide to spontaneously do that because that's how you'd interact with the world, or...?"
30,25,Lauren,Yeah.
30,26,Gretchen,That's what you're trying to convey?
30,27,Lauren,"So that's kind of a good example. But all languages, regardless of whether they're spoken or signed, also use gesture as part of their communicative skillset."
30,28,Gretchen,An important part of the communicative skillset because it helps do things like solve puzzles?
30,29,Lauren,"Yes, it helps you do all kinds of cognitive things. If you are doing, particularly, spacial things -- so if you're talking about directions or the relationships between objects -- you tend to gesture more frequently. If you are trying to solve -- you know those rotation puzzles that they make you do in IQ tests, and memory tests, and that kind of stuff?"
30,30,Gretchen,'Which of these figures is a rotation of the one up here?'
30,31,Lauren,Yeah.
30,32,Gretchen,And people will imaginarily gesture them?
30,33,Lauren,"[Gestures holding a round object and turning it different ways] If people gesture to kind of figure out the rotation, they tend to perform better. What's really cool is the gesture seems to activate that kind of space-y part of the brain. And so if you tell people to do it for the first set of an experiment, if you get them to do the same kind of activity five minutes later, they'll still remember -- even if they're not gesturing this time, their brain is more warmed up for the spatial stuff. They'll still do better the second time around as well."
30,34,Gretchen,"Oh, that's really neat."
30,35,Lauren,Yeah.
30,36,Gretchen,Yeah.
30,37,Lauren,There's lots of great experiments. There's a really great summary paper that I'll link to in the show notes about that and some other experiments.
30,38,Gretchen,"And I think when kids are learning how to do math, you can tell them to gesture, and count on their fingers, and stuff like that?"
30,39,Lauren,"There is a lot of work in the teaching space that gesture really helps with acquiring abstract, complex mathematical concepts."
30,40,Gretchen,"And I think it's probably worth mentioning here that we're talking about the kinds of gestures you do at the same time as speech, and they happen very much in parallel with speech. [Makes a continuous chop-like gesture with her hand] So, as I'm saying each syllable, hey, look, I'm gesturing at the same time! Now it broke. I started laughing."
30,41,Lauren,"And the thing is, it's true. What's really impressive about that is, if you think about -- if [gestures the round object] you do the rotation task, I'm starting to move my hand at the [gestures the round object] 'and you do' so that it's ready for the rotation task bit, which means that my brain knows where I want to get to, to make this gesture happen at the same time as 'rotation task.' So I'm starting to move before I've even said that bit. The gesture and speech are really closely timed there, and we can really mess this up for people. Some of the gesture experiments often sound a bit mean."
30,42,Gretchen,"Oh, no!"
30,43,Lauren,But we can really mess this up for people by putting headphones on and delaying their speech by just a fraction of a second.
30,44,Gretchen,Okay.
30,45,Lauren,"And if we delay the way someone speaks so they hear their own voice back a few milliseconds afterwards, it actually just completely disrupts their ability to gesture."
30,46,Gretchen,This sounds terrible.
30,47,Lauren,"It's really, really mean. Another thing that we can do is we can often make people more disfluent by preventing them from moving their hands while they talk."
30,48,Gretchen,"Yeah, there's this terrible, hilarious experiment where they get people, and they put them in chairs, and they say, 'Actually, what we're studying is the physiographical measurements of whether your skin is conducting electricity,' and so they strap them down, and they put fake electrodes on their skin."
30,49,Lauren,"And so they get them sitting here, and then they ask them to tell a story, and it increases disfluency. It makes it harder to --"
30,50,Gretchen,So they say more 'um''s and 'ah''s?
30,51,Lauren,"They find it harder to remember words, and it's usually more likely to be nouns. So there's something about gesturing that helps us remain fluent. And I think it's part of why there's that public speaking training thing that trains people to use their gestures more because there is a link between fluently gesturing and fluently speaking."
30,52,Gretchen,"Or trains people to do big, simple, bold gestures rather than putting your hand in pocket and jiggling with your coins, or tapping you pen, or something that can be a more distracting gesture because it adds audio. Although, I guess classically, you don't really consider tapping a pen to be a gesture because you have an object, but..."
30,53,Lauren,There's a whole kind of relationship between what's a gesture and what isn't.
30,54,Gretchen,There's a whole taxonomy. But you can substitute those kinds of repetitive movements for a proper gesture that makes you look more sophisticated as a speaker?
30,55,Lauren,"Sure. And it may actually help you speak more fluently in more fluent sentences, which is a nice benefit as well."
30,56,Gretchen,"I also really like the bit about when kids are learning words -- so kids: They're first learning words. And they go through this one-word stage, and they learn things like 'doggy' and 'mama' and 'papa' and 'water' and stuff like this, and then eventually they end up at this two-word stage. Before that...?"
30,57,Lauren,"There's this really nice period in between where we have the -- so gestures are kind of important for adults and in their ability to speak fluently. But when we look at children, we also see that between the one-word phase and the two-word phase is this phase that you may not even be paying attention to as a parent, but as a gesture-researcher, I'm paying a lot of attention to, which is the one-word plus one-gesture phase. And so you'll often get things like [gestures straight, extended arm with fingers in a continues grabbing motion] 'want,' or..."
30,58,Gretchen,"Or like [gestures the extended arm] 'cookie' or something like this? Like, 'I want the cookie.'"
30,59,Lauren,"Yes, well, [points to her right] we've got some over there. [Both gesture the extended arm toward the right] It's 'biscuit.'"
30,60,Gretchen,'Bikky'?
30,61,Lauren,"[Gestures the extended arm] My child will say 'bikky' or 'biscuit,' and they'll do the grabbing, which means -- it's a complex little bit of language there. They're not just saying, [generally gestures to the right with her hand] 'Oh, there is a biscuit.'"
30,62,Gretchen,"'Lo, biscuit!'"
30,63,Lauren,"They are saying, 'I would like that biscuit' or 'I want biscuit.'"
30,64,Gretchen,'Give me that biscuit' or 'Eat the biscuit.'
30,65,Lauren,"So they're not saying, 'Want biscuit,' which would be a nice two-word phase, they're saying -- or 'Give me biscuit' or something -- they're saying, 'biscuit,' and they're doing this gesture. And the gesture acts like the verb-y bit of that sentence."
30,66,Gretchen,Or kind of classic [points center-right] 'Doggy!'
30,67,Lauren,Yes.
30,68,Gretchen,"Like, 'Look! A dog!'"
30,69,Lauren,"[Generally gestures center-right with both hands] 'Mum, I am alerting you to the fact that there is a dog here,' which is a bit beyond most 18-month-olds, so..."
30,70,Gretchen,"If anyone could have it, it would be you."
30,71,Lauren,"We have a really great, increasingly robust set of research that shows that the one-word, one-gesture phase is a really great predictor that two words are just around the corner!"
30,72,Gretchen,"Oooh, that's great."
30,73,Lauren,Yeah.
30,74,Gretchen,Gesture is also influenced by the grammatical structure of the language?
30,75,Lauren,"Yes, so everyone does gesture across languages and across cultures. There is some amount of -- there's a lot of stereotypes about different cultures gesturing more or gesturing in particular ways. There is some evidence that some of that is true. But, actually, there's so much variation between individual speakers in languages, and even for an individual speaker in different contexts, that a lot of those generalisations are actually quite hard to really quite capture. And that's why I like gesture. There are so many more questions to ask, and we need to think of ways to ask them, compared to the corpus analysis you can do for spoken language."
30,76,Gretchen,"And it's a really new field, I think, definitely facilitated by the fact that we have easy access to video now. And it's a lot easier to pause frame-by-frame than back when -- even when video was film or when there was not video at all, and to go through and annotate for all the different gestures and these kinds of things."
30,77,Lauren,Even the idea of a large corpus to study in gesture is excitingly new. And being able to go back and see what people did and being able to share that with other people -- it's one thing to record it. It's another thing to be able to pop it up on YouTube or something like that for other people to see.
30,78,Gretchen,"Yeah, I mean, rather than mail VHS cassettes around the world? Oh, this sounds really painful."
30,79,Lauren,"It was a thing that we had to do, so..."
30,80,Gretchen,"Or make line drawings so you can include them in your paper, rather than just saying, 'The gestures for this can all be found at this nice URL.'"
30,81,Lauren,"Yeah, 'Here's a nice photographic still of it, and you can actually see all the videos,' is a really exciting development in gesture."
30,82,Gretchen,"One of my favourite examples of gesture mirroring the structure of language is from a talk that I saw by Goldin-Meadow a couple years ago. She gives this example with English and Turkish, but it works in French as well. And I actually speak French, so I'm gonna use French for the example."
30,83,Lauren,"Yeah, that's fine. I won't make you speak Turkish."
30,84,Gretchen,"I know, like, a couple words in Turkish, but I couldn't pronounce it with confidence so... So in English, if you ask English speakers to gesture [gestures a rolling motion with one hand] 'The ball is rolling down the hill,' [Lauren gestures rolling motion with one finger moving toward her left] or even if you make them -- [gestures drawing a circular path in the air with one finger]. Or if you make them do it without words alongside, you'll often get something like [gestures a linear path going from her upper left to lower right] [Lauren gestures a linear path going from her upper left to lower right while indicating a rolling motion with one finger] 'down,' like 'rolling down the hill.' And then if you get Turkish speakers to do the gesture, or French speakers, in those languages, rather than have -- so in English, the verb-part is 'roll.' And then we have and additional bit that's 'down.' Whereas, in French, the verb part is 'to descend,' 'descendre' -- 'to go down.' And then you have to add on, separately, the 'rolling' bit. So the [both gesture the linear path] directional gesture doesn't necessarily have [gestures the linear, rolling path] 'rolling down' at the same time -- if I got that right?"
30,85,Lauren,You did get that right. That is correct. Good work.
30,86,Gretchen,And so people reflect this grammatical structure difference in how they gesture about things doing these types of actions.
30,87,Lauren,"And not just because I'm very well-trained, and going along with what Gretchen said, that people weren't being called attention to for this, they would just watch -- English speakers, and French speakers, or Turkish speakers would watch exactly the same video of a nice little tomato rolling down a hill. Or another study that's very famous for this is Asli Özyürek and Sotaro Kita's work, where they made people watch a Looney Tunes cartoon. One of the characters goes rolling across the screen. And, even though they watch exactly the same video, when they're telling the story, their gestures align with the grammatical structure of the language. So a language like English where that way of rolling is really closely linked into the verb, [gestures the linear, rolling path] that will all be integrated. And then for Turkish or French, they're more interested in the path, [gestures the linear path] so that descent, and then [gestures a rolling motion with her finger] if there is rolling, it's indicated separately. And so you see that the grammar of the language shape those particular gestures."
30,88,Gretchen,"Which I always thought was cool because it's not just 'rolling' and 'down.' All of the verbs of manner like 'rolling' and 'jumping' and 'bouncing' in English are verb-y. And I'd been like 'Oh, yeah, in French, you have to say, 'to descend while jumping' or 'to descend while rolling' or 'to ascend while jumping.'' And even in English, if you want to say this, you have to borrow these very French-y/Latin-y verbs to be able to do that."
30,89,Lauren,"And we know that this is not just because English speakers watch each other all the time and learn these gestures by habit, or Turkish speakers watch each other all the time, because there was a follow-up study by some of the original authors that looked at what happens with people who are blind from birth. And even if you've never seen other people gesture -- the fact that people still gesture if they're blind from birth is quite interesting in and of itself. But the people who gestured, gestured pretty much the exact same way in terms of that [gestures linear, rolling path] 'rolling down the hill' or [gestures the linear path, and then a rolling motion with her finger] 'descending and rolling' than other people who speak the language. So it seems to be something deeply embedded cognitively and not something that we just learn by habit."
30,90,Gretchen,"Yeah, so it's not like we learn by seeing the gestures from other people, we learn it from the grammar of the language, and we gesture that way spontaneously."
30,91,Lauren,Another nice piece of evidence for that is some of those original authors also did a follow-up looking at what happens as Japanese speakers learn English.
30,92,Gretchen,Okay.
30,93,Lauren,"And the studies so far indicate that they do behave differently -- they don't behave exactly the same as English speakers, but when they're speaking English, they behave more like the English speakers than their Japanese-speaking counterparts."
30,94,Gretchen,"Okay, so they've acquired something of the gestural system as they acquire the language?"
30,95,Lauren,"Yeah, as they acquire the language it kind of re-shapes how they conceptualise the movement as well when they re-tell those activities."
30,96,Gretchen,I should volunteer for the French/English version of the study.
30,97,Lauren,"There are increasingly some studies about what happens with your gesture in your second language, so you may be a participant in a future study."
30,98,Gretchen,"All right, hit me up! I wanna do this."
30,99,Lauren,Excellent.
30,100,Gretchen,"We're kind of heading into there already. So gesture helps with thinking, and gesture also helps with communicating?"
30,101,Lauren,Yes.
30,102,Gretchen,"It's not just 'Okay, English -- I gesture like an English speaker, and that's just how I'm gonna gesture.' It's also that I can convey certain things with gestures?"
30,103,Lauren,"Yes, so we can modify our gestures the way we modify our language to be helpful. And I think sometimes it's good to think about gesture as being good for us in our own thinking as well as being good for communication. Some people try and make a claim that it's more important for one or the other. I think that takes all the fun out of it."
30,104,Gretchen,It's both.
30,105,Lauren,"I think gestures are so great, they can do both."
30,106,Gretchen,As the gif goes [gestures a shrugging motion with hands and arms turned upward] 'Why not both?'
30,107,Lauren,"[gestures the same] 'Why not both?' We see with communication -- so maybe just to make you hypothesise, Gretchen..."
30,108,Gretchen,Okay?
30,109,Lauren,"If we had someone speaking into a telephone versus someone -- they're hands-free. We'll give them their hands -- someone speaking into a telephone versus someone in a face-to-face conversation, who would you imagine gestures more?"
30,110,Gretchen,Probably the face-to-face conversation.
30,111,Lauren,"Yeah, because...?"
30,112,Gretchen,"Because the other person can actually see the gestures, and they're useful."
30,113,Lauren,"Yeah, we can increase the frequency. Even if we're speaking into a telephone versus speaking into a Dictaphone that we think no one will ever listen to again, we're even less likely, for the Dictaphone, to gesture because we don't think our communication is going to anyone, so we probably just don't try as a hard to communicate at all."
30,114,Gretchen,"What if you're talking to yourself, and you're not being recorded at all, do you still gesture?"
30,115,Lauren,"Yeah, people a lot of times gesture to themselves."
30,116,Gretchen,"I mean, I guess you would. But would you gesture more because I can see myself when I'm talking to myself?"
30,117,Lauren,We'll have to run an experiment.
30,118,Gretchen,We'll have to run this study.
30,119,Lauren,"So, yeah, we do gesture. We do tend to gesture more if we're in a face-to-face situation because we know that our gestures are gonna be helpful to the other person."
30,120,Gretchen,"I really loved the follow-up study to this, which was -- or not necessarily by the same people, but a similar vein -- where people are cooperative or feeling un-cooperative."
30,121,Lauren,"Ah, yeah, so this is -- we gesture more if we're face-to-face with someone and our gestures are gonna be interpreted as useful. But if we're gesturing to someone competitively versus if we're gesturing to someone who we're cooperating with -- this was a study where they had people playing a game. They taught one person the rules of the game. And then they said, 'We're gonna bring in someone else.' And for half the participants they said, 'This person is your collaborator. If you work together, you'll be able to earn more points and win.'"
30,122,Gretchen,It's one of those games where you have to set some objects in an area or something like this? Probably?
30,123,Lauren,"Yeah. And then other half of the people, they said, 'We're gonna bring someone in, and you're gonna teach this person the game, but then you're gonna compete against each other in it.' And they found that people actually made the same number of gestures. So it's not just about the frequency. What they found differed was the quality and size of the gestures."
30,124,Gretchen,"Oh, so you make bad gestures to people you don't like?"
30,125,Lauren,"You might still make all these gestures, but communicatively, you make them clearer to the person that you want to help more."
30,126,Gretchen,"So instead of being like [leans over and points to a spot on the table in front of her] 'Put this right here' you're like [generally gestures toward the table with her hand, palm up] 'Yeah, just put it over there.'"
30,127,Lauren,"Yeah, that's what they found."
30,128,Gretchen,That's so good.
30,129,Lauren,"The communication -- the fact that we're face-to-face -- makes us want to help people more, but only if we want to be helpful to them."
30,130,Gretchen,"I really wanted to know how they got people to be mad. I thought they were told somebody -- 'Oh, this person's been spreading rumours about your behind your back,' they just told them it was a competition. That's very simple."
30,131,Lauren,"They just told them it was a good old competition, so... Yeah, next time you're teaching someone how to play a board game, make note of whether you're going to be playing with them or against them and see --"
30,132,Gretchen,"Well, there are some games that are collaborative. Like Pandemic's collaborative, so maybe people are gonna be more cooperative in their gestures, versus something like Risk where you're also going around the world but trying to compete."
30,133,Lauren,Yeah.
30,134,Gretchen,We'll have to do a study.
30,135,Lauren,"Gestures are also useful communicatively because they can give information that's not in the spoken channel. For those rolling gestures that we talked about before, some of the studies have gone back and looked at -- they've just kind of quickly counted whether people gestured in the same direction as the original video that they watched."
30,136,Gretchen,Okay.
30,137,Lauren,"And people do this more than 90% of the time. If you watch a character go from one side [hold up left hand] of the screen [holds up right hand] to the other, you'll represent those gestures [holds up left hand then right hand] in the same direction that you saw them."
30,138,Gretchen,"In the same way, rather than spontaneously flipping it for no reason?"
30,139,Lauren,"Yeah, and you don't say, 'It rolled down the hill from the left top of the screen to the bottom right of the screen,' but your interlocuter -- to use the fancy word -- the person you're talking to -- to use the normal words -- will also tend to remember that you gave that information, not consciously necessarily, but it's part of the information -- you get a slightly different set of information from gestures."
30,140,Gretchen,"Does this work the same way for all languages? So, if not all languages have words for 'left' and 'right,' does it still do the same thing?"
30,141,Lauren,"It really depends on the interactional context. Again, I think this is a general thing we can say about gesture research is that there is just so much that hasn't been done. The work that has been done has been done on a very small set of, usually European, languages. So for a lot of these things we can often say, 'That's a great question. Hopefully, someone will do this work.'"
30,142,Gretchen,'Stay tuned for the next exciting three decades in gesture research.'
30,143,Lauren,"Basically. And it's part of why I get really excited about it. When my students ask questions, I say, 'That is genuinely a good question, and we'd love to know.'"
30,144,Gretchen,'No one has ever answered it yet.'
30,145,Lauren,"'You might be the person who answers this question or helps us move slightly forward towards it.' Because we have some very narrow contexts in which we know different languages use different elements of gesture to help increase communication. There's this lovely paper by Joe Blythe, that I'll also link to along with everything else I've talked about so far, about a language called Murrinhpatha in the Northern Territory of Australia. This is a language that has relatively few directional words."
30,146,Gretchen,Okay.
30,147,Lauren,"But when you look at how people talk about different locations, they use so many really rich directional gestures that in many ways, if you were taking a very narrow frame of mind, you might say, 'Well, this language is missing all these words.' But if you take a broader few of language and gesture, the language is completely capable of doing everything that English does, it just uses gestures for some of the things that English will use spoken words for."
30,148,Gretchen,"So instead of saying, as much, 'right' and 'left,' and 'north' and 'south,' and stuff like that, they'll more likely to use gestures for stuff like that?"
30,149,Lauren,Yeah.
30,150,Gretchen,"And if people are retelling other people's stories or something, they'll do it the same -- that information is passed along?"
30,151,Lauren,"That information can be retained, yeah. And there are some languages -- so English is very -- we remember things in terms of 'north' and 'south,' usually -- [Gretchen gives Lauren a look] in terms of 'left' and 'right,' usually, definitely not in terms of 'north' and 'south.'"
30,152,Gretchen,[holds up hands to either side of herself] You can see my confusing gesture there.
30,153,Lauren,"For many people who have got themselves completely lost while trying to read a map. But for English speakers we kind of remember things as 'left' or 'right.' In other cultures -- Murrinhpatha isn't necessarily one of the ones that's been well-studied for this -- but other languages of Australia tend to do all their directions around 'north,' 'south,' 'east,' and 'west.' So I'd be sitting to the 'north' of you. You're sitting to the 'south' of me. And then when you're telling --"
30,154,Gretchen,My south foot and my north foot?
30,155,Lauren,"Yeah, and so whenever you're telling a story, they'll -- instead of orienting it -- not matter which direction I sit, I'm always gonna do that [gestures a sweeping motion from her left to right] left to right for 'from you, to me.' Whereas, a speaker of one of these languages will always gesture from south to north, regardless of what direction they're sitting in."
30,156,Gretchen,That's so neat.
30,157,Lauren,"Again, each time we gesture, we're bringing extra information into the discourse that we might not have from speech, but that is also influenced by the culture and the language that we speak as well."
30,158,Gretchen,"So we've mentioned that a lot of people have mostly studied European languages and gesture, but you have not. You have studied other languages beyond Europe in gesture."
30,159,Lauren,"Yes, so I started -- after that initial, like, 'Wow! This field is really interesting,' the first thing I did was some work with English speakers, a little paper looking at just how likely people are to pay attention to particular gestures. So we've talked about the kinds of things you do to represent actions or movements in the real world, but there are all kinds of other gestures as well. We haven't talked about pointing gestures very much. We haven't talked about the very metaphoric gestures that are not grounded in the physical world. We haven't even talked about the gestures that have really specific names and we all recognise like the 'peace sign' or the 'thumbs up.'"
30,160,Gretchen,"I mean, you teach a whole course on gesture, so I think we could do '17 hours later...'"
30,161,Lauren,"Yes, so we've just focused on this set. But I was really interested in whether people remembered emblems more -- those 'thumbs up' and those 'peace sign' ones -- because they have really clear names. Or if people pay attention to pointing because we often think of pointing as being kind of simple --"
30,162,Gretchen,The prototypical gesture.
30,163,Lauren,"-- prototypical. So that was some early work I did with English speakers that showed the kinds of things that we study in gesture studies people seem to treat as different from then again other phenomena like facial gestures, or the kinds of the things we do unintentionally like coughing, or those kinds of things. So there's these whole other things that we can do with our bodies that we also have to think about in terms of these studies but aren't always directly relevant. So that was --"
30,164,Gretchen,"That was the first gesture thing you did. And you also went to Nepal and did a bunch of -- I mean, you did stuff with language in Nepal. Wrote a grammar or two."
30,165,Lauren,"Yeah, so then, again, under the very good influence of Barb Kelly, went and did fieldwork in Nepal. And I looked at the grammar and spent some time focusing on that. And then I, finally, in the last few years, got to come back to gesture and look what's happening with gesture in those languages, which is really exciting."
30,166,Gretchen,"What is happening with gesture? Not that you can say it all now, but is there something that's happening that's --"
30,167,Lauren,"There's so much to ask, and it's great that we have a really rich corpus of gesture recordings and general recordings that I can now use to study gesture."
30,168,Gretchen,So you've got a whole bunch of videos you're now poring through?
30,169,Lauren,"Yes, and it's a nice mix of -- they do things that are very specific to those stories that they're telling, and they help them tell the stories. But they're also the kinds of gestures that we see cropping up in other languages as well and part of what appears to be a set of things that humans tend to be likely to do. One of these is [holds both hands up in front of her, palms facing each other, then flicks the palms in towards her body] this gesture that gets made. It can be used without speech."
30,170,Gretchen,[Gestures the same] This kind of thing?
30,171,Lauren,"It's kind of a [gestures again] -- without speech, it's a very prominent flicking up, a bit of a shrug, and it's a like [gestures again, with shrug] 'What are you gonna do about it?'"
30,172,Gretchen,Okay.
30,173,Lauren,"Fatalistic. But the fact that it can be used as a question -- it can just be a tiny flick of the wrist, where people, say, are asking a question or they're a bit unsure. Someone might be telling a story, and they're like [gestures again, but with right hand only] 'What do I say next?'"
30,174,Gretchen,Is it always two-handed? Do you get one-handed ones?
30,175,Lauren,"No, it can be one-handed. There's lots of variation. And you see it across the larger -- I look at it specifically how it's used by Syuba speakers, who speak a Tibetan language in Nepal. But we see this handshape used for questions cropping up all over Southeast Asia and in India and Pakistan and Nepal. And we also see it related to a lot of other -- [both gesture a shrug, hands up, palms up] palms up as question. I think a shrug is very familiar to English speakers. And so kind of looking at the very specifics of how it's done in this culture but thinking about it in terms of the larger --"
30,176,Gretchen,The larger family of shrug gestures?
30,177,Lauren,Yeah.
30,178,Gretchen,That's super neat.
30,179,Lauren,"Yeah, it's really great."
30,180,Gretchen,"Like the 'I have nothing in my hands, and I'm gonna show off how empty my hands are' or something."
30,181,Lauren,"Yeah, there's a whole set of arguments around why, across speakers of English and speakers of Syuba -- it's not a like a historical, related-language thing. It just seems to be something about the way humans think, and think about space, and how they use their hands."
30,182,Gretchen,Because we've all got the same -- mostly the same -- set of hands.
30,183,Lauren,Yeah.
30,184,Gretchen,We can do very similar things with them.
30,185,Lauren,"We all experience our little -- we talk about the 'meat puppets' sometimes. The way that these meat puppets move through space and time. We all kind of do the same thing, and we can draw on the same resources."
30,186,Gretchen,"That's really neat. I think that's what makes gesture studies super interesting. It's another way of looking at, not just the stuff that you can articulate outside, through your throat, which you can't always see unless you get a little camera or something going. Gestures are very there, and you can see what's going on with them."
30,187,Lauren,"You'll probably notice them for the next day, at least. You'll be paying attention to what everyone is doing with their hands."
30,188,Gretchen,"Have fun with that. We've both been there. It's a fun position to be in. Don't spy on people too hard, but maybe just a tiny bit. [Music]"

30,192,Gretchen,Stay lingthusiastic!
30,193,Lauren,Stay lingthusiastic! [Music]
31,1,Gretchen,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics! I'm Gretchen McCulloch, and I'm here with Dr. Ake Nicholas, who is a lecturer in linguistics at Massey University of New Zealand in Auckland and a speaker of Cook Islands Māori. Hello! Welcome!"
31,2,Ake,Hello!
31,3,Gretchen,Welcome to the show! I'm so pleased that we managed to make this line up with me being in Australia and you also visiting Australia. And so the Canadian and the New Zealander will be sitting in a room together talking about language and linguistics.
31,4,Ake,Very convenient.
31,5,Gretchen,So let's start with the question that we ask all our guests on Lingthusiasm -- how did you get into linguistics?
31,6,Ake,"Well, if you go back enough into my early life, I've got a quite cute life story about that. So my family heritage is from the Cook Islands, which we'll talk more about in a minute. And when I was a baby, my parents moved back there, and I lived there until I was about 6 years old, which was after I had started school. And so when we moved to New Zealand when I was about 6, I had a little bit of language-adjustment issues coming into an English-medium school, and cultural differences, and migration trauma, and all the rest of it. I got taken pity on by a teacher who wasn't my teacher, but she was another teacher in the school who was New Zealand Māori. And she pulled me aside one day and said, 'Oh, you know that your language is quite a lot like our language? Why don't you sing me a song and we talk about it?' And so I sang a song for her and we went through the things that were the same and the things that were different. And she told me how it worked in New Zealand Māori, and it was -- you know."
31,7,Gretchen,That's so lovely.
31,8,Ake,"At the age of 6, I was like 'Something very exciting is happening here with these languages and these things.' And I was also extremely grateful to her for doing this nice, kind thing and making me feel good about it and not feel stink about wanting to use a different language. 'Feel stink' -- that's quite a New Zealandism, isn't it?"
31,9,Gretchen,I guess so!
31,10,Ake,"At that tender age, I became aware of this thing about relationships between languages, and the powerfulness that using a different language makes in your social world, and all that kind of stuff. I was very meta-aware of it from a young age. Also, my parents were really involved in the Kōhanga Reo movement in New Zealand, which is the reasonably well-known language revitalisation method of language immersion preschools."
31,11,Gretchen,"Oh, is that the language nests?"
31,12,Ake,"Yeah. So that translates as 'language nest,' which is what they're called in other places now. Yeah. So that, as you may or may not know, got started in New Zealand with the Māori language revitalisation. My parents were part of that movement. Being aware about language and being aware about language revitalisation is something that was a very important narrative through my whole childhood."
31,13,Gretchen,Were you a kid in one of those language nests?
31,14,Ake,"Oh, I was a little bit too old for it, but my younger siblings were, yeah."
31,15,Gretchen,"Oh, that's so great."
31,16,Ake,"Yeah. I really think that Joshua Fishman wrote once -- he's a language revitalisation theorist whose work has been quite influential in the New Zealand context for language revitalisation. But he said that when he was a child, every day at the dinner table his father would ask the whole family, 'So what have you done to support the Yiddish language today?' So I feel like that was a similar thing for me in my childhood that was a very overt thing that was very, very important -- to be worrying about looking after our languages and doing whatever we could to do it."
31,17,Gretchen,Maybe just for people who haven't heard of the language nests -- how does that work?
31,18,Ake,"It's just like a normal preschool, or 'early childhood education' as we call it -- so kids, before they go to primary school, or 'elementary school' as it's called in other places -- and that's, in theory, entirely conducted, in our case, in Māori -- all the talking, and all the teaching, and all the songs, and not just the language, but the cultural practices, and all of that kind of thing."
31,19,Gretchen,"Yeah. The food, and going out on the land, and stuff like this."
31,20,Ake,"Yeah. And all that kind of stuff. And also you don't just go and leave your kids and never think about it, the parents and the whole family, the 'whanau' as we call it, are expected to be involved in their educational experience. And that's a useful thing for language revitalisation as well, because it's not just the 3- year-olds who are in there learning language, but the parents who maybe don't know and the grandparents who maybe do, which was the situation at the time then, worked together so that the whole family gets access to that learning, and it's very effective when it's resourced enough to be put in practice."
31,21,Gretchen,"Yeah. Because you can see if you've only run this for a year, then you've got a bunch of 1-year-olds who can say two or three words, and you've gotta keep going so they can keep doing it for a number of years and become really fluent speakers because that's how most people become fluent speakers, is being exposed to it from their parents, and their grandparents, and stuff like this. It's creating a very natural environment, but doing it with a lot of deliberate planning to think about 'Here's how you can actually make an environment happen where you don't just let English take over.'"
31,22,Ake,"Yes, exactly. And a context like in New Zealand where, like in most English-speaking places, most of the people are monolingual and only speak English, and English is very, very dominant in all spheres of life. And where we had a situation in New Zealand, in the New Zealand Māori context, where there was a time where the language didn't get transmitted to the children. The people who were my parent's generation, the ones we call the 'Baby Boomers,' most of them didn't learn Māori when they were children. In the early '80s when this Kōhanga Reo language nest thing was starting up, the parents didn't speak, or could understand but didn't speak -- were 'passively bilingual,' as we call that -- but there were grandparents alive who still did. That process made use of those family members that were available to make it work. And the children learning that language in turn facilitate that parent generation learning the language, and that was the model that got deliberately made that way."
31,23,Gretchen,"The parents can be kind of less intimidated to learn because they only have to learn at the pace of a child, which is maybe just a few words at a time. And they have all that tolerance for error at that point."
31,24,Ake,"Exactly. Exactly. That happened in quite a grand scale in the early to mid-1980s in New Zealand, and it's still going strong today. That method has spread to other parts of the world -- Hawaii, for example. Another really successful place where they've instigated that is in Wales with the revitalisation of the Welsh language. They are doing great there with their language revitalisation, and that's starting out doing the same the sort of system."
31,25,Gretchen,"So you had language on your brain, on your mind, constantly from when you were a kid?"
31,26,Ake,Yeah. Heavily indoctrinated from a young child -- yeah.
31,27,Gretchen,"And then what made you say, 'Okay. So here's this language revitalisation thing' -- how did academic linguistics enter the picture?"
31,28,Ake,"When I was in my second year of university, some people said, 'You should take that linguistics paper. It's really easy.'"
31,29,Gretchen,Was it really easy?
31,30,Ake,"Um, sort of. But I went along and took this linguistics course and suddenly realised that there was a lot of really interesting, exciting things in that broad area that caught my attention, and so I carried on, which I think is a fairly common story, isn't it?"
31,31,Gretchen,I think it's a pretty common story -- yeah.
31,32,Ake,"And, yeah. Quite early in the -- the side of that was what I wanted to study. I learnt that my language, which is Cook Islands Māori, wasn't properly described yet, linguistically. I knew that that was what I was eventually gonna have to do once I got enough training to know how to do it. There was sort of a bigger-than-me kind of social motivation."
31,33,Gretchen,"Yeah. And to distinguish it from New Zealand Māori, which is different?"
31,34,Ake,Yes. Yeah. So do you wanna talk about that now?
31,35,Gretchen,"Yeah, I guess, let's."
31,36,Ake,"Okay. Mostly I've been talking about New Zealand Māori when I was talking about the language nests and all that kind of thing. That's the famous language from New Zealand. It's usually just called 'Māori.' But it's not actually the only indigenous language that is associated with the nation state of New Zealand. The nation state of the New Zealand is a different phenomenon to what people maybe think of when they think of New Zealand, which is the North Island and the South Island and the sort of main part of New Zealand."
31,37,Gretchen,But there's some other islands?
31,38,Ake,"Yes. There's other parts of what is actually -- so the legal entity of the nation state of New Zealand is something called the 'Realm of New Zealand.' That includes New Zealand proper, which is the bit people are mostly thinking about with the North Island and the South Island just off the east coast of Australia -- the 'West Island' as we sometimes call it."
31,39,Gretchen,"Wait, Australia is the 'West Island'?"
31,40,Ake,Yeah. It's the West Island. So we've got the North Island and the South Island and the West Island -- yeah.
31,41,Gretchen,I like this.
31,42,Ake,"Yeah. But there's actually other bits. There's the Cook Islands, which has 15 islands in it and a few languages. There's the island of Niue, which is in West Polynesia near Tonga and the Islands of Tokelau, which is up by Samoa. They all have people and languages which come from there. All of those languages, which is quite a few, are technically indigenous to this legal entity of the Realm of New Zealand, which is a different concept to 'Aotearoa,' which is the Māori word for the Māori nation, which only has one language, which is Māori."
31,43,Gretchen,And that is what's also known as 'New Zealand Māori?'
31,44,Ake,Yeah. Also known as 'New Zealand Māori.'
31,45,Gretchen,"So Aotearoa has a language, which is spoken on the North Island and the South Island?"
31,46,Ake,Yeah.
31,47,Gretchen,And then there are these other languages?
31,48,Ake,Yeah. Other different languages.
31,49,Gretchen,Other different languages -- right. Okay.
31,50,Ake,Yeah. And they have a confusing thing -- or our two in particular had the confusing thing of having the same name.
31,51,Gretchen,Yeah. So is that also the case in the language?
31,52,Ake,"Yes. So in the language, if you were calling the language by its name, both groups would call their language 'Māori' or 'te reo māori.'"
31,53,Gretchen,But there are differences when you actually look at the words?
31,54,Ake,"But they are different languages. They're not mutually intelligible. They're 400 years apart in history and so on. But they happen to have the same name and come from the same place, and the people are culturally fairly similar and look the same as each other, and it's a bit confusing."
31,55,Gretchen,"At one point, they were probably the same language, and they split apart and stopped talking to each other as much?"
31,56,Ake,"Yeah. In the migration of Polynesia, the Southern Cook Islands is probably where most of the people who are the Māori people of New Zealand came from, and that part of the migration is the Southern Cook Islands and the Society Islands, or Southern French Polynesia. That's the immediate jump-off point in that final migration to what's now on New Zealand or Aotearoa. That happened about 800 years ago."
31,57,Gretchen,Which is plenty of time for languages to diverge from each other.
31,58,Ake,"Absolutely -- plenty of time. There hasn't been ongoing contact between those two groups for about 400 years. So there's about 400 years of definitely no contact between those two languages. But, indeed, that is plenty of time to become a different language."
31,59,Gretchen,Which even 400 years is plenty of time to be --
31,60,Ake,"Plenty, plenty."
31,61,Gretchen,Yeah. 400 years ago is like Shakespeare. That's quite different.
31,62,Ake,Yes. Exactly. Exactly. And here's my example.
31,63,Gretchen,"Yeah. And 800 years ago is like Chaucer or older than Chaucer, which is really very different."
31,64,Ake,It's entirely a differently language -- incomprehensible.
31,65,Gretchen,We can definitely link to some sort of map of this linguistic situation with the islands because I am definitely a stranger to this part of the world and cannot picture most of this.
31,66,Ake,A map is useful.
31,67,Gretchen,There's a language map we could probably link to?
31,68,Ake,Yeah.
31,69,Gretchen,"Okay. Make sure to check out the show notes afterwards. Good. So there's these languages. And you at age 20 or so were like 'Here's my language, which has not been described very well. I wanna write some descriptions of it or make some stuff in it'?"
31,70,Ake,"Yeah. So, yes, eventually. I was a bit older than 20 but..."
31,71,Gretchen,Young Ake was like 'Here's what we're gonna do.'
31,72,Ake,"Yeah. I learnt how to be a descriptive linguist. For my PhD, I did what's known as a 'description and documentation' of my language, which is southern Cook Islands Māori. The documentation side involves collecting lots of examples of language, whether that's written stuff, or video, or audio -- as many different kinds of it as you can -- and then writing it all down and making it useable for the other side of it."
31,73,Gretchen,The translating it and transcribing it and annotating of what everything's doing.
31,74,Ake,"It's an extremely laborious, time-consuming process. And then the description part, sometimes this is called 'writing the grammar.' That's where you describe how the language works, right, from how the sounds work, to how you make words, and how you make sentences, and even how you have conversations. Although, I didn't get time to do much of that in my PhD because that's the hard part."
31,75,Gretchen,"Did you end up having to write a dictionary for it as well? Or were you like 'No, I didn't think to do that.'"
31,76,Ake,"We're fortunate in that we already had some good dictionaries. A lotta people when they're doing a documentation project on a previously undescribed language, that's an important first thing that they need to do is they need to collect as many of the words and make a dictionary. But I was lucky that we actually had that resource already. That made it easier."
31,77,Gretchen,Yeah. For sure.
31,78,Ake,Yeah. It was also easier that I already spoke the language.
31,79,Gretchen,"You didn't have to do that, 'Okay. So... does anybody here wanna talk to me?'"
31,80,Ake,Yeah.
31,81,Gretchen,"You didn't have to do the, 'I'm gonna sit with the speaker and record them and ask them 'Can you say this word? Can you say this word?'' You're just sitting with yourself and a recorder -- or I guess friends and family at this point as well."
31,82,Ake,"Yeah. More that one. I tried not to do too, too much recording of myself because my language is corrupted by too much exposure to New Zealand Māori."
31,83,Gretchen,"Oh, okay."
31,84,Ake,"I don't have a good, authentic Cook Islands way of talking because I spent most of my childhood in the New Zealand Māori context, so I speak a funny mix of New Zealand Māori sounds and Cook Islands Māori sounds, and it's all muddled up and funny so I -- especially for sound-based things, for phonological stuff -- I didn't wanna use me because I was compromised."
31,85,Gretchen,"You wanna make sure you're accurately representing what everyone else is doing and not the individual situation in your own head, which I'm sure is very interesting but maybe less relevant to a broader group of people."
31,86,Ake,"Yeah. It's not so much the content of what I was saying, I'm talking about the..."
31,87,Gretchen,"Oh, the actual sounds that you're saying."
31,88,Ake,"Especially stress. Because there're different systems, and I do it the New Zealand Māori way by intuition most of the time -- yeah."
31,89,Gretchen,So you're recording friends and family and doing this. Fast forward to today. You teach at a university about linguistics and Māori or some sort of combination of the two?
31,90,Ake,"Yes. Yes, all of those things. I teach linguistics. So just the normal 'How do languages work in a broad way?' and the little, different subsections of languages and how they work and, in particular, Pacific languages and the relationship between Pacific languages. And then also I'm involved in some language teaching for both of those languages -- for Cook Islands Māori and New Zealand Māori."
31,91,Gretchen,You're doing revitalisation-type projects? Or I guess is it kind of 'revitalisation' at this point if you've had this successful program since the 1980s?
31,92,Ake,"Well, two different contexts here, but in both cases, the answer's still yes. In New Zealand, a lot of resources have gone into looking after the Māori language and to revitalising and building up and all of that kind of thing, but it's still classified as endangered, and most of our kids are still not speaking, and most of our kids are still not in Māori-medium schools. Most people in New Zealand still don't speak Māori. And as a general rule, most Māori people in New Zealand would quite like it if everybody in New Zealand spoke Māori all the time and that was the language that we all used, which is a bit of a difference between some of the contexts in North America about how things work but -- yeah."
31,93,Gretchen,"Yeah. Because there was this thing with your prime minister who was like, 'I'm gonna send my kid to a Māori-speaking school,' and she's not Māori, but she was making this political statement of like, 'This is the type of thing that is a very popular thing to do.'"
31,94,Ake,"Yes. And that was received positively by almost everybody -- that suggestion that she made. That doesn't work like that in other parts of the world where other indigenous peoples' languages, those people don't necessarily think it's appropriate for outsiders to use their language. Whereas, in the New Zealand context, partly because, essentially, contrasting to what I said earlier, there's only one language to worry about as far as people think. That language is associated with that place. This is often the case with indigenous languages. And if you're gonna be in that place --"
31,95,Gretchen,You should speak that language.
31,96,Ake,-- it would be best if you were operating in that language -- yeah. That goal is still a little way off. But there's a pretty positive attitude toward Māori in New Zealand at the moment.
31,97,Gretchen,And there's a few phrases that have made their way into New Zealand English from Māori even if they're not the whole language.
31,98,Ake,"Yeah. Well, quite a lot, really. I heard someone say recently that the most unique thing about New Zealand English is the Māori words that are in it -- and the KIT vowel, I suppose."
31,99,Gretchen,The vowels are also very interesting too. But the most obvious unique thing about it is that there are a bunch of words from Māori.
31,100,Ake,"Other varieties of English have 'this and that' vowel, but no other varieties of English have all these Māori words. And there's a lot. It's not just a few, it's hundreds of words or phrases or expressions from, obviously, place names, and flora and fauna names, and names of animals and plants and things, but also lots of words for other parts of life -- kinship words, cultural concept words, greetings -- for example."
31,101,Gretchen,"Yeah. I watched a New Zealand YouTuber once, and she was definitely not Māori, and she just started her channel with 'kia ora, everybody. Blah blah blah.' And I was like 'I have never heard this.' I had to go look it up. And it was like 'Oh, it's from Māori.'"
31,102,Ake,"Yeah. 'kia ora,' which just means 'hello,' I think probably you could categorise that as having been a long time ago actually become part of English. That's an everyday greeting that almost anyone -- there's nobody in New Zealand who wouldn't understand it."
31,103,Gretchen,"This wasn't a video about the language context or anything like that, she was just doing a video about her life, and this is what occurred to her to say."
31,104,Ake,"I mean, that hasn't always been in the case. It was actually -- this is an iconic story about one of the things that triggered off activism for revitalising the Māori language. As recently as 1984..."
31,105,Gretchen,Very recent.
31,106,Ake,"Well, depends on how old you are, but on a human scale -- very recent, a generation or so ago -- an incident happened where a Māori woman got in trouble, and I think she'd even got threatened with getting fired, for answering the phone at her job at the post office by saying, 'kia ora,' which is how we say 'hello.' She got in trouble for it, and she, quite rightly, decided that that was an unacceptable thing to get in trouble for. That was the sort of starting off point for some of the more invigorated activism to promote the use of the Māori language in the public space in New Zealand, not just in the Māori context. But, yeah, in 1984, which is quite recent, it was like 'Oh, you can't say 'kia ora' on the phone.'"
31,107,Gretchen,"And now, everyone's saying it, and no one's thinking anything of it."
31,108,Ake,"Yeah. I mean, it's not absolutely considered to be wonderful. There is a little corner of the grumpy old men who are like 'What are you talking that language on the radio for? I can't even understand it. Blah blah blah.' But mostly, people just laugh at them."
31,109,Gretchen,"Yeah. Yeah. It kind of reminds me of -- I was in Hawaii a couple years ago, and everyone says, 'aloha' and 'mahalo' and things like that. That's just part of how people talk. They don't realise that people might not know, who aren't from there, what 'mahalo' means or something like this."
31,110,Ake,"Yeah. Yeah, exactly."
31,111,Gretchen,"Okay. So that was New Zealand Māori, which has got this quite established linguistic situation. Cook Islands Māori is different?"
31,112,Ake,"Yeah. In the Cook Islands context, I quite often say that we're a generation behind the New Zealand context. Cook Islands is, as we mentioned before, not part of mainland New Zealand and, constitutionally, the Cook Islands' arrangement with New Zealand is that they are internally self-governing in free-association with New Zealand. That means the Cook Islands has their own government that make the laws inside the Cook Islands, but anything dealing with the rest of the world, like the United Nations, or if we decide to invade the United States -- or, I shouldn't say that, military-related things, international affairs -- is still operated by New Zealand. Everybody in the Cook Islands is a New Zealand citizen and has a New Zealand passport. It's an interesting constitutional arrangement, which was copied by the Federated States of Micronesia in relation to the United States. They have the same constitutional arrangement with the United States, different from some of the other United States territories, but -- yeah. And that applies to the Cook Islands, Niue, and Tokelau."
31,113,Gretchen,And each of those are individually self-governing?
31,114,Ake,"Yeah. Niue is the same as us, more or less, the same as the Cook Islands. Tokelau is a little bit more New Zealand -- not even separate at all."
31,115,Gretchen,Right. And so it's a generation behind in the linguistic situation as well?
31,116,Ake,"Yeah. Because, as is the case in most of the world, places that are in the tropics, even if they got momentarily colonised by European people, the European people didn't stay there, which is a pattern that's happened around the world."
31,117,Gretchen,Didn't like the climate as much?
31,118,Ake,It's a bit too hot for them -- that's right.
31,119,Gretchen,"A bit too hot for me, I should say."
31,120,Ake,"So, unlike in New Zealand, where the majority of the population -- 70-something percent -- still is 'Pakeha,' which is our word for the New Zealand people of European decent, in the Cook Islands, it's majority indigenous population and always has been. That protected that population from the language loss for longer until about the 1980s when one thing that happened was the airport got made big enough to take the big jumbo jets, which increased the number of English-speaking tourists who came and increased the ease of contact with the English-speaking world. And also another thing that happened was TV broadcasts started then, which is all in English. These things happened, which led to, what we call in sociolinguistics, a 'shift' towards English and away from Māori, the community language. But that didn't start happening until the mid-1980s. When I was a child in the early '80s going to school in the Cook Islands, all the kids spoke Māori to each other."
31,121,Gretchen,Right. Pretty much everything was just in Māori.
31,122,Ake,"Māori was the normal language, the 'lingua franca' as it gets called -- the normal language that people use for everything. People knew English as well but would prefer to use Māori for most things."
31,123,Gretchen,"And if you'd go to the post office, or the grocery store, or something, everything's in Māori?"
31,124,Ake,"Yeah. And, importantly, at school the language of instruction is Māori. But around that time, in the mid-to-late '80s, that started shifting, including the language of instruction in schools. Now, the language of instruction in school is predominantly English in most places."
31,125,Gretchen,"This language shift that had happened in New Zealand before the '80s, is now happening in the Cook Islands in the '80s and '90s?"
31,126,Ake,"Yeah. Now, we're in the situation that -- probably the situation in the Cook Islands now is probably the equivalent of the situation in New Zealand in the early '80s when people noticed there was a problem, and made the Kōhanga Reo, and all that kind of stuff."
31,127,Gretchen,"So at this point, the parent generation currently doesn't necessarily speak Māori, but the grandparents still do?"
31,128,Ake,"Yes, that's right. Yeah, exactly. The grandparent generation -- still speakers. The parents -- some still do but mostly not. And the kids -- definitely, mostly not, especially in Rarotonga, which is the most populous island in the Cook Islands, and in New Zealand proper, where most Cook Islands people live because, from what I said before, Cook Islanders are New Zealand citizens, so just with the general habits that have been happening with humans in the last hundred years or so urbanisation and so on, and moving to the big cities for work -- most Cook Islands people, like two-thirds, live in New Zealand."
31,129,Gretchen,"Oh, so a lot of people moved to New Zealand as well?"
31,130,Ake,Yeah. That is a prohibitive factor for language maintenance.
31,131,Gretchen,Right. Of course.
31,132,Ake,Makes it harder to keep speaking your community language.
31,133,Gretchen,"Yeah. There's a question of, 'Well, if you're a Cook Islands Māori person, you've gotta send your kid to a New Zealand Māori school because they're gonna learn wrong Māori for them.'"
31,134,Ake,"Well, yes. And that is a thing that happens because there's almost no Cook Islands Māori equivalents that you can do in New Zealand. There's a few little 'Punanga Reo,' which is what we call the Kōhanga Reo. It's the same concept. There's fewer of them, but not heaps and heaps. There's no Cook Islands language-medium schools in New Zealand. So, yeah. A lot of Cook Islands kids do actually go through the New Zealand Māori system because parents are taking the choice. They say, 'Oh, well, we can't have our one. We'll have the next best thing.' That's probably a good thing because that's still getting some of those basic systems into those kids at a young age."
31,135,Gretchen,"Yeah. It's still a related language, so it will make it easier if they're adults to try to learn the one that's actually theirs. Or at least they're closer in culture because they did have this common historical connection 800 years ago."
31,136,Ake,"Exactly. Relations between those two groups are generally amicable -- more than that, actually -- friendly. We're a close family."
31,137,Gretchen,So that's the situation with Cook Islands Māori. It's more complicated and there's less stuff going on.
31,138,Ake,"At the moment, Cook Islands Māori is more endangered than New Zealand Māori, which seems surprising because people think, 'Oh, there they are in the Cook Islands. They're okay. They don't have the English problem with the English-speaking people forcing a shift to English that happened in New Zealand a hundred years ago.' But because this modern world and globalisation, the effect has eventually still happened. And now we're in that crisis point where we've stopped our intergenerational transmission in most places. This is a dangerous thing because it doesn't really matter how many speakers you've got, if your children aren't learning --"
31,139,Gretchen,"In a hundred years, they're not gonna be around -- or 20 years, even, if their speakers are getting older."
31,140,Ake,"Yeah. As soon as Nana dies, right? It can happen really fast -- yeah."
31,141,Gretchen,"I mean, it seems like, 'Oh, we've got thousands of speakers,' but if they're all over 60, then that's a really unstable situation."
31,142,Ake,"That's right. Exactly. In the Cook Islands context, that's where we are, which is a more perilous stage. And because we're a smaller language, and we don't have this status as being --"
31,143,Gretchen,The prime minister's not trying to learn your language.
31,144,Ake,That's right. That's right. Jacinda Ardern is not teaching her baby Neve how to speak Cook Islands Māori.
31,145,Gretchen,Maybe she should.
31,146,Ake,"Well, she could definitely do both at once, right, because babies can do that. They're really good at learning languages -- closely related ones, different ones, all of them. But, yeah, because there isn't that institutional support in the New Zealand context, where most Cook Islands people are, there isn't a lot of resources for trying to do things to help the revitalisation."
31,147,Gretchen,"Right. You're doing some interesting things with respect to 'Okay, there's this TV coming in. Well, if the kids wanna watch the TV, let's give them the TV, but in Cook Islands Māori.'"
31,148,Ake,"Yeah. So one of the problems that we're having with our language revitalisation endeavours that we -- the people of the Cook Islands, the older people who are speakers -- are having, is a problem that is experienced in lots of language revitalisation contexts where we can sometimes, or often, have trouble gathering up our target, which is our young people -- our children and our young people -- because something about the traditional way that you try and do it isn't attractive to them."
31,149,Gretchen,They don't always wanna go off with their grandparents and learn traditional things. They wanna be on their iPads or whatever.
31,150,Ake,"Yeah. I try to not say it quite as deficit as that. The common thing is like 'Oh, that kid's just interested in their phones, and they don't wanna know about our traditional things, and they're just interested in modern life and computer games.' That's the anti-child position."
31,151,Gretchen,That's the gripe version of that.
31,152,Ake,"Yeah. I try to say that a lot of our young people are quite insecure about their language skills and about their cultural skills because, along with that stopping learning the language, another thing that just automatically happens -- well, not automatically, but often is associated with that -- is you also haven't learnt all these important cultural things too. That can be quite a shameful sort of feeling for people in that situation, that they're too shy to try and do all of that stuff at once because it's all really hard because, as we all know, trying to learn a language when you're not 2 years old is really hard."
31,153,Gretchen,"And if you show up and your grandparents or elders are shaming you for not doing it right, and also not knowing how to fish right, or also not knowing how to cook right, or do the other traditional cultural practices right, then everything's bad, and you're bad at this, so you just might as well just not even come."
31,154,Ake,"Exactly. Right? That's pushing the blame where it actually belongs -- onto the old people. Sorry, Nana."
31,155,Gretchen,"I mean, I guess it's the old people that want the young people to come, and so if they want to bring the young people in, they've gotta figure out how to make it enticing for them."
31,156,Ake,"Yeah. This is a little bit of a point of tension in our context, and I think this is why it's big in lots of other contexts where people are having this issue. One thing that I try to do in my encouraging language-learning practice -- or language teaching practice -- is to, instead of putting the pressure to learn all these important traditional things and learn this language as a 12-year-old or a 20-year-old when it's as hard as learning any other random thing, that I get the students to try to talk about their phones, and their iPads, and the movies, and their favourite movie stars, and talk about the stuff that they feel culturally secure talking about, and the things that they're interested in, and things that they -- it's not so much the interest side of it, because I think they are often interested in the traditional things --"
31,157,Gretchen,The things that they're already familiar with.
31,158,Ake,"-- but the things they feel confident engaging with, where they feel confident or, even in a lotta cases, excited. You ask people to talk about Beyoncé, and they get very excited, and have a lot of things to say, and they have good feelings when they do that. And so all those good feelings will flow onto the feelings associated with learning the language. And instead of being stressed and worried, they'll be like 'Oh, I'm thinking about Beyoncé and learning how to do this kind of sentence.'"
31,159,Gretchen,Rather than have two sources of tension at once.
31,160,Ake,"Exactly. Exactly. Taking away one of those sources of tension and trying to trick them that the other one isn't that hard either. It seems quite a feat, at least for their happiness -- they're happier when they're doing it."
31,161,Gretchen,"Well, that's a big part of language-learning, you need to feel okay about doing it."
31,162,Ake,Exactly. Exactly.
31,163,Gretchen,"You had students make videos about, was it, Harry Potter in Cook Islands Māori?"
31,164,Ake,"Yeah, well, those students made the Harry Potter thing themselves. I was surprised because I would've thought that Harry Potter's a little bit old these days, but apparently everyone still likes it. I don't know."
31,165,Gretchen,"I guess so. I don't know. I still like Harry Potter, I guess."
31,166,Ake,Right.
31,167,Gretchen,They wanted to retell the basic theme of the story of Harry Potter?
31,168,Ake,"Well, not quite, not quite. I mean, I've got a whole series of these Tampiritoa videos -- that's the Cook Islands Māori way of saying 'Dumbledore' -- which you can put a link to on here. They just made that up themselves. I have this method I use in-person, the face-to-face classroom, where I have a big box of toys that I get them to with play with. They act out stories and do stuff. They just decided one time, several years ago, that one of these particular doll-figurines was Dumbledore. And they called him 'Tampiritoa' and just injected that Harry Potter stuff into the story. It wasn't like they were retelling Harry Potter, they just sort of mish-mashed it with Harry Potter and whatever --"
31,169,Gretchen,Whatever the other figurines were.
31,170,Ake,What do they call it? 'Mash-up?'
31,171,Gretchen,Yeah. This is definitely Harry Potter fanfiction.
31,172,Ake,"Yeah. Well, yes."
31,173,Gretchen,Much more than Harry Potter retelling.
31,174,Ake,Yes. That's more accurate -- yes. The original one started off -- I called it a Harry Potter/Whale Rider crossover. Do you know the film The Whale Rider?
31,175,Gretchen,Not really. But I guess it's about whales and people who ride them?
31,176,Ake,"Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's quite a good film. It's about the Ewe, a people on the east coast of the North Island of New Zealand who their migration story involves their ancestor Paikea, coming to Aotearoa, coming to New Zealand, on a whale. It's a story set in that community. It's good. I recommend it. Interestingly, that person, Paikea, comes from Mauke, which is the island that I'm from in the Cook Islands, so we've got the other end of that story. In their story, it's like 'He arrives on Tolaga Bay on the...'"
31,177,Gretchen,And you guys are like 'He leaves...'
31,178,Ake,"Yeah. We've got the leaving part of the story, which in modern times, we've all reconnected with each other, and we all visit each other's places and all that kind of stuff. It was pretty sweet. So, yeah, Paikea, who is the whale rider, comes from Mauke. Back in Mauke, we've got a place, which is his wife, who's now stone because she waited so long for him to come back, and he never came back because he moved to Gisborne."
31,179,Gretchen,Then this is crossing over with Dumbledore?
31,180,Ake,"Oh, yeah. Sorry. Yeah. The story that they started off making was this mixture of those two things, and then it just sort of carried on because every time I teach that class, I say, 'Make a better story than those last lot did,' and so they just..."
31,181,Gretchen,"Oh, okay. People keep adding. This is a very collaborative universe, fanfiction sort of context."
31,182,Ake,"Yeah. It's gone a way -- if you walk through the sequence, it's gone in some different directions. The most recent one, which is a couple of years old now, is about Trump and that election and other such. It covers all kinds of contemporary life."
31,183,Gretchen,"Just various different aspects of this kind of thing. And then so once these videos are created, what happens to them afterwards? Can you use them again?"
31,184,Ake,"Yeah. The context I'm talking about here is the university language classroom with adults, and I make lots of little of these story videos as part of their process. But we just keep most of them in-house. The ones that they agree to, we put on YouTube so that everybody can watch them, and they can take it home, and show their Nana, and get told off for talking funny or whatever. Grandmothers are extremely important people in any family context."
31,185,Gretchen,It can lead to shared discussions between different generations about the topics that the kids are already paying attention to.
31,186,Ake,"Yeah. And it demonstrates to their peers, who maybe haven't had the chance to learn the language, that maybe if you did, you could talk about these kind of things, and it wouldn't just always be the serious, traditional things."
31,187,Gretchen,It kind of makes the language cool for younger people.
31,188,Ake,"Yeah. I've also done this thing where, in the small islands in the Cook Islands, the language is good. All the children there speak the language, and they use that language at school, and it's all thriving and wonderful. But there's 200 people on one island, and 60 people on one island, and 400 people on another. There's not many people there, but in that small population, it's thriving and doing really well."
31,189,Gretchen,There are kids in those small islands?
31,190,Ake,"Yeah. In those places there are kids who are super competent speakers of that language. And so another thing I've done along this line of stuff is, when I've been over there doing other stuff, I have got some of the actual young children, 6- to 10-year-olds, 6- to 12-year-olds -- primary school children -- to make little stories, little cartoon movies, and comic strips and things like that, which is fun for them because they get interested in literacy and their language and different modes of literacy, so it's good for them. But also what I'm after sort of more than that is then they make examples of cool kids' language that, if that goes into that collection, then the kids in New Zealand, which is most of our kids, can have access to other peer-language instead of only having old people to talk to. I love old people, but like..."
31,191,Gretchen,"It's important for them to know that this language is still in-use among kids their age and can be used by kids their age, and it's not just a grandma/grandpa thing that old people do, and it is something that can be part of their lives the way it's part of these other kids' lives."
31,192,Ake,Exactly -- to use that as a model and to give them the chance to hear how it sounds and copy them and try and be cool like them or whatever -- hopefully.
31,193,Gretchen,"That's really awesome. Thank you so much for coming on the show and talking to us. If there was one thing you could leave people knowing about the language or linguistics in general, what would that be?"
31,194,Ake,Okay. This one's kind of aimed at random people in New Zealand and linguists which is -- please stop calling Cook Islands Māori 'Rarotongan.'
31,195,Gretchen,'Rarotongan' is not the correct word for it?
31,196,Ake,"'Rarotongan' is not the right name for this language because 'Rarotongan' is the name for the specific variety that comes from Rarotonga, and everybody who doesn't come from Rarotonga doesn't like it when the whole language gets called 'Rarotongan.' And the Rarotonga people don't like it either because it's not accurate."
31,197,Gretchen,It's as if they're taking credit for the whole thing. That's one island of the 15 Cook Islands?
31,198,Ake,"Yes. That's right. It's the big one. It's the one that got used to translate the Bible and all that kind of stuff. So there's all these political tensions. But most Cook Islands people -- nearly everybody, I think -- don't like to have the whole language referred to by that name. Some people get a bit a muddled up. They're like 'Cook Islands Māori use English words,' and it's like 'Well, Rarotongan's not a Māori word either.' That's actually an anglicised --"
31,199,Gretchen,That's like an English ending.
31,200,Ake,Yeah. It's got an English ending on it. There is no Māori name for the whole group of islands because the group of islands was only put together by accident. It's not a historically or politically unified place.
31,201,Gretchen,It's a colonial construct of people coming in and calling them all something.
31,202,Ake,Yeah. There isn't a traditional name for that place because it's not a traditional place.
31,203,Gretchen,"There's an adapted version of the pronunciation of that that's in your Twitter handle though, right?"
31,204,Ake,Yeah. Sometimes we call it 'Te Reo Kūki 'Āirani.' But 'Kūki 'Āirani' is just the words 'Cook Islands' pronounced in a Māori way.
31,205,Gretchen,"Good. Cook Islands Māori, which will definitely be what we call it in the description for this episode -- you've never done any different, probably, most people who are listening to this, so you're already doing the right thing."
31,206,Ake,Yeah.

32,8,Gretchen,"So, if I say something like, 'Oh, my god! Harry got a new broomstick!'"
32,9,Lauren,This is obviously the world in which we are both associate professors at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
32,10,Gretchen,"They've introduced a linguistics course, what can I say? They brought us in to teach it."
32,11,Lauren,I'm so excited. That is definitely news. Harry has a new broomstick. Did you see the new broomstick? Is that how you know? Is why that why you're telling...
32,12,Gretchen,"Definitely one thing I could say would be, 'Yes! Yes, I saw it! It's great. It's a Nimbus 2000.' But another thing I can also say was, 'No. But I heard him flying on it, and it sounds fancier than his old one.'"
32,13,Lauren,"Right. In that case, you haven't seen it, but you've heard it. So, you know that there's a new one."
32,14,Gretchen,"Yeah. I know it's a new one. Broomsticks have a distinctive sound -- who knew? They definitely do. Or I could say, 'No. But Hermione told me.'"
32,15,Lauren,Obviously.
32,16,Gretchen,Because she knows everything.
32,17,Lauren,Because she knows everything -- yeah.
32,18,Gretchen,"Or I might say, 'No. I didn't see it, but I saw the packaging for it.' I knew that he'd gotten it. Or I could say, 'No. I didn't see it, but he left his old one in his room while he was at Quidditch practice, so I inferred that he must've gotten a new one.'"
32,19,Lauren,"Right. And in this case, your evidence is not as direct. You haven't got absolute proof. He may have just decided his was broken and he was gonna borrow a spare one."
32,20,Gretchen,"Right. Or maybe he got sick or something. Something could have definitely come up. Or I could be even less certain and say, 'No. But I read it in the tea leaves,' or, 'I saw it in a dream.'"
32,21,Lauren,You must be very good at divination.
32,22,Gretchen,"What can I say? It's one of my many talents. Or I might say, 'No. I didn't see it, but Harry gets a new broom every year -- or every book -- and so I've inferred that he must be getting a new one as well this year.'"
32,23,Lauren,Right -- based on kind of inferred evidence of habitual reality.
32,24,Gretchen,"Yeah. Normally, he gets a new broomstick. Harry got a new broomstick again."
32,25,Lauren,"All of these are different sources of evidence. You have different evidence to show that you believe this claim to be true. But you don't necessarily say that overtly. When people gossip, they do that all the time. All the time someone will be like 'Omg! This thing happened.' And you'll be like 'Oh, my god! Did you see that happen?' And then they'll be like 'Uh, no. I just heard about it.'"
32,26,Gretchen,"Yeah. 'Did you know that this person's been stealing all of the cookies from the cookie jar?' Like 'Wait, no, did you see them?' 'No, but they had crumbs on their shirt.' 'Oh! Maybe that was this person.'"
32,27,Lauren,Guilty.
32,28,Gretchen,Guilty as charged. I saw them sneaking out of the room with a suspicious look on their face. I like this Harry Potter example because it sets up a world where we can have this kind of gossip and we can make these kinds of inferences. But we do this all the time.
32,29,Lauren,"And when we do give more evidence, when we explain how we know it, like in all of those examples, in English we just have to add an extra phrase or some extra words. But this isn't the case for all languages. There are some languages where it's actually part of the grammatical system. You have to choose a grammatical form that explains how you know the information in the sentence that you're saying."
32,30,Gretchen,"In the same way that, in English, we need to choose a time when something happened anytime you say something. I can't just say, 'Harry get a new broomstick,' to mean, 'He got one,' or 'He will get one,' or 'He has one now,' 'He is getting one currently.' I have to pick between which of those kinds of getting he wants to. But in some languages, while you can specify the time by using words like 'yesterday' or 'tomorrow' or 'recently' or 'a long time ago,' you don't have to. In English, you have to specify when something happened."
32,31,Lauren,"It would be a bit like if we got a new suffix on a verb like 'got.' So, it's something like 'Harry got-saw a new broomstick' or 'Harry got-heard a new broomstick.' And you have to use that."
32,32,Gretchen,"That could mean, 'I saw that he got it' or 'I heard that he got it.'"
32,33,Lauren,"Yeah. It's not a particularly attractive -- I feel like we could definitely find a nicer way of putting that into our grammar if we wanted to, but that's a very crude example."
32,34,Gretchen,I feel like I'd like to make some sort of shortened version of 'apparently' because I think I use 'apparently' a lot for like 'I'm not really confident about the source of this evidence.'
32,35,Lauren,'Harry got-apps.'
32,36,Gretchen,"Yeah. Like 'per' -- 'Harry per-got a new broomstick,' which could short for 'apparently' or something."
32,37,Lauren,I like that you're putting it as a prefix instead of a suffix.
32,38,Gretchen,"I don't think we have enough prefixes, grammatically, in English. I want some more prefixes."
32,39,Lauren,"No, you're right."
32,40,Gretchen,"I don't think that's how grammar works, but it's okay."
32,41,Lauren,"So, it can be a prefix. It can be a suffix. It could be a completely different form of the verb. In some languages, they're particles. But they're part of the grammar instead of being a word that you choose. This happens across -- the most inflated claim I've heard is that 25% of the world's languages have some form of grammatical evidentiality."
32,42,Gretchen,Wow!
32,43,Lauren,"A lot of those languages are very small language families and groups spoken in the Amazon, and in the Tibetan area, across Papua New Guinea, and the Balkans -- are kind of the four big areas people talk about. But you also find quite a few languages from North America. Very occasional languages in, say, Australia also have at least one grammatical evidential."
32,44,Gretchen,Yeah. I don't think I speak any languages that have evidential markers. But the European languages don't have to have them and those are most of the languages that I speak.
32,45,Lauren,"No. They're missing out, those European languages."
32,46,Gretchen,"You've done some research on evidentials, right?"
32,47,Lauren,"That is correct. My PhD thesis was all about evidentials in a Tibetan language spoken in Nepal called Yolmo. I was interested in understanding what different types of options they had for evidentiality but also how people choose to use them strategically in conversations -- so how people use them in that kind of gossipy context. Tibetan languages are interesting because, as well as all those categories we talked about in terms of the evidence for Harry's new broomstick, there's also an evidential form that Harry could use if he got a new broomstick."
32,48,Gretchen,'I got a new broomstick myself (I know it because it happened to me)?'
32,49,Lauren,Yeah. He wouldn't have to use something like 'I saw myself get a new broomstick.' That would be quite unusual.
32,50,Gretchen,It would be kind of weird -- yeah.
32,51,Lauren,"And in fact, he can use it. But if he used the form that's the equivalent of 'I saw it,' it would be kind of like an English form of 'Oh, I see I have a new broomstick!' It's new information. It's a bit unexpected."
32,52,Gretchen,Could you do that in something like 'Harry got me a new broomstick'? And so I'm directly involved in this -- I can see that he got it for me?
32,53,Lauren,"Yeah. Because it's an event you participated in. In some Tibetan languages it's really specific who you're allowed to talk about using this form. It's a bit more flexible in Yolmo. But it means that people have these options between something that they perceive either by sight or taste or smell or something that they know from their personal experience. There's also a form that you can use if you're less certain, which is less about evidence and more about just how certain you are. And one of my favourites, which is not used that often, but it's one that's like 'information that is so obvious everybody knows it.'"
32,54,Gretchen,Like 'It's daytime' or something?
32,55,Lauren,'Harry Potter is a wizard.'
32,56,Gretchen,"Right. Okay. Everyone knows this. They don't have to say, 'J.K. Rowling told me that Harry Potter is a wizard.'"
32,57,Lauren,"Yeah. A lot of the examples that I got from people are things like 'sugar is sweet,' 'lemons are sour.'"
32,58,Gretchen,Right.
32,59,Lauren,"Just, like, 'This is such obvious, general facts about the world.'"
32,60,Gretchen,"Or, 'This is the town we live in.'"
32,61,Lauren,Yeah.
32,62,Gretchen,Everyone knows we're in this town.
32,63,Lauren,"But even then, that's not a kind of -- I don't wanna say the 'universal' because that's a dangerous word -- but..."
32,64,Gretchen,It's not self-evident?
32,65,Lauren,"It's not as self-evident as something like 'Tea is tasty,' which is taken as a generally given fact. They also have a little particle that you can use to say that something is reported from somewhere else. And that's just 'ló.' When it comes to telling stories, when you've heard stuff from people, it would just be so efficient if you could just have a little 'ló' at the end when you're telling gossip."
32,66,Gretchen,Yeah. Because then you know this is still the story and you know that you're not taking credit for knowing it yourself directly.
32,67,Lauren,"Yeah. You're just passing on the gossip. So, those are the forms that I was looking at. I was looking at how people used them in things like reporting stories from other people but also in how you ask questions."
32,68,Gretchen,How do you use evidentials to ask questions?
32,69,Lauren,"It varies across different languages. Sometimes, you just use a base form or a neutral form or a question form. But in Tibetan languages, you use the form of the evidential that you think someone is gonna answer with. So, if I was gonna ask you, 'Did Harry get a new broom?' if you went to Quidditch practice a lot, I might ask you using the one for 'Did you see this directly?' 'Did you see Harry got a new broom?'"
32,70,Gretchen,"Right. Whereas, otherwise you might say, 'Did you hear whether Harry got a new broom?' or 'Did you hear that Harry got a new broom?' 'Do you think that...?' 'Can you infer that...?'"
32,71,Lauren,"Yeah. Or it's that time of year where Harry always breaks his broom and someone buys him a new one, I might use the 'Did Harry get a new broom as per the standard pattern of behaviour?'"
32,72,Gretchen,"Right. I mean, you can kind of do this if you really want to in English. You can say, 'Do you suppose Harry got a new broom again?' or 'Do you reckon Harry got a new broom?' But it's not obligatory -- yeah."
32,73,Lauren,"Yeah. The important thing about evidentials is not that it's impossible to do this in English, it's just because it's baked into the grammar --"
32,74,Gretchen,Right. You have to do it.
32,75,Lauren,"-- it crops up all the time. The cool thing is, because you have to use the evidential that you think someone's gonna use in their answer, you basically have to do this kind of context-reading prediction of what evidence you think they're gonna have, or what would be the best evidence to have for asking a particular question and getting particular information."
32,76,Gretchen,You end up taking on their perspective of 'What do I assume that this person likely knows?' or 'How do I assume that this person gets their information?'
32,77,Lauren,"Yeah. And the person doesn't have to answer -- if they don't have that level of evidence, they'll reply with something else. But it's a nifty interactional trick if you think about it."
32,78,Gretchen,Do you have to use the one that's the most certain of the pieces of evidence that you think they have?
32,79,Lauren,"No, you use the one that you think is the best fit."
32,80,Gretchen,The most likely -- okay.
32,81,Lauren,"Yeah. Certainty is complex because for a lot of things you might think that having direct -- that direct 'I saw' evidence is the best. But there are some situations where it would be rude to presume that I have that direct evidence. So, for example, if someone asked me if you were hungry -- they said, 'Is Gretchen hungry?' -- it would actually be rude for them to ask if I had direct evidence because the only direct evidence you have is your personal feeling of hunger. They would ask me using the reported-speech form or the less-direct form."
32,82,Gretchen,Like 'Did Gretchen tell you she was hungry?' or 'Do you infer Gretchen is probably hungry because you know it's been five hours since she ate?'
32,83,Lauren,"We have this idea that more direct evidence is good. It was interesting when we were building that list of examples, you were ordering them instinctively in a way that you saw as more-evidence, and more certain, and more direct from 'I saw it' to --"
32,84,Gretchen,"Yeah. Whereas, you're the one that's done the evidential literature, and I was like 'I just feel like these should go in an order.'"
32,85,Lauren,"That order pretty much matches up with what a lot of the literature says in terms of a hierarchy of evidence being better or higher-quality or something. But if you actually look at the interactional choices people make when they're chatting, sometimes it's better that you don't use something that's more certain or more direct because it's rude or presumptive."
32,86,Gretchen,"Yeah. Can you use this type of thing to be polite as well? If I say, 'I wonder if you could possibly open the window?' it's not that I'm actually wondering about your ability to open the window, it's more that I'm trying to make an indirect request. Can you use evidentials like that?"
32,87,Lauren,"There's definitely times where it's more appropriate to ask questions or to state things using more-direct evidence and there are times where it's better to state things using less-direct evidence. And in that case, politeness does come into it."
32,88,Gretchen,"This seems like the kind of question that people probably ask is 'Well, if you have evidentials, does that mean that people can't lie?' But surely people could use an evidential they don't actually have evidence for if they wanna lie, right?"
32,89,Lauren,"Yeah. I guess, you could potentially try and send people off track by using an inferred evidential when you actually witness something or vice versa. People can definitely use them. Just because they mark the source of evidence doesn't mean you have to always use the one that you definitely have evidence for."
32,90,Gretchen,"If I say that I saw you stealing the cookies from me, that doesn't actually mean that I actually saw it, it just means that I'm saying that I saw it."
32,91,Lauren,"Yeah. Or there's an anecdote in my thesis where I talk about going to a wedding with a bunch of people when I was doing field work. As they were going around servicing -- at a wedding you traditionally -- like any wedding across the world, it's the do you want the chicken or the fish? You feed people a lot of meat. And you feed them a lot of booze. And it's a big party. And one of the women, who was being very silly and joking around, and whenever they came around would say, 'She eats meat,' and would use the reported form to suggest that I had said that I eat meat. They're like, 'Oh, yeah. She eats meat. Oh, yeah, she drinks heaps,' which as a teetotaling vegetarian -- they know I'm a teetotaling vegetarian because they find it very funny. So, putting these words in my mouth was a big, hilarious joke for them. But they didn't honestly believe that I'd said that."
32,92,Gretchen,"Right, right, right. They were using that to make fun of you, as you do."
32,93,Lauren,"Yeah. The other really nifty example I have is there was a time where I agreed to something by nodding my head, which everyone understood. And then later someone was like 'Oh, she said 'Yes'' -- reported speech."
32,94,Gretchen,"Right. Whereas, the literal word you said wasn't 'Yes,' but..."
32,95,Lauren,"It's not a verbatim, court of law, 'This is exactly that you said.' It's a general intent reporting."
32,96,Gretchen,Are there cognitive effects of having evidentials? Do people remember source of information better or something?
32,97,Lauren,"I still personally haven't seen a study that really convinces me of that. But there's some really cute studies in children and how children acquire evidentiality. They've done this in Turkish and Tibetan, and the general indication is children can start using them relatively young, from like 3 or 4 years of age, but often when they're really young, they haven't entirely figured out what the evidentials are doing in terms of what they're marking. They tend to use them to indicate that they're more or less certain. Certainty is definitely tied up in things. If you saw Harry had a new broomstick, you would feel more certain about it than if there was some rubbish outside."
32,98,Gretchen,The packaging or whatever.
32,99,Lauren,"The kind of -- in the corridor. Because that packaging could technically belong to someone else even if no one else really rides broomsticks in that dormitory. But then, just because you have that direct evidence, it could still be wrong. Harry could be borrowing someone else's new broomstick. The literature on evidentiality often mentions that certainty is an inferred part of using particular evidentials, but it doesn't have to be. Children tend to latch onto this certainty idea when they first start using them and then they kind of refine what they're doing with them."
32,100,Gretchen,That's so cute. It reminds me of how children acquire numbers and time durations and stuff.
32,101,Lauren,"Ah, yeah. We talked about that in our time episode."
32,102,Gretchen,"Yeah. We talked about that children know that an hour is longer than a minute, but they don't know that one hour is longer than two minutes because maybe that's more."
32,103,Lauren,Two is a bigger number than one.
32,104,Gretchen,"Exactly. Or three minutes might be longer than two hours because -- oh, god. I dunno! They have some sense of the magnitudes, but they don't have exact computations to get them."
32,105,Lauren,Because children see their parents and other adult users of the languages using these evidentials in situations that seem more certain because it's right there. That's how they start using them.
32,106,Gretchen,"And children are often missing out on the type of social information that we've acquired to be like 'Well, actually I can infer this because I have this social information about what the package looks like that this comes in,' or 'I know who knows who's talked to who,' or something like that. Children are often missing this social information sometimes."
32,107,Lauren,That's a lot to keep in your head even as an adult.
32,108,Gretchen,"How does a language start getting evidentials? Where do they tend to come from? Are they other words that get shortened, or are they words that formally meant something to do with time or something else, or where does evidentiality come from in a language?"
32,109,Lauren,"One of the really great things about studying evidentiality in the Tibetan languages is that Tibetan has a pretty comparable literary history to English. It's also unsurprising, then, that it has a similarly monstrous relationship between letters and sounds as English does."
32,110,Gretchen,"The older the writing system, the less logical it is. It's just true."
32,111,Lauren,"So many silent letters. And so that's really handy because we can see in old, written Tibetan from 800, 900 years ago that there weren't these evidential forms. There were some older forms that have acquired evidential meaning. In other languages where we have the ability to trace it because of a literary history or because related languages have a similar form without evidentials meaning, one of the very common things that happens is a word that means something like 'see' or 'perceive' becomes -- and especially for the reporting of speech evidence, a word that meant 'say' or 'talk' -- becomes the grammatical form."
32,112,Gretchen,Right. Okay. That makes sense.
32,113,Lauren,"For example, the Yolmo form is 'ló' -- that is from an older form that meant 'to say.' And then a new verb that means 'to say' has come into the language."
32,114,Gretchen,"Kind of like how we might talk about hearsay evidence, which literally comes from the words 'hear' and 'say' and becomes an adjective instead."
32,115,Lauren,"Yeah. That's a really great example. A lot of the time it is taking from other words. And then sometimes, for example, the form that means that you know something from your own personal experience in Tibetan languages -- the personal, the ego evidential -- was a neutral, just general, good-old copula, but because these other forms came in, it created this paradigm that one got pushed there and that meaning was created for it."
32,116,Gretchen,"Because it was like 'Well, this used to be the normal way of saying something, but then if you don't say 'hear' or 'tell' or 'see,' then the neutral one becomes the really strong form''?"
32,117,Lauren,"It takes on that, yeah, very specific meaning."
32,118,Gretchen,"There's regions that tend to have evidentials in the Amazon, and Tibetan languages, Papua New Guinea, and the Balkans, are these because there's a bunch of related languages in these areas that have evidential markers or do they spread from one language to another even if they aren't necessarily related historically?"
32,119,Lauren,"There's a few things that happen. One thing is that evidentiality does seem to be one of those things that goes across language families pretty well. If your neighbours are speaking an unrelated language but you speak it because you live in a multilingual society, which as we know is the norm across the world, you might be like, 'Ah, that's a really handy thing. I'm gonna borrow that into our language.' There are some really nice examples of borrowing across languages. Sometimes, it's a form. We know that by Middle Tibetan a lot of these evidentials were starting to come into place and so a lot of the modern Tibetan languages spoken across Tibet, and India, and Nepal kind of have evidentiality because of this historic relationship."
32,120,Gretchen,And they borrow the specific words -- or they borrow the idea of it but use their words -- or some combination thereof?
32,121,Lauren,Yeah. Some of them it's an evolution from an older language that had evidentiality. For some of them it's contact that relates to it. But also we know that languages can develop evidentiality relatively quickly. It's something once you kind of start with that category -- so we've seen families where it evolves multiple times in different languages in the area. One reason that's given for this as a hypothetical is that evidentiality tends to arise in small communities where people care about keeping track of information and knowledge and ownership of knowledge.
32,122,Gretchen,"Right. I guess that makes sense, especially if you're asking someone, 'Have you seen this?' or 'Have you heard this?' you don't know what to expect from that person, which requires a lot of prior context. Whereas, if you interact with a lot of strangers, you don't necessarily have that context for everybody."
32,123,Lauren,"Yeah. And you're very concerned about not intruding on someone's knowledge or marking out very clearly how you know things, so you don't make assumptions about people's knowledge and what they know and what they don't know. Some people have hypothesised that's why it occurs a lot in smaller languages -- even though it's 25% of the world's languages that have evidentials, it tends to not be those bigger languages because by the time you get to being a larger language where lots of people who are strangers are interacting, they don't care as much about knowledge state and ownership of knowledge."
32,124,Gretchen,"So, if you're English or Mandarin or Arabic or something, you're like, 'Well, there's lots of people who speak these. They're spoken in big metropolises. You can't have every shopkeeper know what everyone's interior state is when they're coming in to buy bread,' or something?"
32,125,Lauren,"Yeah. I think it can kind of explain why it happens in smaller languages, but I also feel like it's shortchanging the potential of large languages. Tibetan is not a small language. It's spoken by millions of people. It has a long, written tradition. So, I think it's not the whole picture."
32,126,Gretchen,"And because they seem to spread from language to language, that also suggests that maybe they're easier to adopt. My favourite theory of evidentiality -- which I don't know if I actually believe this, but I'd like to believe it a lot -- is that we're developing a system of evidentiality using acronyms on the internet."
32,127,Lauren,"Oh, okay! Share your theory with me."
32,128,Gretchen,"I'm not committed to this theory, but I like the idea of it. And maybe someday it'll be true. I think the example that I'm gonna use -- because it's a theory that I talked about on Tumblr five years ago and I still think it has some potential. The Tumblr-appropriate example that I had was 'They'd make a terrible couple' because people talk about shipping a lot on Tumblr. I think you can say this with varying degrees of certainty or belief or emotion or knowledge or something. I don't know if they quite qualify as evidentials because none of them mean, 'I heard that...' or 'I saw that...' but you can say something like 'Tbh, they'd make a terrible couple' or 'Imo, they'd make a terrible couple' or 'Iirc, they'd make a terrible couple' or 'Omg, they'd make a terrible couple.' This at least adds something -- 'To be honest' or 'In my opinion' or 'If I recall correctly' or 'Oh my god.' This at least adds some sort of flavor to this. Again, this is very hypothetical theory and I'm not sure if it's a real..."
32,129,Lauren,"Well, they're definitely adding epistemics, so that's more about the certainty stuff we were talking about. But certainty could be a gateway to evidence if we continue to use them."
32,130,Gretchen,"Okay. So, we're like the toddler version of evidentials where we're putting certainty on?"
32,131,Lauren,Potentially. This is potentially a gateway to evidence.
32,132,Gretchen,I like this.
32,133,Lauren,We just need to create a bunch of acronyms that are like 'Isy' -- 'I saw yesterday.'
32,134,Gretchen,'Iht' -- 'I hear that.'
32,135,Lauren,Yeah. That's a good one.
32,136,Gretchen,I don't know if these are gonna catch on -- 'Ist' -- 'I see that.'
32,137,Lauren,'Itt' -- 'I think that.'
32,138,Gretchen,'Iit' -- 'I infer that'?
32,139,Lauren,"Oh, yeah."
32,140,Gretchen,"I mean, there's 'Til,' 'Today I learned,' but that doesn't commit to the source of the information."
32,141,Lauren,No.
32,142,Gretchen,Hmm. Okay. We've got some ways to go before internet acronyms become evidentials.
32,143,Lauren,"I feel like we have a potential grammatical spot ripe for potential evidential development. I personally think we have another rich source of evidentials on the internet, which is something we all take for granted as a basic piece of architecture on the internet, but a hyperlink is, really, a lot of the time used to provide evidence for something you say -- especially in journalistic use of hyperlinks."
32,144,Gretchen,Oh! I think I like this.
32,145,Lauren,"If you say something like, 'These two celebrities were seen out yesterday, but they'd make a terrible couple,' and it might link to something that's an article that says why they'd make a terrible couple. That's your evidence right there."
32,146,Gretchen,"Or you can do the extra-strong version of that, which is 'They'd make a terrible couple' but each of those words is linked separately to a different article."
32,147,Lauren,More evidence is stronger.
32,148,Gretchen,"That's like, I have four pieces of evidence -- five pieces of evidence -- one per word. Or 'This company has been involved in many scandals,' and each of those words is separately linked to a scandal. And you just see that, and you don't have to click on those, and you're like 'I know there have been a lot of scandals.'"
32,149,Lauren,"Or even if it's just linked once, you feel more comfortable. I never click on hyperlinks in news stories, but I feel more assured that the journalist has evidence for things."
32,150,Gretchen,"Yeah. I think I sometimes do this, especially if I'm making some sort of statement, maybe, that's not as much of an opinion. But if I'm saying something like 'Evidentials are a type of grammatical marker blah blah blah,' and I link the word 'evidentials' to the Wikipedia article on evidentials, I'm like 'Okay. I've done my due diligence. If someone wants to find out more information, they can.' You don't just have to believe me. You can go look it up on Wikipedia."
32,151,Lauren,Yeah. It's not the same because it does actually provide all that context. An evidential form just kind of lets people know what the status of the evidence is. But I think it's interesting how we relate to them as online content.
32,152,Gretchen,"That's very interesting. You could argue that the academic citation is maybe another kind of evidential in that case because if I wanna say, 'Evidentials are found in 25% of the world's languages. Gawne (2015) says this' -- I don't know if you say it."
32,153,Lauren,"Actually, you would cite 'Aikhenvald 2004' but... Yes, you're correct."
32,154,Gretchen,"Okay. So, '(Aikhenvald 2004) Evidentials are found in 25% of the world's languages,' and then even if I don't actually go read Aikhenvald 2004, I know that this has been asserted in conjunction with that person."
32,155,Lauren,Yeah. It's the 'I have read that' evidential.
32,156,Gretchen,"Yeah. Yeah. The other thing is, once you know about evidentials, I feel like you start noticing them everywhere."
32,157,Lauren,I definitely notice in English gossip. I'm always like 'But how do you know that?' I'm always looking for them. Or I always notice when people do explicitly mark them.
32,158,Gretchen,"Yeah. Once I started learning about them, I noticed myself saying 'apparently' a lot because I wasn't going to commit to the source of that. I noticed evidentials recently -- or the English non-grammaticalised type of evidentials -- in this book called The Raven Tower by Ann Leckie."
32,159,Lauren,Which is a great book. I read it on your recommendation and enjoyed it so much.
32,160,Gretchen,"Excellent! The conceit of this book -- this book is narrated by a tower, which is also a god. Anyway, it's fantasy. And the thing about the magic system in this world is that if the object gods in this world say something, it has to be true because if it's not true, then they will be automatically required to use their power to make it true."
32,161,Lauren,This is definitely a world where you don't wanna lie with an evidential.
32,162,Gretchen,"Yeah. And if that's not possible, then the god dies."
32,163,Lauren,Awks.
32,164,Gretchen,"Yeah. It's not a world where you have this strict 'You can't lie,' it's like 'You can lie, but you're in trouble if you do.' The human characters can lie, but the magical characters use speaking to create their magic. If you wanna make something true, you can just speak it true, which is kind of cool. But you also have to be very careful when you're telling stories or something to qualify how you know something."
32,165,Lauren,Because you don't wanna accidentally have not enough evidence and make something true.
32,166,Gretchen,"Exactly. You don't wanna accidentally say something that's too ambitious, you know? So, this character spends a lot of time -- the tower narrating the story, sometimes the tower will say, 'This is a story I have been told. Here's this blah blah blah story story.' With that frame, then they don't have to do that much hedging."
32,167,Lauren,You know what? This is world that would be ripe for evidentials.
32,168,Gretchen,"Exactly. It would be so much more economic because then they wouldn't have to do all of this hedging in longer form, they could just add it onto the verb and there you go. Sometimes, they ask things in terms of questions rather than saying, 'You found this strange?' -- because they address specific other characters -- 'You found this strange?' or 'You must've found this strange?'"
32,169,Lauren,That's making a lot of presumptions.
32,170,Gretchen,"Because they don't know whether the other character found it strange -- yeah. Instead, they can ask it as a question, 'Was it strange for you to hear this?' In the mind of reader, it's like, 'Okay. Well, it was probably strange.' But in terms of what the character's actually asserting it shows up as, 'Okay. You're not asserting it because now it's a question.'"
32,171,Lauren,I would love to see this book translated into Tibetan.
32,172,Gretchen,"Great! How do we make that happen? If you too would like to imagine what The Raven Tower might be like if the evidentials were more explicitly spelled out, I also did a live Tweet with some snippets from the book. You can follow along with that. We'll link to that. [Music]"

32,176,Gretchen,Stay lingthusiastic! [Music]
33,1,Gretchen,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics. I'm Gretchen McCulloch."
33,2,Lauren,"And I'm Lauren Gawne. Today, we're getting enthusiastic about why spelling is so hard and also hard to change. But first, Gretchen, it's almost time for your book to be out in the world, and I am very excited."
33,3,Gretchen,I am also very excited for people to finally get to read it. But you have already read my book about internet linguistics.
33,4,Lauren,"I have. This is why I get to be excited, because I know people are in for a treat."
33,5,Gretchen,"In fact, you are featured a little bit in my book about internet linguistics, which was very funny because as I was talking about everybody else in the book, I was referring to everybody by their last names, and when I got to you, I was like, 'I'm guess I'm calling her 'Gawne' for this book.'"
33,6,Lauren,"Oh, my gosh. Really?"
33,7,Gretchen,"Despite the fact that, of course, I normally call you 'Lauren.'"
33,8,Lauren,That is gonna be so amazing. I may have to listen to the audiobook just to laugh at that.
33,9,Gretchen,Just so you can laugh at how I don't have a cot/caught distinction and so I can't actually do the vowel that you do in your name.
33,10,Lauren,That's okay. I'm just really excited. The book is great. People can pre-order it now. And its out on the 23rd of July?
33,11,Gretchen,That's correct.
33,12,Lauren,You were explaining to me why pre-orders were so important. I'm learning a lot about books from you. It's an interesting world.
33,13,Gretchen,"Pre-orders are really important because, first of all, they help the publisher decide literally how many copies to print because they have a sense of how much people are interested in the book. Also, because when they're trying to count book sales for whether something ends up as a bestseller or is on some sort of list, all of the pre-order sales count towards that first week of sales. So, if you're likely to end up on a bestseller list, it's gonna be the first week, and the pre-orders all count towards that. It's huge. If you're excited for any book, really, you should pre-order it. And you should definitely pre-order mine!"
33,14,Lauren,Excellent. There'll be a link to that in the show notes.
33,15,Gretchen,It is called 'Because Internet' and is available where good books are sold. But there'll be a link to that.
33,16,Lauren,"This month's Patreon bonus episode is an interview with Alice Gaby, which is all about how we use directions in language and her work with an Australian language, Kuuk Thaayorre. It was from our November liveshow in Melbourne."
33,17,Gretchen,"Alice's research is so interesting. It was really fun to do in the liveshow because we got to have a whole room of people in an auditorium point where they thought north was and see how good people are at telling different directions, and whether linguistic or cultural factors affect how good you are at directions or what types of directions you pay attention to or you notice. I also got to quiz her on some Canadianisms."
33,18,Lauren,That was pretty great. We returned the favour by quizzing you on some Australianisms that Alice chose.
33,19,Gretchen,"Yes. That was very fun. You can listen to that and many other bonus episodes by going to patreon.com/lingthusiasm, which we'll also link to in the show notes. [Music]"
33,20,Gretchen,"Why is spelling so hard, Lauren? Why do we spend years and years learning how to spell and then we still mess it up?"
33,21,Lauren,"When you say 'we,' I think you mean me. I am definitely the more prone to misspelling out of the two of us. Let's just get that out of the way."
33,22,Gretchen,"I misspell things, but then I also notice them before the post goes up. Whereas, you put a post up and then I message you being like, 'Hey. I wanna reblog your post. Can you just fix this typo?'"
33,23,Lauren,"I would like to just say that I have a medieval manuscript approach to spelling, which is gonna be really important, and we'll explain why in this episode. But part of the reason that English spelling is hard is that it is a long and storied history. Every word is like this great little time-capsule nugget of linguistic information."
33,24,Gretchen,"I like to think of English spelling not so much as a phonetic approach to spelling -- we don't spell based on how something sounds -- we spell based on where a word comes from. So, if a word comes from Old English versus if a word comes from French, or from Latin, or from Greek, or from one of the many other languages that English has borrowed words from, English tends to keep each word's original spelling conventions or older spelling conventions, and then those come into conflict with each other. That's what makes it really difficult."
33,25,Lauren,But it makes it so great as well.
33,26,Gretchen,"Yeah! It also makes it really interesting. I think of spelling systems across languages as kind of like living in a house. When you first move into a house, you unpack everything and you hopefully say, 'Okay. I'm gonna be organised this time.' And you say, 'This is where everything's gonna go.' But the longer you've lived in a house, the more random boxes of stuff in the attic you have."
33,27,Lauren,English has lived in the house of the Latin alphabet for a very long time.
33,28,Gretchen,"Yeah. And so having a spelling reform is like saying, 'Okay. We're gonna pull everything out of the boxes. And we're gonna Marie Kondo this spelling system and make sure that all of the symbols are actually doing what we want them to do. And if they don't spark joy, we're gonna reform them.' But English has not really Marie Kondo-ed its spelling system in a very long time. That's one of its problems."
33,29,Lauren,"It's one of its benefits too. I'm gonna be pro-the-wacky-spelling, even though it is a major hindrance to me in my daily life. It's worth pointing out that the house of the Latin alphabet that English lives in wasn't necessarily a given. English has been written at various times with runes and other writing systems."
33,30,Gretchen,"That's true. The Latin alphabet was much better at spelling Latin than it was at spelling English, for example, because Latin actually only has five vowel sounds, and so it has five vowel symbols. That makes it a pretty easy correspondence. Whereas, English has five vowel symbols but does not have five vowel sounds. It has 14-ish depending on the dialect."
33,31,Lauren,"That's a really important thing with early English manuscripts where everyone borrowed this Latin alphabet in, but they borrowed it in to fit their dialect. There wasn't necessarily a standard of spelling. It means that there are four main dialects when you look at Old English manuscripts, where, if you read them, they give you a really good idea of what the sounds were in different regions of English. So, we normally think of the Mercian, Northumbrian, Kentish, and West Saxon, so there're kind of four large areas of English. You can see some of those sound distinctions still in modern English varieties. The difference is that we had them in the writing system as well as in speech, but the writing system became standardised."
33,32,Gretchen,"Yeah. The writing system became standardised, and even if you don't have a pronunciation distinction -- for example, the word 'gone' as in the past of 'go' and the word 'Gawne' as in Lauren's surname, I say them the same way but I still have to spell them differently because some people pronounce them differently."
33,33,Lauren,Yes. Some people would say something like 'Lauren /gɔn/ has /gɑn/ out to buy ice cream.'
33,34,Gretchen,"That's what you'd say, right?"
33,35,Lauren,"That is what I say, often."
33,36,Gretchen,It's an important part of your life.
33,37,Lauren,"Whereas, if we were making this podcast in the 1100s, we might choose to represent those distinctions, or lack of distinctions, in the writing system. But what happened was that English became standardised -- and people talk about this as being part of the success of internationalised English is that we agreed on a standard and it got 'fixed.' It got 'fixed' around 1490, which is a weirdly specific time. In the late 1400s, a guy name William Caxton brought the first printing press to England. And a printing press obviously deals with words in a very different way to manuscripts. If someone's handwriting stuff, they'll make different changes each time they write something out. Whereas a printing press is just making lots of copies of the same thing. Caxton had to decide what spelling he was gonna use in all of these copies."
33,38,Gretchen,"He was a lot more standard about it. He has this great anecdote, right, about trying to figure out what word to use or what spelling to use because of all the different varieties of English that were spoken in different regions there. And you can't please everybody. It's about 'eggs,' right?"
33,39,Lauren,"Ah, yes. Caxton's egg story, as people often refer to it. We know that there are dialects now, but at various points people felt like the dialects weren't even mutually intelligible. People couldn't understand each other in different parts of England. And there's a very famous story. Caxton was travelling in the north of England with a friend of his, and they were at a market, and his friend was like, 'Can I get some eggs, please?' And she was like, 'What is this 'eggs' you're talking about? I don't speak French. I don't know that word.' Another person came in and said, 'Ah, he actually wants some eyren,' which is a northern dialect word for 'eggs.' And she was like 'Ah, yes. Yes. Now that you've used that good English word for them, I know what you mean.' Caxton tells this story and it neatly encapsulates this idea that English was very disparate. It is still regionally distinct as well. But Caxton had to decide what words he was putting in books. Famously, in a way that has influenced English ever since, he chose the southern dialects from around the London area."
33,40,Gretchen,"Yeah. So, he decided to write down 'eggs,' which is why 'eggs' is standard in English now. But eyren is still very similar to the German word for eggs. It could've ended up that way for us as well."
33,41,Lauren,"Yeah. So, it's just because the printing presses were brought to London and not York that southern English is more strongly codified."
33,42,Gretchen,"One of my favourite examples of this is also that the printing presses started writing down English at the point at which we still pronounced the K before N that has become silent now in words like 'knee' and 'knight' and 'know' that have the silent K. They were once pronounced /kne:/ and /knixt/ -- and /knɔ/ or something like that? I don't know about the vowel there. That silent G-H in 'knight' was once pronounced /knixt/. And that double E was once pronounced as literally like a longer version of the vowel, which at the time was /kne:/."
33,43,Lauren,"That's because the printing press came in just before the big vowel shift happened and became standardised, which we talked about in our episode on vowels."
33,44,Gretchen,"Yeah. So, we're not gonna get into the details of the vowels, but there're all these sound changes that happened in English. At one point, these spellings were a lot more logical than they are now, which is part of this -- some of the discarded boxes up in the attic of the English language are like, 'Oh, yeah. Actually, we changed how to pronounce all the vowels. Sorry.'"
33,45,Lauren,"This box just has a label called 'Silent E Used to Sound Like Something,' and I don't even know what's in it."
33,46,Gretchen,"Yeah. Like 'Silent K Before N was Once Pronounced' -- oh, no. We put that away in a box. Sorry."
33,47,Lauren,Yeah. Don't need that. Up in the attic.
33,48,Gretchen,But some languages have actually done more rearranging and Marie Kondo-ising of their orthography houses than English has.
33,49,Lauren,Which takes a very top-down approach. You need the equivalent of a Marie Kondo for language in your language's life for that to happen.
33,50,Gretchen,"Yeah. Once you've started writing a language, and once people are getting literate and so on in the language, and you have books and stuff, it gets really hard to change a writing system because people, once they've learned it, they're like 'Yeah, well, it's fine. It's got some silent letters -- whatever.' The people that would benefit from the change are the people who haven't learned to read yet, and they tend to have less power."
33,51,Lauren,"There's that issue. There's also the issue of you can do a full spring clean of the spelling house, but no matter how good you are at doing that, you're gonna end up having more boxes. It just means that spelling freezes now. But the language is gonna keep moving on in terms of how it's pronounced and what words are used."
33,52,Gretchen,"Yeah. You need to clean out your spelling house every couple of centuries, at least. Maybe every century. Maybe every 50 years if you wanna be able to do it more gradually."
33,53,Lauren,Could you imagine having to relearn spelling twice every lifetime?
33,54,Gretchen,"This is why it's not always very popular. Then it creates problems with reading older books, too, because you go back and read a book that was published 200 years ago, and if you do that in English, that book is pretty easy to read. But if you do that in a language like German, which has a spelling reform every 10 or 50 years -- they'll release, like, 'Here's a few new spellings' -- it gets harder and harder to read your older literature. One of my favourite examples of spelling reform is from French because they did this really great thing, which was, 'Okay, let's have a spelling reform to get rid of some of the silent letters,' but instead of just completely getting rid of the silent letters, they replaced them with an equally silent accent mark to indicate that there had once been a silent letter here."
33,55,Lauren,That is so great. I like that because it speaks to my interest in keeping that history of the word in the spelling.
33,56,Gretchen,"Yeah. If you know the history of the word, you're like 'Ooo! There was a silent letter here. This is great.' And if you're a school child, you're like, 'So, I just write this? Fine?' This is what the primary function of the French accent circonflexe, which is the one that looks like a little hat -- I'm making the little hat sign with my hands as I say this because that was how we always talked about it in school is you have to make the hat sign with your hands."
33,57,Lauren,That's very cute.
33,58,Gretchen,"When you talk about that, you have to make a little pointy hat with your hands. There's a bunch of words in French that a lot of them get borrowed into English before their S had dropped. And then their S dropped in French, and then eventually the silent S got replaced with the little hat. If you have a word like 'forêt' in French, which is spelled F-O-R-E-little hat-T -- oooh! You don't speak French. I'm gonna make you guess what the English word was that was there."
33,59,Lauren,Do I just stick an S in there? Is that what you said?
33,60,Gretchen,You stick an S in after the E with the hat.
33,61,Lauren,"So, it becomes 'forest.'"
33,62,Gretchen,Yes! Forest!
33,63,Lauren,I know this one because of my ongoing interest in listening to The History of English podcast because you've put 'hôtel' there. And 'hotel' and 'hostel' are historically the same word. We borrowed into English the French 'hostel' back when it had an S. And then we re-borrowed it as 'hotel' when it didn't have an S. And we've borrowed it to have slightly different meanings about the type of accommodation.
33,64,Gretchen,"And 'hôpital,' which in English was borrowed as 'hospital,' was borrowed before the H became silent in French and also before the S became silent. So, it's now pronounced /œpital/, but it's spelled like /hapital/ but with the hat on the O."
33,65,Lauren,"When dictionary makers are doing etymologies -- which is the histories of words in a language -- this is the kind of clue they can use to tell when something was borrowed into English from French, even if there's no written record of it."
33,66,Gretchen,"Yeah. Because if you know when something became silent, you have this additional clue. There's a whole bunch of parallels between French and Spanish as well. A word like 'fête' which has the hat on the E there --"
33,67,Lauren,"Oh, it used to be 'fest'!"
33,68,Gretchen,Right!
33,69,Lauren,'Fête' and 'festival' are kinda from the same root.
33,70,Gretchen,And 'fiesta.'
33,71,Lauren,"Oh, my gosh."
33,72,Gretchen,They're all the same. They're a party.
33,73,Lauren,It's a party of parties.
33,74,Gretchen,"'Bête' with the accent, T, and then there's a silent E, but we're gonna ignore that..."
33,75,Lauren,'Best'?
33,76,Gretchen,'Best.' The additional clue that I'll give you is that there's a fairy tale called 'La belle et la bête.'
33,77,Lauren,Ah. 'Beast.'
33,78,Gretchen,'Beast.'
33,79,Lauren,Excellent.
33,80,Gretchen,"This was something that I figured out midway through high school French, and I was like, 'Oh, my god! All these words actually have parallels in English as well and I just never realised! And that's how I can remember whether to use this.' I remember telling my brother after a few years of French as well, and he was like, 'Wow! This is so great.' It's one of my favourite little --"
33,81,Lauren,Spelling actually helps you remember the words are related.
33,82,Gretchen,"Yeah. It's weird because the circonflexe doesn't really help French speakers that much, but it weirdly helps English speakers more than it helps French speakers."
33,83,Lauren,That's very un-French in terms of spelling reform.
33,84,Gretchen,"Yeah. It's like, 'Thanks Académie Française for helping out the English, which I'm sure you really wanted to do.' French has a reputation for being a language that's fairly difficult to spell because it's got a lot of silent letters. Spanish has a reputation for being a language that is fairly easy to spell because it doesn't have a lot of silent letters and it has had fairly regular spelling reform. Spanish doesn't use the P-H in a word like 'telefono.' They've put an F there because why do you need a P-H? That's just a sign it came from Greek. I said to a native Spanish speaker once, 'Yeah. I'm so jealous. Your language has such a great, logical spelling system.' And they were like 'Actually, you know what, I'm dyslexic. And there is this huge problem for me in the Spanish spelling system despite it being my native language,' because Spanish still writes its words as if there's a distinction between B and V."
33,85,Lauren,Right.
33,86,Gretchen,But it doesn't actually pronounce its words as if there's a distinction between B and V anymore.
33,87,Lauren,"So, you just have to know for the spelling."
33,88,Gretchen,"So, you just have to know. If you're an English speaker, this is actually pretty easy for you because you look at B and V and you think that they should be pronounced differently. And so you go into Spanish and you try to pronounce them differently, which gives you an English accent in Spanish, but does let you easily remember which one is which. Plus, a lot of them have cognates or related words in English that let you remember which one's B or V because you have an English word to pin it on. So, they had to rename the letter of the alphabet because they used to be called /βe/ and /βe/, which is the exact same sound. For a while, some people said, '/βe/ grande' and '/βe/ pequeña' -- the big B and the little B -- or '/βe/ corta,' the short B. Or sometimes they use keywords like '/βe/ de burro' -- 'burro' is 'donkey' -- and '/βe/ de vaca' -- 'vaca' is cow. So, one has a B -- burro -- and 'vaca' has a V, just to kind of remember. Eventually, the Spanish Academy changed the name of the letter V to /ɤβɛɪ/ instead of /βɛɪ/. So, now you have /βɛɪ/ and /ɤβɛɪ/, which helps you remember. But they're still completely useless for speakers. You could just pick one and spell all the words with it. And yet, they have not. On the plus side, the fact that they're pronounced the same way in Spanish means that the city of Baltimore is pronounced the same as the evil guy in Harry Potter, Voldemort, if you say them with a Spanish accent."
33,89,Lauren,"Oh, my gosh. But, you see, this is why spelling becomes really important so that people don't, in 500 years' time, be like, 'This is the city named after an evil character in Harry Potter.' It's the spelling that's gonna make it clear."
33,90,Gretchen,But wouldn't that be great?
33,91,Lauren,That would be a great miscommunicated etymology.
33,92,Gretchen,I support this folk etymology. Let's make it happen.
33,93,Lauren,"A reason that sometimes keeping the history and the historical spelling has really good benefits for a language, as in the case of Tibetan, where different dialects actually pronounce the same word very differently, but both rely on that historical spelling because they've forked off. English has changed a lot since English spelling was started. Imagine if there was a whole other dialect of English, which was almost mutually unintelligible for us, but also relied on those same spellings. A variety where maybe it was the N in 'knee' that got dropped. And so people say /ki/ in that language. But they know K-N = K. Whereas, we have K-N = N. If you read Tibetan -- and I don't actually. For someone who has spent years working with the Tibetan language, I work on the Nepal side and people choose to spell, often, with the Nepali alphabet, which is that Devanagari from India that has the line across the top. So, I can speak a Tibetan language, but I don't read Tibetan. Thank you to Ruth Gamble and Gerald Roche for helping me with this example. It's just full of silent letters. It's like English. You have a lot of letters that you write but you don't pronounce, but they're important for the spelling and the history of words. If you were to say something like 'It is good to speak Tibetan,' you would write that as, to do a very terrible literal pronunciation, something like /bɑd skiæd lɛɪ la yɔd/. But in the variety of Tibetan spoken in Lhasa, which is the capital of Tibet, the /bɑd/ would be /pə/. And that /skiæd/ would be /kɛ/, which you can see how all those letters have become silent or you've got a vowel shift as well like you've had in English."
33,94,Gretchen,Yeah. So many changes. And yet you can kind of trace them. The S drops. And the D drops.
33,95,Lauren,"Yep. So, you know that if you see that B written like that, you pronounce it more like we pronounce a P. And if you just spoke Lhasa Tibetan, you might be like, 'Why don't we reform this?' because it has the same kind of history as English. It started being written in the 7th century and codified by the 9th century, which is a very similar time-depth to English. But if you go to the Amdo region, which is a completely different area where they speak Tibetan, that /bɑd/ gets pronounced like /wɑd/."
33,96,Gretchen,"Oh, whoa. Okay. They did something different with the B and then the D stays."
33,97,Lauren,And the D stays. And they don't have the same vowel shift. That /skiæd/ becomes /kæl/. The D becomes more like an L.
33,98,Gretchen,"The S still drops, but instead of the D dropping, it becomes like an L?"
33,99,Lauren,Yes.
33,100,Gretchen,And you don't have a vowel shift?
33,101,Lauren,And you don't have the vowel shift.
33,102,Gretchen,This kind of historical alphabet lets them both read and write to each other or each other's literature and stuff even though --
33,103,Lauren,"Yeah. It means they can read the same newspapers and the same historical writings, but they pronounce it in their own way."
33,104,Gretchen,"That's really interesting. Another language with a similar time-depth, actually, around the 7th century to the 9th century, is Arabic."
33,105,Lauren,Looks like you need a good millennium to bake in some great language change and orthographic conservatism.
33,106,Gretchen,"That's how long it takes for your spelling house to get really messy. Classical Arabic is from around this period and that's the Arabic that's in the Koran, so it's very prestigious among Arabic speakers. It's got a lot of stuff that is not necessarily reflected in the pronunciation anymore. One of the things that I noticed when I was studying Arabic for a couple years in undergrad is that there are four kinds of Aleph in Arabic. Aleph's the first letter of the alphabet. It's got a common origin with the Greek Alpha and with our letter A. There are four of them in Arabic. There's your regular Aleph, which is just written like a straight line, and that just makes the /a/ sound. So, that's pretty easy."
33,107,Lauren,"You're starting at the start and you're like 'Well, this is easy and straightforward,' right?"
33,108,Gretchen,"Yeah. You're learning the Arabic alphabet and you're like, 'Great. Okay. So, there's all these letters and they make these sounds.' And I'm like, 'This sounds fine.' This was pretty straightforward. There's a one-to-one correspondence. And then they're like, 'Actually, here are some letters that there are exceptions for.' Aleph is one of them. Part of this is because, historically, Aleph wasn't actually an A sound. Aleph was a consonant sound, which is the glottal stop. That's the sound in between 'uh-oh' -- that catch in the middle of your throat. Historically, that's what Aleph was."
33,109,Lauren,"We talked about this really briefly in the nothings episode, but I didn't realise Aleph had a complicated history outside of that use."
33,110,Gretchen,"Yeah. Aleph was adapted to make the A sound or the /a/ sound by the Greeks because they didn't have a glottal stop. But it also got adapted to make versions of the /a/ sound by Arabic speakers, even though they did still have a glottal stop, because a glottal stop at the beginning of the word sounds a lot like just starting to talk. If you say the word 'Alpha' itself, you can say that with a glottal stop at the beginning -- /ʔalfə/ -- or you can say it without a glottal stop at the beginning -- /alfə/ -- and they really sound the same."
33,111,Lauren,Especially if you're like us and you don't have a glottal stop as part of your sound system.
33,112,Gretchen,"Exactly. That's why there's been some kind of complicated confusion. Arabic reintroduced a new letter, which is called Hamza, to actually stand for the glottal stop. But because glottal stop had this weird and complicated history where it used to be this other letter, Hamza's like a semi-letter in Arabic, which means that when it shows up, it always has to have, what they called in my class, as 'host.' It has to have another vowel that it goes on top of, but that vowel's actually sometimes silent."
33,113,Lauren,Right.
33,114,Gretchen,Because it's not a real enough sound for it to be there by itself. It's one of these interesting historical complications.
33,115,Lauren,It's a bit like spelling 'cough' O-U-G-H. That G-H is just kind of along for the ride.
33,116,Gretchen,Yeah. Or like the difference between 'through' and 'though' and 'thorough.' The vowel sounds get affect by the consonants even though it's actually the vowels that are changing. Spelling is weird.
33,117,Lauren,"It's always funny when I hear these examples in languages I don't speak, and it's just like, 'The Aleph is there when it's only got a host' and it's very trying to think about it in my head. And then I spell English relatively proficiently every day, which has equally crazy and complicated rules."
33,118,Gretchen,"Exactly. It's all what you're used to. But that's Hamza, which is like its own thing. There's still three more Alephs to get through. This kind of explains -- one of the Alephs is 'Aleph Maddah.' And that's a double Aleph. It expresses both a glottal stop and the long vowel together as two Alephs -- one of top of each other. Like one vertical and one horizontal."
33,119,Lauren,It's doing all the work.
33,120,Gretchen,"Yeah. But you don't actually use a Hamza in that case, which you should use with a glottal stop. Instead, you write a double Aleph, but that's because Aleph used to be a glottal stop and sometimes it still is."
33,121,Lauren,Right.
33,122,Gretchen,"And then you also have 'Aleph Maqsurah,' which is a totally different shape and not straight up and down like a normal Aleph is at all. It's kind of like an S-shape -- ish. But it looks a lot like the dot-less version of the letter Ya, which makes the /y/ or the /i/ sound, depending on context. That's the Aleph that only appears at the end of the word for fun, basically. The Aleph Maqsurah is often a feminine marker, so it's got grammatical functions. I don't know. Historically, maybe it was a Ya. I don't know why it's there -- why it's a different shape. But it's a different shape. And then the last Aleph, which is possibly my favourite Aleph because it's very rare and it's got a really good name, which is the 'dagger' Aleph."
33,123,Lauren,I like that you have a favourite Aleph.
33,124,Gretchen,"Look. If there are four different Alephs, I think one is duty-bound to pick a favourite of them."
33,125,Lauren,I wish we had letters that were called cool names like 'dagger.'
33,126,Gretchen,"Yeah. We have 'Double-U.' That's the most interesting name. A lot of the Romance languages call the letter Y, the Greek /i/ -- the Greek I -- like in French you say, 'ee-grek.'"
33,127,Lauren,Oh! That's why in Polish it's called 'ee-grek.' I've never thought about that.
33,128,Gretchen,Yeah! It's the 'ee-grek.' It's the Greek /i/ -- Greek I -- because it comes from upsilon.
33,129,Lauren,Gonna go around calling Y the 'Greek I' now.
33,130,Gretchen,Yeah. That's my favourite letter name in the Latin alphabet is the Greek I because it really encodes the origin of it in so many European languages.
33,131,Lauren,"I mean, it took me a very long time to think about Double-U being two Us. So, sometimes you're very complacent about what you're used to, I think, is really just the discussion of these characters."
33,132,Gretchen,"Yeah. Exactly. So, the 'dagger' Aleph looks like the regular Aleph, so it's a straight line up and down, but it's shorter. And it's written a little bit superscript. It's written a little bit up. And it's still pronounced the same way. It's only found in a few modern words, but those are some very common ones. For example, the word 'Allah,' meaning 'God,' has the 'dagger' Aleph in it. It's generally specially encoded so that it's produced automatically by font and coding programs."
33,133,Lauren,Right. Fairly visible.
33,134,Gretchen,"Because it's pretty important. There's just so much going on with what happens with Aleph that, again, you've got this kind of, 'Here's a history tradition. All of these made sense at some point. They still make some kind of sense if you look at the history of them. But they're no longer as active a distinction to modern speakers as they were when they were originally written down.'"
33,135,Lauren,"A lot of spelling is a bit complicated, and it has good reasons why it's complicated, and sometimes it's very helpful either for etymologists or for people learning to spell. But there are a lot of calls to reform spelling -- particularly of English."
33,136,Gretchen,"Because so many spellings are weird and have historical reason for them. I came across this great post on Tumblr, which we'll link to, which was a proposal to reform English spelling even more etymologically and say, 'Okay. If a word comes from a language that traditionally uses the Latin alphabet, yeah, sure, we can keep using the Latin alphabet for it. But if a word comes from Greek, we should keep using the Greek alphabet.'"
33,137,Lauren,"Right. So, we should be spelling 'tsunami' using Japanese characters."
33,138,Gretchen,"Exactly. You see where this is going, right? Or like 'vodka' using Cyrillic because it's from Russian -- and 'etymological' using Greek letters because it's from Greek. The whole post is written in this proposed spelling reform. It is very difficult to read -- and delightful."
33,139,Lauren,I like a good spelling reform. Lots of people have tried to reform spelling. You've made a proposal for a spelling reform for English.
33,140,Gretchen,"Yeah. I have more fun with spelling reform when it's kind of treated as a joke, because at this point, you're never gonna get all the English speakers to agree on some sort of actually good, or logical, or consistent spelling reform. I decided to say, 'What if we took advantage of this proliferation of competing standards and just made something that was completely out to lunch?' I did this as a talk for the Festival of Bad ad Hoc Hypotheses, which is a joke science competition -- talk."
33,141,Lauren,Which is great because it means I get to link to the video for people if they wanna see your full proposal.
33,142,Gretchen,"Yes. I have a full proposal. It's a video. It's been put online. It was at MIT a couple months ago and you can watch it. It's a lotta fun. What I said was, 'Given that there's some evidence that reading something in a harder font makes you retain it better because you had to put more effort into doing that -- or reading something in a language that's not your first languages makes you reason more logically because, again, you had to put more effort into that -- and so what if we made all English speakers expend more effort and made the spelling system completely ridiculous?' I propose let's just replace letters with weird Unicode equivalents and let's replace things with stuff from other languages and other orthographies so that we learn a whole bunch of other orthographies and so on and so forth and just keep going."
33,143,Lauren,"And that we all have to spell with other people's dialects, right? So, I would have to have a Gawne/Gone merger, and you would have to make that distinction every time."
33,144,Gretchen,"Yeah. Exactly. Because that helps foster cross-dialectal and cross-linguistic understanding if you have to confront the unfamiliar every time you go to write. I'm very fond of this proposal. I was very delighted. Once we put it online, some people commented on the YouTube video and on my Tweet about it in Tweets that had this revised, illogical spelling -- used it. It was very gratifying."
33,145,Lauren,Excellent. It's already starting.
33,146,Gretchen,"It's catching on, right?"
33,147,Lauren,I want a full return to dialect variation in English spelling.
33,148,Gretchen,Exactly. We need to go back to the days before the printing press and just spell everything completely as we want to. That sounds like fun to me. [Music]

33,152,Gretchen,Stay lingthusiastic! [Music]
34,1,Lauren,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics. I'm Lauren Gawne."
34,2,Gretchen,"And I'm Gretchen McCulloch. Today, we're getting enthusiastic about emoji and gesture. But first, my book about internet linguistics is coming out in less than a week from when this episode goes up."
34,3,Lauren,"Yay! It will be out July the 23rd, 2019. It's called Because Internet and it's available in all major booksellers -- including an audiobook which you read yourself, Gretchen."
34,4,Gretchen,"Yes, I did. So, if you like hearing me talk here, you can now listen to me read the book. Or you can read the book in the conventional way with the words in front of your eyes -- is also a thing you can do. I'm really excited to get to share this book with you -- to finally get to hear what people think about it. It is a really good thing to get it when it first comes out, because if it has any likelihood of hitting any sort of bestseller list, pre-orders and sales in the first week are what's gonna make that happen. If you can help us make more people pay attention to the book by getting it on any sort of lists, that would be super cool."
34,5,Lauren,This episode is a bit of a taster for the chapter on emoji that's in the book.
34,6,Gretchen,"Which you were kinda involved with, Lauren."
34,7,Lauren,"Which is why we've chosen this chapter. But there are lots of other topics covered in the book. I've been lucky enough to read -- you'll hear how that went in the episode -- I've read this book. I'm very excited for it. Other topics include things like how we use punctuation to signal tone of voice, the language of memes, and how the first social network you joined influences your internet life. That chapter I felt very seen."
34,8,Gretchen,I've had a lot of people contact me about that chapter. Because Internet -- there are links in the description. There are links on lingthusiasm.com. You can get it. You should get it. I'm really excited to get to talk about it more with people once they get to read it.
34,9,Lauren,"In other exciting Lingthusiasm news, we've added a new tier to our Patreon."
34,10,Gretchen,"Several people have asked us, very nicely of you, 'Is there a way we can support the podcast even more than the $5.00 a month for the bonus episodes?' Now, there is. If you sign up for the Ling-phabet tier -- fancifully named ling portmanteau names -- for $15.00 a month, we will assign you your very own symbol of the International Phonetic Alphabet based on our super scientific personality quiz. We had a lot of fun coming up with this quiz. Then we will add your name or name of choice and symbol to our Lingthusiasm Supporter Wall of Fame on the website where it will live as long as you wanna stay at that tier."
34,11,Lauren,We are also happy for you to nominate your favourite character of the IPA. We're happy to put any name within reason. This also makes a great gift for the lingthusiast in your life.
34,12,Gretchen,"Yes! We're really excited to provide a way for people who have a bit more money at their disposal to help support the rest of the episodes that remain free for anybody to access. So, think of this as a way of becoming a generous person to support the free episodes which remain free. We really wanna keep them accessible to everybody. Plus, in celebration of both the new tier and the new book, anybody who joins this new tier by August 15th, 2019, will get a book plate -- which is a little sticker that you can put in the front of your book for Because Internet -- which is signed by me with your name customised on it. We'll have a form you can fill out. You will get a sticker in the mail that you can put on your copy of Because Internet. The two things go together. Or I guess you could put it on your laptop or something if you wanted to."
34,13,Lauren,"You could just put it in another book and be like, 'Gretchen has signed this book for me.' Stickers are a very flexible thing. Having access to our bonus episodes means that you will be able to access our latest one, which is all about words that only your family use."
34,14,Gretchen,"We had a lot of fun talking about familects and hearing about all of your familects in the familect bonus episode. So, it's a lot of a fun. And, of course, if you join at the higher tier, you still get access to the bonus episodes. You don't lose your access to anything. It's just an extra thing that you can do if you wanna be super supportive."
34,15,Lauren,We'll also be recording an upcoming Patreon bonus episode that takes you behind the scenes on Because Internet.
34,16,Gretchen,You can read the book when it comes out and then ask us your questions about internet linguistics or what it's like to write a book. Tweet them to us @Lingthusiasm or email us at contact@lingthusiasm.com. Both of those are also on the website if you don't have a pen on you right now -- also by August 15th. Same deadline for both. We will answer them in an upcoming bonus episode. You get to hear all about what it was like to write a book about the fast-moving pace of the internet.
34,17,Lauren,So much book excitement. So much Patreon excitement. It's all happening. I'm so excited.
34,18,Gretchen,Everything is coming up internet.[Music]
34,19,Gretchen,The reason we wanted to do a very special Lingthusiasm gesture-slash-Because Internet emoji episode is because this is the part in Because Internet where Lauren actually makes a cameo.
34,20,Lauren,Yay!
34,21,Gretchen,"The story goes I was working on the emoji chapter, and I was kind of stuck, and I was complaining about this to Lauren, and Lauren very kindly said, 'Well, why don't you send it to me, and I'll read and see if I have any comments?'"
34,22,Lauren,I was really just wanting to read it because I was just really excited to see how the book's shaping up. It was entirely selfish.
34,23,Gretchen,"Well, it seemed very altruistic of you. I remember I had this list of gestures and emoji. I had like 'thumbs up' and 'nodding' and 'winking' and 'rolling eyes' and 'playing a tiny violin in false sympathy' and 'high five' and 'giving the middle finger' and 'shrugging' and all of these things."
34,24,Lauren,"I highlight this list and I'm like, 'These are all very nice examples, Gretchen, but we have a name for these in the gesture literature. We refer to these as 'emblematic gestures.' We can talk about what they are.' But I kinda just made this passing comment and sent it back to you."
34,25,Gretchen,"You sent a bunch of other comments, and they were nice, but this was the one that really stuck with me because you were something like, 'You know we have a name for this in the gesture literature, right?' And I was like, 'I didn't know there was a name for these.' I was just making a list of gestures that came to mind because when I was talking about emoji, I like gesture as an analogy to what emoji are doing because gestures and words work in concert with each other. You don't generally just do one or the other. You often do both. I thought this made a lot of sense in terms of how people integrate emoji with the words that they're typing. But I was just making a list of gestures that occurred to me. It turns out that what I was also doing without realising it was making a list of gestures that had common names in English because that's the kind of gesture that's easy to write down in words."
34,26,Lauren,"There's good reason that you did that, because these types of gestures tend to be useable with speech, but they can have a meaning on their own. They're very culturally specific. For example, not everyone uses the 'thumbs up' to mean 'good.'"
34,27,Gretchen,Right. Because in some cultures it means 'Sit on this.' It's like the middle finger. It's a sexual kind of insult.
34,28,Lauren,Yeah.
34,29,Gretchen,"Yeah. My list didn't include stuff like the gesture that you make if you're trying to give someone directions or if you're trying to say, 'Here's how I got from my home to this café. I went down this street, and then I went up that street, and then I went over here.' Those kinds of gestures that don't have conventional names are harder to describe on the page -- harder to describe in an audio podcast -- but those are another kind of gesture that I wasn't really thinking about at all."
34,30,Lauren,We talk about those gestures that kind of illustrate the speech that we make in our gesture episode. That's why we did the gesture episode as a video.
34,31,Gretchen,"Yeah. We did the gesture episode entirely because you were like, 'Oh, well, there's a name for this.' And I was like, 'Yeah. Oh, wait. Okay.' So, I'm sitting there, kind of googling/Wikipedia-ing like, 'What is this?' I think you were asleep in Melbourne at this point. I'm like, 'Lauren, send me all the things. I wanna know more about gesture!'"
34,32,Lauren,"If there's one thing I like more than talking to you about linguistics it's the chance to get to talk about gesture, which is one of my all-time favourite subjects. I think I sent you basically my entire undergrad language and gesture course reading materials."
34,33,Gretchen,"I definitely recall a syllabus -- yeah. You've taught courses about gesture, and I was like, 'Oh, my god. Send me all the things!' So, you sent me -- you know."
34,34,Lauren,I sent you all the things. So much enthusiasm.
34,35,Gretchen,"All the things. I started falling down this gesture rabbit hole, which was really cool to me because as a linguist I'm used to being able to have a conversation with someone and just kind of be sitting there being like, 'Yeah, well, what you're saying is fairly interesting, but what I'm actually doing right now is analysing your vowels,' which is a thing that we've all had happen to us, have we not? But also, in this case, I could be like, 'Oh, well, I'm analysing your vowels and I'm also analysing your gesture.' I'm at a café trying to keep working on the book, and I'm just looking around at everybody and analysing all of their gestures."
34,36,Lauren,"I always love this point when people start studying gesture, and they're like, 'I just can't stop paying attention to how people gesture.' And I'm like, 'Yeah. It's pretty great.'"
34,37,Gretchen,"Study linguistics -- we'll render you completely incapable of an ordinary conversation! But, yeah, it was really exciting. That was what kind of gave me -- like, 'Oh! We should actually do a gesture episode.' And then, Lauren, you were like, 'But we have a podcast. This is why I have not suggested that we do a gesture episode.' So, we ended up doing the video gesture episode because I got so into gesture, and it was like, 'We're gonna need to figure out how to do a video.' The thing that made me really excited about learning about gesture was that it actually explains a lot about how we use emoji because there's a distinction in the gesture between gestures that have conventional names and gestures that don't. We can see this kind of pop up in emoji as well."
34,38,Lauren,"I think this is because emoji are really -- humans want to gesture. I mean, we all gesture. People who have been blind since birth will gesture even though they've never seen other people do it. It's a really strong compulsion in human communication. I think emoji are allowing us to kind of return having a body to online communication. We always think of typing in chat as really disembodied. But having options like emoji allows us to start expressing those things that we want to express in conversation again."
34,39,Gretchen,"A lot of times, when we think about having a body online, we think about kind of a video game character-picker body, where you get the hair colour, and you get the clothes, and you have the haircut, and the eye colour, and these kinds of things, and what the figure looks like. But in actual fact, what people are doing with emoji is a lot more about what you're doing with your body rather than necessarily having a character picker, like an avatar, that kind of follows you around and does all the stuff. You do that in video games, but it's less common for conversations. So, it was that interesting, like, 'What role do gestures actually have in conversation?'"
34,40,Lauren,We have a few decades' worth of literature of people trying to unpack this and come up with descriptions of the different functions that gesture have. We've returned to the existing literature in this area that's been researching this problem for years and looking at emoji in the context of that.
34,41,Gretchen,"Yeah. It was really exciting to be like, 'Actually, we don't have to reinvent the wheel.' There's this distinction that seems to work pretty well that people may have been subconsciously porting into emoji. The thing that made me really excited about -- so the gestures that have names are called 'emblem gestures.' Emblem gestures are things like 'thumbs up,' 'middle finger,' 'peace sign,' and things like that. Emblem gestures have these really narrow constraints for how you have to produce them in order for it to be the right thing. My favourite Canadian-Australian cross-cultural example of this is like when I make the peace sign, I can make the peace sign with my palm facing out away from me or I can make it with the palm facing towards me, and it's the same peace sign. It's fine."
34,42,Lauren,"No, don't do that! Don't come to Australia or New Zealand or the UK and do that."
34,43,Gretchen,"Why not, Lauren?"
34,44,Lauren,Because that meaning is basically the same for us as the middle finger is. It's an offensive gesture.
34,45,Gretchen,"That's like 'up yours,' right?"
34,46,Lauren,Yeah.
34,47,Gretchen,"One of my favourite stories about this is apparently Winston Churchill, during WWII -- so during WWII, they had this 'V for victory' gesture, which basically looked like the peace sign. But Winston Churchill would often do it backwards. And there's historic records of people telling him, 'Winston, man, come on. You gotta stop flipping off the Nazis.' And he's like 'No, no, no. I'm gonna keep doing this.'"
34,48,Lauren,"Well, no. Winston said, 'Oh! Oh, golly. Goodness me. I am a posh man. I didn't know that it had that meaning --'"
34,49,Gretchen,And then he kept doing it though!
34,50,Lauren,"In public. Then, in private, he was like, 'Yeah, I totally knew it.'"
34,51,Gretchen,"So, gestures have really narrow standards of form. You have to produce a peace sign in the exact right way, or it might mean 'eff off'. But these ones that have names and standards of form, they also add an extra layer of meaning to what you're saying. If you say something like 'Good job!' with a thumbs up versus 'Good job!' with the middle finger or 'Good job!' with rolling eyes or a winking or something like this, those all have --"
34,52,Lauren,They all mean very different things.
34,53,Gretchen,Some of those are sarcastic. Some of those are an innuendo.
34,54,Lauren,"As you noticed in that list, there's a lot of -- because emblematic gestures are so good at conveying a lot of meaning in a single visual form, a lot of them have been made into emoji. But there are other emoji that also have a similar property that aren't gestures physically."
34,55,Gretchen,"Yeah. Exactly. Some of the emoji that became popular in the early stages of emoji -- things like the eggplant and the peach and the smiling pile of poo -- also seem to act in a sort of emblem sort of way. If you say, 'Good job!' and then the eggplant emoji or like, 'Good job!' and then the smiling pile of poo..."
34,56,Lauren,Or 'Good job!' and the flame -- just to give a nice positive spin.
34,57,Gretchen,Yeah. Or the flame to make it positive -- that adds this extra layer of meaning to 'Good job!' in the same way that adding a thumbs up emoji or a middle finger emoji adds this extra layer of meaning.
34,58,Lauren,"But I think, importantly, just in the same way that gestures have clear cultural differences between different languages or different communities, those emblem uses of emoji also have really specific communities of use."
34,59,Gretchen,"Yeah. Exactly. Not everyone knows that people use the eggplant as an innuendo. If you don't know that, then you might use it in its literal sense and be like, 'Oh, I'm making eggplant parmesan. Here's an eggplant.'"
34,60,Lauren,"No, Dad, don't!"
34,61,Gretchen,"If you search for, I think it's 'eggplant parmesan'/'eggplant emoji' on Twitter, you see a lot of younger people complaining about their parents."
34,62,Lauren,But also you can't use a corn or a cucumber to have the same phallic meaning.
34,63,Gretchen,"Yeah. Even though the shape is pretty much the same. But they're not substitutable in the same sort of way, just like you can't do -- the 'peace sign' backwards and the 'peace sign' forwards are not the same thing."
34,64,Lauren,"These emblematic ones -- basically, because you can name them, they're easier to spot. But there are other uses of emoji."
34,65,Gretchen,"Yeah. One of the things that I liked about this is that some of the emblems like the dancing lady in the red dress, which is just -- officially, it's just a dancer. For a while, a bunch of the different platforms had it encoded as different types of dancers. Google had this yellow blob with a rose in its mouth, and I think Microsoft had this disco guy, and Apple had this lady in a red dress. People got really confused when they thought they were sending a lady in the red dress and then their friend got the blob or the disco guy because they had these narrow ranges of meaning. Yet, yeah, these non-emblem-like gestures -- they have a lot more room for variation, right?"
34,66,Lauren,"Yep. For example, if I'm wishing you 'happy birthday' in a text message, I might send a few emoji to illustrate that. I might send a balloon and a birthday cake and the little party popper, because it's very celebratory. But I could just as easily send celebratory popper, birthday cake, champagne bottle -- because why not?"
34,67,Gretchen,"Or the wrapped gift or some of these other ones. The birthday cakes, for example, they're also really different across different platforms. They have different numbers of candles. Some of them are chocolate. Some of them are vanilla. Some of them are strawberry. They're quite different across different platforms. But this doesn't seem to bother people in the same sort of way. Sending someone a birthday cake emoji doesn't really have any additional meaning beyond just 'This is a birthday cake.' If you know what a birthday cake is, you can interpret a birthday cake emoji. It doesn't have the additional meaning the way the eggplant or the fire or the dancing girl in the red dress has."
34,68,Lauren,And you don't have to send them in any particular order. You don't even have to include those emoji. You could just send 'Happy Birthday!' like a boring monster.
34,69,Gretchen,"I really over analyse my birthday messages now because we've been doing so much analysis of what people use for birthday emoji. But, yeah, you can send a whole bunch of different things and they're all equally birthday-like, which is not true of words. If I say 'merry birthday,' I am clearly making a joke."
34,70,Lauren,Hmm. That is not the standard greeting.
34,71,Gretchen,"Or if I say, 'Birthday happy,' you're like, 'Excuse me, what? Sorry?'"
34,72,Lauren,You're not speaking English as she is known.
34,73,Gretchen,"Exactly. What I liked about this is that these unnamed gestures -- so the gestures you use to be like, 'Okay, here's the path that I took to get here,' or, 'Here's the motion that it takes to catch a frisbee or to throw a ball of this particular size and weight' and something like this -- those gestures also have a large degree of latitude for variation."
34,74,Lauren,"Yeah. We see a lot of variation in how people use gestures. Whether it is present or not is not necessarily -- it's not obligatory in the same way that syntax is, for example."
34,75,Gretchen,"Yeah. There's all this variation, and you don't have as many of the communication errors and problems when you're doing these kinds of gestures that just illustrate what's actually going on. If I send you 'happy birthday' and I put a birthday cake or I put the gift or I put a balloon, that doesn't change the meaning the way sending you 'happy birthday' with thumbs up versus 'happy birthday [middle finger]' ... that really changes the meaning there."
34,76,Lauren,Thanks. Great.
34,77,Gretchen,"'Happy birthday -- you annoying person.' 'Happy birthday -- I hate you.' Or like 'Happy birthday [rolled eyes]'? Like 'Whoa! Excuse me?' 'Happy freaking birthday, all right?' So, yeah, it was really exciting to get to kind of realise that this distinction between, okay, there are some emoji that seem to cast a different light on the meanings of the words that they're associated with. And there's also some gestures that cast a different light on the meanings of the words they're associated with. And there are some emoji that don't seem to change the meaning of the words involved and also gestures that don't seem to change the meaning of the words involved. They're just kind of the supplementary illustration. The fact that these distinctions seem to exist for both types was really fascinating to me. Then, I had to be like, 'Lauren, can I write you into my book because I figured this out thanks to you. I can't take credit for inventing this. Is it weird if I make you a character in my book?'"
34,78,Lauren,"I mean, it's kind of delightful. It's kind of an interesting extension of our podcast life. But the more I thought about this in relation to the data that you already had in the chapter, the more I was like, 'Actually, I think we need to do a really systematic analysis of the parallels between gesture and speech, and emoji and written language.' I was like, 'Well, how about we actually write an academic paper together that really drills down into the literature on gesture to see just how far we can take this?'"
34,79,Gretchen,"This actually solved a problem for me too because, I mean, I love a good taxonomy."
34,80,Lauren,Who doesn't?
34,81,Gretchen,"Who doesn't love a good taxonomy? Here's a way of carving up the world into different pieces that illuminate some of the differences between different situations. It's fascinating. But the other thing about a taxonomy is that it does give names to a whole bunch of different areas. This book is a pop linguistics book. It is a fun book. Like, fun is in the definition. It needs to be fun to read. The problem with saying, 'Okay, here's this academic taxonomy where we have six different names for different categories of gestures' -- I was restricting myself deliberately to one or two new words per chapter because that's about as much as a person can handle."
34,82,Lauren,"And I was like, 'No, all the terminology.'"
34,83,Gretchen,"'We need all the terminology!' And I was like, 'Well, this is great. I agree with this terminology. But I just can't use it all in a book that's aimed at the general public because most people do not have your decade-plus of experience in gesture studies, Lauren. I really hate to break it to you.'"
34,84,Lauren,One day.
34,85,Gretchen,"Writing an academic article meant that I could say, 'Okay, here's the kind of basic distinction, and if you wanna see more with all the terminology in place, go check out this academic article that we wrote together.'"
34,86,Lauren,One thing I really like about the article is it allowed us to revisit some data that you already had and come up with an analysis of how that fits into this emoji-as-gesture paradigm.
34,87,Gretchen,"It let me solve some of the questions and things that I had been wondering about from this earlier data. One of the things that was really interesting that came up -- so I did a study with a smartphone keyboard app looking at millions of anonymised examples of how real people use emoji in aggregate. One of the things that we came across really early on in this data -- so I got them to extract examples of the most common sequences of two, three, and four emoji, because this is a common thing that people do for a large data set of words is they'll say one of the most common sequences of two, three, and four words. So, let's try to do the same thing with emoji and see what happens because, obviously, we couldn't read individual people's messages. This is a way of kind of extracting from that and figuring out what the common sequences are. The most common sequence of emoji overall is [tears of joy] [tears of joy]."
34,88,Lauren,Right. Okay.
34,89,Gretchen,The second most common sequence is [tears of joy] [tears of joy] [tears of joy].
34,90,Lauren,Okay. Hmm...
34,91,Gretchen,Do you wanna guess what the third most common sequence is?
34,92,Lauren,"I'm going for, hmm, [tears of joy] [tears of joy] [tears of joy] [tears of joy]?"
34,93,Gretchen,Yeah. Four of them.
34,94,Lauren,Amazing.
34,95,Gretchen,"Once you get to number four, I think it was two kiss faces. So, it did change eventually. We did eventually run out of [tears of joy]."
34,96,Lauren,Just moved on to more repeating sequences.
34,97,Gretchen,"Turned out, we looked at the Top 200 sequences of two, and then Top 200 of three, and Top 200 of four, and about half of all of these lists was just straight up repetition of the exact same emoji. This was really interesting to us because a lot of the emoji narratives and media at that point were really excited about the idea of telling stories with emoji of like, 'Okay, if you have a [person] and then a [tongue sticking out] and then a [hamburger], maybe that means a person is eating a hamburger,' or something like that. But that's not what people were doing. People were doing the exact same emoji a whole bunch of times in a row."
34,98,Lauren,"I remember when you did that paper because I was like, 'Huh. That's some really nifty data.' When it came to thinking about this in relation to gesture, there's nothing that really fits that with words. If you look at the top combinations of words, it's like 'and the,' 'I am' -- there's no repetition. You might occasionally get a 'very very,' especially in formal conversation. But that's definitely further down than [tears of joy] [tears of joy]. If you look at gesture, you often get these repeating movements in gesture, often like an up/down -- if you ever watch the news without the sound on, you'll just see politicians doing these up and down repeating gestures."
34,99,Gretchen,"These very, like, podium gestures."
34,100,Lauren,They're known in the gesture literature as 'beat gestures' because that movement is so rhythmic and observable.
34,101,Gretchen,"Yeah. When I found out about beat gestures, I was like, 'Wait. Okay.' First of all, it's one of the most common gesture styles. You can observe anybody doing this. When I was in a café trying to write the book, I'd look over and be like, 'Oh, that person's doing beat gestures.' You don't often see people doing emblems in the wild. For all they're very exciting, they're fairly rare. Occasionally, someone will flip someone off or 'thumbs up' or something like that, but it's fairly rare. Whereas, you look over to any conversation, you're gonna see beats. I was like, 'Wait a second. Maybe people are writing [tears of joy] [tears of joy] [tears of joy] because that's what they would do in gesture.'"
34,102,Lauren,"It makes sense in terms of the function because a beat gesture is often analysed as being used to emphasise the particular words that they occur with. The more [tears of joy] I send you, the funnier I find something. Or the more heart eyes emojis I send you, the more I completely love something."
34,103,Gretchen,"Or the more plain heart emoji -- even though that's not a face -- the more you love and support something or you wanna indicate your enjoyment of something. All this repetition, even when they aren't specifically hands or faces -- even though they often are hands or faces -- seems to be serving a similar kind of emphatic function as the fact that we repeat our gestures so much. It was really exciting to be able to drill down into all of these different things that gesture can do and be like 'Oh, wait, yeah, emoji can do that too.' Even though the stories that I had been like, 'Oh, well, that's not real emoji use because that's just this stunt thing that people do,' it was like 'Wait a second. But people do that with gestures too.' People play games like charades where they act stuff out in gestures. It's just that it's not your typical type of gesture. But it's definitely one sub-type of gesture."
34,104,Lauren,It's definitely in a playful context.
34,105,Gretchen,"Yeah. It's a similar sort of playful context that people try to retell 'Les Misérables' or something in emoji. It's the same thing as trying to get people to guess, 'Oh, this is Les Mis' in gesture as well. It's often treated as a sort of guessing game where the fun thing is can you guess what the other person is trying to depict here. Yeah. So, I wrote you into this book. We started working on this academic article. By the magic of how publishing works, the academic article and the book are coming out pretty much the same time."
34,106,Lauren,I'm very excited for both.
34,107,Gretchen,"You're also writing up a piece in The Conversation, which is kind of a more accessible summary of the academic articles. There are lots of different ways to engage with this if this is something that you wanna dive into more."
34,108,Lauren,"I'm really excited that it's our first full, academic publication together."
34,109,Gretchen,"Me too! Because we've been collaborating on this podcast for so long and yet there's an academic collaboration too, which makes us just collaborators on more levels."
34,110,Lauren,This is further knitting into my day job.
34,111,Gretchen,"I think the most awkward part about this though was, when I wrote you into the book -- and I had your permission to do that -- and I was writing this all along and then I was like, 'Wait a second. I'm gonna have to refer to Lauren by her last name because that's how I refer to everybody else in the book.' I'll say their full name the first time, and then in subsequent references I just say their last name. I can't be like, 'Oh, well, this person, just because we're friends, I'm gonna call her by her first name. That's gonna be weird.' But it's also like I don't call you, 'Gawne.'"
34,112,Lauren,"Oh, my gosh. It's gonna be so weird reading that."
34,113,Gretchen,Yeah. You're in the index.
34,114,Lauren,"Oh, I'm super excited about being in the index."
34,115,Gretchen,"I'm really excited about everything in that index. There's two different kinds of sparkle punctuation in the index. Oh, my god. The index makes me wanna read this book, even though I wrote the book myself."
34,116,Lauren,"Of course, we've been talking a lot about emoji but even though obviously I think it's the most exciting and important chapter in the whole book for selfish reasons..."
34,117,Gretchen,You're a little bit biased here.
34,118,Lauren,"I'm a little bit biased and I don't want people to think that the whole book is just about emoji because there's obviously a myriad of other great language-y things that exist on the internet. This has really just been a taster of Chapter 5 of the book, which is the emoji chapter."
34,119,Gretchen,"Chapter 5. I have had people say, 'Gretchen, is your book gonna tell me what this particular emoji means?' It is not an emoji dictionary of 'Here are all the emoji and their cultural connotations,' because that's still something that's changing. That's still something that's in flux. Your best bet is still to go somewhere like Emojipedia or dictionary.com, which is providing specific definitions and cultural notes about particular emoji. If you want kind of a bigger story that's less like 'Here's a list' and more like 'Here's a bigger-picture view at how emoji actually fit into conversation, and why we're using them, and why they caught on so quickly, and are they still gonna be around in 50 years or 100 years,' that's what's in the book -- plus all this other stuff about internet linguistics like punctuation and memes."
34,120,Lauren,"The book is out 23rd of July 2019. For many of you listening to this now, it is out in the wild. You can read. I am excited for you to have this in your future.[Music]"

35,1,Gretchen,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics! I'm Gretchen McCulloch."
35,2,Lauren,"And I'm Lauren Gawne. Today, we're getting enthusiastic about syllables! But first, Gretchen's book is out now. If you haven't bought it yet, you should buy a copy!"
35,3,Gretchen,"Yes! It's very exciting to finally have other people being able to read the book and talk to me about memes, and emoji, and punctuation, and all of the internet linguistics things that I've been thinking about for three years. We are doing a very special Q&A episode for the book. This episode goes up on August 15th. You have until August 15, so you have some number of hours until it is no longer August 15th in any time zone. You can check ahead to Hawaii and maybe gain a few hours that way to send in your questions about things to do with internet linguistics, the book-writing process -- and then we'll do a very special behind-the-scenes bonus episode about that."
35,4,Lauren,"I'm looking forward to everyone else's questions. I have a bunch of questions about how the book-writing process went. I'm looking forward to that Patreon bonus episode. Also on the Patreon we have a new $15+ tier. Several people have been asking for a way to support us even more than the $5 a month for bonus episodes. At our $15 Ling-phabet tier you will receive your very own symbol of the International Phonetic Alphabet, which you can get through either a super scientific quiz or just merely saying that you have a favourite."
35,5,Gretchen,"Then, we will add your name and symbol of choice to our Lingthusiasm Supporter Wall of Fame on our website. We're happy to put your name or any other name within reason.

You can stick it inside your book and then you have a signed copy of Because Internet. If you join that very soon, you can get that as well."
35,6,Lauren,"Of course, even if you don't listen to this episode within the first 24 hours of it going up, you can still buy Gretchen's book from all good and bad booksellers -- preferably good ones. You can also support us on the Patreon."
35,7,Gretchen,"Yes. There are some other ways to get an actual, physical copy of the book signed, but this is probably the easiest one. Hopefully, you have a chance to do that. [Music]"
35,8,Lauren,"Gretchen, I am going to test you. Everyone can play along. I'm gonna give you some pairs of words and I want you to tell me whether they sound like English words."
35,9,Gretchen,Okay. Sounds good.
35,10,Lauren,They're made up -- some of them. The first one is 'blick' and 'bnick.'
35,11,Gretchen,"'Blick' sounds like a pretty reasonable English word. I don't know what it means yet, but it could mean something. 'Bnick' -- I'm not so sure."
35,12,Lauren,I actually even have trouble saying it. I feel like I'm saying 'buh-nick' -- 'buh' ... 'nick' all at once.
35,13,Gretchen,/bnɪk/ -- B-N-I-C-K. Not something I'd expect English to turn into a word -- no.
35,14,Lauren,No. The B and the N together don't really work that well. What about the word 'copter' versus the word 'pter'?
35,15,Gretchen,"Yeah, 'copter,' I mean, is an existing English word -- could continue to be an existing English word. Seems legit to me. 'Pter' -- yeah, the P-T thing, again, not really doing it for me."
35,16,Lauren,"Because that's the -- like when you say 'pterodactyl,' I know that it's P-T, but I can never say that P."
35,17,Gretchen,Or like the Greek 'Ptolemy' is just /taləmi/. It's not /ptaləmi/ even though that's how they said it back in the day.
35,18,Lauren,"In fact, 'helicopter' is from Greek 'heliko-pter' -- 'spinning' and 'flying' are the two roots there."
35,19,Gretchen,"It really seems like it should be from 'heli' and 'copter,' but it's 'heliko-pter.'"
35,20,Lauren,Which is not how my English brain can divide that word up.
35,21,Gretchen,No. No. It really isn't. But the Greeks are really happy to have /pt/.
35,22,Lauren,Okay. Next two are 'fneeze' and 'sneeze.'
35,23,Gretchen,'Sneeze' seems like it's doing fine. But with the F -- 'fneeze'?
35,24,Lauren,I'm really glad that you recognized 'sneeze' as a word. We're doing well. Good work.
35,25,Gretchen,"My vocabulary is really good. I know the words 'helicopter' and 'sneeze.' Yeah, 'fneeze' -- also not so much."
35,26,Lauren,'Fneeze' was the original way that English speakers said 'sneeze.'
35,27,Gretchen,That is amazing.
35,28,Lauren,"Then, when they started printing it, that 'F' looked like that long 'S' that you get in ye olde printing times."
35,29,Gretchen,And people started pronouncing it much more sensibly as 'sneeze.' We don't have any words in English that begin with /fn/.
35,30,Lauren,"Yeah. We literally had, like, three of them. And two of them are now gone, and people turned 'fneeze' into 'sneeze' because it felt more like the shape of an English word. Okay. Next one is 'sing' versus 'ngiss'."
35,31,Gretchen,"'Sing' -- again, an English word. I recognize it. Seems very English-word-like. But 'ngiss' -- I don't think we have any English words that begin with /ŋ/."
35,32,Lauren,"No. But we do in languages like -- a lot of Australian languages and also Syuba, the language I work on, has that initial /ŋ/ sound. Even though I know this, I really struggle to pronounce it because it's not where it goes in English. We have it at the end of a word. I know I can make this sound. But I really struggle to make it at the start of a word."
35,33,Gretchen,"You have it in Vietnamese at the beginning of words. And Cantonese, I think, sometimes you see it in people's last names -- but not at the beginning of words in English."
35,34,Lauren,The final pair is 'heat' and 'tih.'
35,35,Gretchen,"'Heat' -- also an English word. Seems like it works. 'Tih' -- with the 'H' at the end, I can make it, but it kind of reminds me of when I was studying Arabic and I had to learn how to make words that ended with an 'H' sound because that's not where we're used to saying it in English. Even if you write an H -- like 'Ahh!' -- you write it with an H, but you don't say /ahh/ unless you speak Arabic, maybe."
35,36,Lauren,"H goes at the start of a word for English, /ŋ/ goes at the end of a word, and when you try and put them in the other spot, it's really hard to say and it's really hard to hear as well."
35,37,Gretchen,"That's something that I find really interesting because when we think of the sounds of a language, it's easy to be like, 'Okay, here's a list of the sounds in this language,' but it's not just about which sounds you have, it's also about how you can combine them with each other -- which ones can go at the beginning of the word, which ones can go at the end of the word. Not all languages let you do all possible combinations."
35,38,Lauren,"That's because different languages have different structures for their syllables and what sounds can go together in a syllable, which is like a chunk of sounds together."
35,39,Gretchen,"A word is made up of syllables and that kind of determines what one you can do. If you talk about words that are just one syllable long, that kinda gives you the maximal picture of what sounds can combine in that language."
35,40,Lauren,"What sounds can combine and what spots they can go in within that structure. In fact, the word 'syllable' comes from a Greek word that means 'goes together' or 'what goes together,' which is a really nice -- I kind of like that, that 'syllable' means what can hang out together."
35,41,Gretchen,"That's very nice. Also, just to clarify, we're not talking about signed languages here because signed languages don't have sound-based rules for how they go together because they don't have sounds."
35,42,Lauren,They're not stuck with this narrow-minded problem of linear time in the way that sounds are when they all have to follow a string.
35,43,Gretchen,"Sounds only exist in one dimension. Signs exist in two dimensions. They've got their own constraints, and we're just not gonna get into them in this episode. Yeah! Different languages have different shapes for their syllables -- different ways they like their syllables to be constructed. I like to think of a syllable as kind of like a burger."
35,44,Lauren,Awesome.
35,45,Gretchen,"It's a very delicious metaphor. I'm sorry if anyone's hungry right now. You have your pieces that go together like the patty and the bun, and the various toppings, and cheese and so on that you might add to your burger. There's various different kinds of ways you can do that when you're looking at the syllable-burger as a whole."
35,46,Lauren,Different languages allow you to put different things in the burger and in different orders.
35,47,Gretchen,"Yeah, and some people -- there was a lot of controversy about the burger emoji a while back because people were annoyed that some versions of it had the cheese below the meat instead of on top of the meat. The order is important when you put things in a burger."
35,48,Lauren,And what you include and how much you can include in a burger definitely varies from place to place.
35,49,Gretchen,It can be political sometimes. I don't know what you guys put in burgers in Australia that is different.
35,50,Lauren,"Well, a classic Australian burger has beetroot in it."
35,51,Gretchen,"Oh, okay. See, I would definitely not think of beets as a thing you put in burgers."
35,52,Lauren,It's delicious.
35,53,Gretchen,"It probably is. I've never tried it. Languages are also often faced with syllables that they can't necessarily handle through their own internal resources. They have a couple options. One of those is to say, 'Okay, there's so much here that I'm actually gonna split this across two burgers' and another of which is to say, 'Look, there's so much here. I'm just gonna take some stuff out and completely discard it.' One very salient example to English speakers sometimes is when Spanish borrows a word from English. In English, you can start a syllable with a sequence of sounds like /sp/ or /sk/ or /stɹ/. You can have an S and then a consonant or some consonants after it at the beginning of a syllable in a sequence like 'Sprite' or 'school' or 'scheme' or 'street' or in a name like 'Stephanie.' But in Spanish, this combination of S and a consonant at the beginning doesn't work. You can have just S at the beginning, but you can't have S and then a consonant at the beginning of a syllable. It's just not something they're keen on. The way that that they deal with this is they say, 'Okay, if you try to put S and then a consonant at the beginning of a syllable, you're gonna add a vowel in before the S.' Now, the S belongs to the previous syllable and the consonant belongs to the next one. You've split them across too different sorts of burgers. You get things like 'Stephanie' becomes 'Estephanie.' Or 'Sprite' becomes 'Esprite.' Or 'school,' which goes back to the Latin root 'schola' becomes in Spanish 'escuela' rather than 'scuela' or 'schola.' In all of these cases, you're adding the E at the beginning to kind of rescue this S and allow it to stay because otherwise it's not something that works for speakers of that language to pronounce."
35,54,Lauren,"Nepali speakers do the same. But instead of E at the start for their burger, they use an /i/ burger. So, it's '/iskul/' instead of '/ɛskul/.' They don't like S and K in the same burger, so they move the S over to another little burger with an /i/."
35,55,Gretchen,"I like to think of the vowel in the middle as the meat or the patty or the portabello mushroom in the middle of the burger. Then, you have your consonants on the other side, which are kind of like the buns. It's like 'No, we've got too much bun. This bun is too big. We need to give it its own patty -- its own vowel -- by adding an extra vowel.' Another example of this is -- so Hawaiian, which is really -- the largest syllable that it will let you have is just a consonant and a vowel all by itself. When the expression 'Merry Christmas' was borrowed in Hawaiian, it got converted into 'Mele Kalikimaka.' 'Merry' becomes 'mele' because they don't have an R in Hawaiian. That's pretty straightforward. And then 'Christmas' -- so that has a /k/ /ɹ/, /kɹ/, but that's too much in Hawaiian, so you get 'kali' rather than /kɹ/ to break up that sequence as well."
35,56,Lauren,"Hawaiian is like when you choose to eat lots of individual, tasty, smaller cheeseburgers rather than one big burger full of stuff."
35,57,Gretchen,"Yeah. It's kind of like the sliders of syllables. Everything's just a bunch of small, open-faced sandwiches."
35,58,Lauren,I think the important thing here is everyone still gets to eat plenty of burgers.
35,59,Gretchen,"It's interesting because there've been some studies that show that some languages have syllables that are smaller -- that just have maybe, maximum, a consonant and a vowel, or a consonant and a vowel and a consonant and no more. Those languages tend to pronounce their syllables faster because there's less information in them. Whereas, a language like English, the most dense-syllabled word in English is the word 'strengths,' which has got three at the beginning S-T-R, and at the end it's got /ŋ/ /θ/ /s/. 'Strengths' -- three at the beginning, three at the end."
35,60,Lauren,That is a very large and full hamburger situation.
35,61,Gretchen,"It's a very large and dense -- there's a lot of toppings and stuff on this hamburger. So you say those a bit slower because they've got more information in them. When you count by syllables, it seems like some languages are faster, but it's because they've got smaller syllables. If you count by bit of information, they actually end up averaging out to about the same."
35,62,Lauren,"I learnt Polish, which also is a language that allows a lot of stuff in a single syllable burger. But it allows different stuff to English. It took a long time to get my head around that. I know we don't normally try and apologise for how badly we speak languages on the show but, like, I really do feel it's been a long time since I've worked out my Polish consonant cluster mouth. A word like 'wstrząs' which means 'shock,' has multiple consonants before that vowel that we don't normally put together in English."
35,63,Gretchen,Yeah. I don't even think I can produce it -- /vəʃɑnt͡s/ -- yeah. I'm definitely dropping some of them just to --
35,64,Lauren,Just to try and make it fit within the kind of burgers that you're used to.
35,65,Gretchen,One thing I could do if I was trying to say that is /vʃɑnt͡s/ -- I'm gonna drop one. Or I could say /və-ʃɑnt͡s/ and try to add a vowel in between to split it up.
35,66,Lauren,A bit like Hawaiian speakers do with 'Kalikimaka' for 'Christmas.'
35,67,Gretchen,"Exactly -- add a vowel there. English speakers, sometimes we drop stuff. Sometimes, we don't. You can see this in words that we've borrowed from other languages. Like with 'helicopter,' you don't need to do that there because it's in the middle of the word. But in a word like 'pterodactyl,' you just drop the P. Or 'psychology,' you just drop the P there. Or 'xylophone,' which was originally /ksɑɪləfoʊn/ because that's what sound an X makes."
35,68,Lauren,"Oh, yeah. I never thought about that. Most of you just get used to saying words how you say them."
35,69,Gretchen,"Yeah, exactly. In French, for example, they've also borrowed these words from Greek, but French is more okay about saying those consonants at the beginning. In French, you say, 'la psychologie' and 'xyloph' -- I don't know if you do it with 'xylophone' -- /ksiləføn/. You definitely say /psikələʒi/ in French. You don't say /sikələʒi/. Sometimes, in English we drop it. And sometimes, in English we add another little vowel to kind of rescue all of the consonants. In words from Russian, some English speakers can say things like 'Vlad' and 'Ksenia,' but a lot of times you'll get /vəlæd/ or /kəsɛnjə/ in order to try to keep both of the consonants there."
35,70,Lauren,A bit like Spanish speakers and Nepali speakers with /iskul/. We move that initial /v/ in 'Vlad' to its own /vəlæd/ syllable.
35,71,Gretchen,"To try to say the whole thing. Japanese does this as well. In an English loan word like 'picnic,' because in Japanese they don't like consonants at the end of a syllable unless it's an N or an M, so 'picnic' becomes something like 'pikuniku' because you wanna rescue those Ks by giving them their own vowel."
35,72,Lauren,"The start and the end of a syllable have their own characteristics. We've been talking around the kind of burger part and what can go before or after the burger. But that can differ. With Japanese, you can only have an M or an N after that central part."
35,73,Gretchen,"Exactly. I think this is one of the reasons I like a burger metaphor in particular because a sandwich also has a central part with the filling and two pieces of bread, but what makes a burger distinct is that it's asymmetrical. You've got a top of a bun that's different in shape from the bottom of the bun. Languages often let you do different things with the start of the syllable than they let you do with the end of the syllable. In many cases, at the end of the syllable, you can't put as many consonants there. Sometimes, you can only put a few, like M and N, or you can't put any, like in Hawaiian. Or in English, you can put the /ŋ/ at the end of a syllable, but not at the beginning. Or you can put the H -- the /h/ -- at the beginning of the syllable but not the end."
35,74,Lauren,Yeah. We definitely can't put it at the end as we discovered at the start of this episode.
35,75,Gretchen,"/ŋah/, / ŋah/, what a great word! 'Hang' -- totally good word. /ŋah/ -- not a word."
35,76,Lauren,"/ŋah/ for English is the equivalent of serving a burger with the bun upside down. An English speaker would just be like, 'What is happening?'"
35,77,Gretchen,'What have you done?'
35,78,Lauren,'What have you done with my burger?'
35,79,Gretchen,"It doesn't even sit on the plate. The top is curved, so it doesn't even sit there. It just kinda falls over."
35,80,Lauren,It could be a perfectly good burger in many other languages -- a very confusing burger in English.
35,81,Gretchen,"Right. What you think of as something that belongs on the top, or what you think of as something belongs on the bottom. I think there's also so room for some individual variation. Do you put the ketchup on the top bun or the bottom bun? I don't know. In general, languages do have this asymmetric relationship between what can go before and after the vowel."
35,82,Lauren,The vowel being that really central -- it's hard to -- a burger without the patty in the middle is a salad roll.
35,83,Gretchen,"Yeah, if you have -- I was trying to think about this as well, because you need to stress test your metaphors before you commit to them. I was thinking, back in the day, when I was a student and not very organised, and I was a vegetarian and I was trying to get enough protein, sometimes I would just eat a veggie burger with some carrot sticks or something, or a salad or whatever, because I wouldn't have the buns. That's something you can do when you've still eaten, by some definition, something of a burger. I think if I just had the bun by itself, I have not eaten a burger."
35,84,Lauren,"No, you've eaten a roll."
35,85,Gretchen,"You've just eaten a roll. You've eaten a bun. By no definition is this a burger. Whereas, if you just eat the patty, you have kind of still eaten a burger even though it's a very small burger."
35,86,Lauren,"Overwhelmingly, when people talk about syllables, the vowel that's in the middle is a really central anchor point for almost all languages."
35,87,Gretchen,"You need this anchor point of something to make the syllable. It's generally a vowel, but it's not 100% a vowel because there are some words in English, for example, depending on how you pronounce a word, like 'bottle,' you probably say /bat-l̩/ and it's just really just an L -- /l/. You could say /battəl/, which might give you vowel there. You could just say /baʔl̩/ or /baʔn̩/ and that might just be /n/ -- the N itself -- that's the second syllable and there's no vowel to speak of."
35,88,Lauren,That N is the portabello mushroom of burgers.
35,89,Gretchen,"Yeah, exactly. It's kind of the centre of it, but you don't normally think of it as a prototypical burger."
35,90,Lauren,"As a vegetarian, I am really sick of portabello mushrooms as burger. But as a language speaker, I love syllable nasals and syllable Ls."
35,91,Gretchen,"Well, I also kind of think of -- so you have can have in the middle one vowel, but you could also have several vowels. You could have something like 'bike' has /ɑɪ/, which is a diphthong, which is kind of two vowels smooshed together. So, maybe that's kind of like a deconstructed burger -- something that's got multiple pieces inside of it."
35,92,Lauren,You can order two patties in a burger if you want a really meaty burger -- yeah.
35,93,Gretchen,"The other reason I really like this burger metaphor is that if that you wanna serve a burger with only one bun, you probably take the top one off because that's the one that's the weirder shape, and you can still leave the bottom part of the bun and the patty part on your plate. There's also kind of a different relationship that this vowel has with the consonant or consonants that come after it versus the ones that come before."
35,94,Lauren,It's a very fancy restaurant that you're eating in if you have to use cutlery to eat a topless burger.
35,95,Gretchen,"You can have an open-faced sandwich. People don't often have an open-foot sandwich. What's the opposite of an open-faced sandwich, where you only have the top?"
35,96,Lauren,"An 'open-bottom sandwich,' which is, I think, why they don't say it. It sounds ridiculous and it looks ridiculous, and it's even more ridiculous to eat."
35,97,Gretchen,It's very messy.
35,98,Lauren,"Although, it totally works fine for syllables. So, we found, finally, the first thing where the metaphor really doesn't hold."
35,99,Gretchen,"Yeah, the metaphor doesn't hold in the sense that you can have a syllable like /ba/, which doesn't have a bottom thing. But there is this closer relationship that the vowel has with anything that might come after it, because when we talk about what are different kinds of poetic devices you can do with languages or what are interesting kinds of ways you can play around with sounds -- so you can have things that rhyme, which means that the vowel and any consonants that come after are the same. Or you can have alliteration, which means that just the initial consonants are the same. You don't often get something where the first consonants and the vowel are the same, but the latter consonants are different."
35,100,Lauren,"As a poetic device. Obviously, we can do this, but we're not as into it."
35,101,Gretchen,"You have 'bad,' 'mad,' 'sad,' 'glad' -- these all rhyme. It's great."
35,102,Lauren,Excellent.
35,103,Gretchen,"Or you can have 'bad,' 'big,' 'Ben,' 'brigand,' 'boxes' -- and all these begin with B. You could make some sort of 'Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers' sort of thing out of them. But 'bad,' 'bat,' 'bag,' 'back,' 'ban' --"
35,104,Lauren,They're technically more alliterative because they all have B and A. But we don't necessarily find them any more compelling than anything that was just a B at the start.
35,105,Gretchen,"Yeah. The extra vowel doesn't seem to gain us anything, as opposed to 'bad,' 'mad,' 'sad,' 'glad,' which is like, 'Yeah! This is great! This is really doing something. Now we're in a Dr. Seuss story.'"
35,106,Lauren,So satisfying. We're really into rhyming as a poetic device in contemporary English. But Old English was really into alliteration.
35,107,Gretchen,"In Old English, it's all about those initial consonant sounds, and they didn't really care about the ends. This is a distinction that seems to be relevant in a lot of languages -- the rhyming part of the syllable as compared to the onset part, which is just that initial set of consonant or consonants at the beginning."
35,108,Lauren,"You need to understand how this rhyme part works, not overtly because obviously people can make rhymes without sitting there going, 'Hmm, I must make sure that the vowel and the information following it is all the same in order to create a successful rhyme,' but you see even really young kids are great at understanding if something rhymes and also are really good at Pig Latin, which requires you to take the onset -- so that top of the burger -- off and then put it on the top of another, new syllable burger, which ends in A. I am terrible at Pig Latin."
35,109,Gretchen,"Oh, I did it a lot as a kid. You have, like, 'Pig Latin' becomes 'Ig-pay Atin-lay.' That 'ig' that's left over is your rhyme. And then you've taken the onset -- the P -- and put it at the end. So, example, my name 'Gretchen' and you put it into Pig Latin, it's 'Etchen-gray' because you've taken both the G and the R -- because that's the whole onset -- and put it at the end."
35,110,Lauren,"Having 'Retchen-gay' would be very bad Pig -- like, I would not be Pig Latin-ing correctly."
35,111,Gretchen,"Yeah. That's not how you Pig Latin. People are sensitive to this distinction even though most people don't know the word 'onset' or think about it in those terms. It's something that is very intuitive from a language game. There's also Latin games like 'Ibbish' or ""Obbish' where you put 'ib' or 'ob' in between the onset and the rhyme. In a word like -- oh, I can't do this one at all. In a word like 'pig,' you would 'pib-ig' or something like that -- or 'pob-ig.'"
35,112,Lauren,This makes me so much happier to know that the kind of on-the-fly processing that you need to do for things like Pig Latin really are learnt behaviours because you can't just immediately do it with another one.
35,113,Gretchen,"I can do Pig Latin really fast, and the other ones I didn't learn as a kid. You've gotta make sure that your kids acquire Pig Latin when they're young enough because otherwise they'll never get them."
35,114,Lauren,"I missed the Pig Latin acquisition window, clearly."
35,115,Gretchen,"I know. It's terrible. I missed the Ibbish/Obbish acquisition window. This is something that people are really sensitive to. And yet, there's not alternative version of Pig Latin where it's like -- I don't even know how you would do it. You'd have to be like..."
35,116,Lauren,P-A-/gə/.
35,117,Gretchen,"Well, I'm trying to think -- so what if you take the last consonant and you put it at the beginning -- 'gepi'? 'Latin' would become 'Naylati.' This is just not a thing that language games do."
35,118,Lauren,"I never had much luck learning Pig Latin, but understanding how syllables work has made me much more aware of going learning other languages when it comes to -- because we focus a lot on learning the sounds of a language, but it's rare to be explicitly taught how to combine those sounds into syllables."
35,119,Gretchen,"I think that was something that I noticed when I was learning Arabic that I had to learn how to make this H at the end of the word -- when I was learning German -- because they have not just /ʃtɹ/ but you can also do something like /ʃm/, which is less common in English except in a few loan words. Another interesting example of this is in Dutch where they have this combination of /s/, which is very straightforward, and /x/, like the German C-H sound -- /x/ -- but together it's like /ʃx/ and I just can't do it. I have tried a lot. There's a city -- and this is a very unique sound combination to Dutch -- and there's this city, which I'm gonna pronounce wrong, but it's like 'Scheveningen' -- maybe. This was used as a shibboleth during the second World War to distinguish between whether somebody was Dutch or not. They would try to get them to pronounce this name because it's really hard if you're not Dutch."
35,120,Lauren,It's a bit like when I was learning Syuba and other Tibetan languages that have that initial /ŋ/ sound. It was very frustrating to know I can make this sound. I've made it in English my whole language-speaking life. But putting it at the start of the word suddenly becomes a challenge for the shape of the mouth.
35,121,Gretchen,It's the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. The combination of sounds is an additional thing that can be really interesting about language even apart from the individual sounds that are there.
35,122,Lauren,"Just like it's fun to bring people to Australia and introduce them to burgers with beetroot in it, it's really fun when you learn a new language to figure out what combinations of sounds it allows."
35,123,Gretchen,"Yeah. Linguists have a lot of fun drawing diagrams to represent the information about -- okay, what can go in the onset of this syllable? What can go in the rhyme? How can we divide the rhyme further between the nucleus, which is the vowel, and the coda, which is the consonants that come after? How can we represent this information in a way that makes it easier to talk about the differences and similarities between languages?"
35,124,Lauren,"Of course, diagrams are fun. But hamburgers are more fun."
35,125,Gretchen,Maybe linguists should draw their syllable diagrams as if they were actually hamburgers -- new proposal. [Music]

36,1,Gretchen,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics! I'm Gretchen McCulloch. I'm here with Dr Lynn Hou, who's an assistant professor of linguistics at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and a signer of American Sign Language. But first, it's thanks to our patrons that we're able to expand the podcast into interesting new formats like this video episode about signed languages, which is one of our most-requested topics. To become a patron, you can go to patreon.com/lingthusiasm.[Music]"
36,2,Gretchen,"Hello! Lina, welcome!"
36,3,Lina,Hello. Happy to be here.
36,4,Gretchen,"It's so nice to have you on the show. This is a question that we start with all of our guests, how did you get into linguistics?"
36,5,Lina,"Oh, that's a fascinating story, if I do say so myself. Well, my parents are from Taiwan. When I was about 7, or perhaps 6, it was the first international trip that my parents had brought me on. We went to Taiwan. They are from Taipei, which is the capital of Taiwan. I thought, well, I knew d/Deaf people were in the United States and they had their own sign language, that being American Sign Language, or ASL, but my trip was the first time that I had actually witnessed another sign language. My mom went to a deaf institution [school for the deaf] there and we saw sign language. It was a sign language that wasn't quite mine. It was Taiwan Sign Language. Something was quite different, and I didn't understand what they were saying. The d/Deaf people were signing, and I was quite fascinated. At that moment, I began to realise there are different signed languages in different countries. I began to think, 'Hmm, maybe that's something I wanna do later.' I began studying various signed languages. The problem is that you can't go into a library or a particular place and look at a grammar that has been published. You have many users and speakers of that language. When I got into linguistics, I began to study the language. With sign language though, it's almost impossible to go into a place like that. I happened to meet various d/Deaf people in different countries, and that was really exciting. I thought, 'Where do I meet them and what do I do?' It's something that I kept in my mind, in the back of my mind, until I was an adult. Then, I had the opportunity to travel the world and meet various d/Deaf people."
36,6,Gretchen,You took linguistics at school or how did you get from 'These are so cool' to 'I'm a professor doing this'?
36,7,Lina,"Well, that's another story. Linguistics, I think, for the first time, I heard about it when I went to college. I went to UC Berkeley -- the University of California at Berkeley -- as an undergraduate student. Linguistics wasn't my thing, but I had a friend who was studying linguistics, and they had to take it for their major -- not linguistics itself, but majors like cognitive science or computer science. I, in general, was interested in that. People had to take that to satisfy a major. I had a deaf friend who took a few linguistics courses. The problem was that they said it's really hard. He actually had taken phonology and for some reason had to do a lot of lab work. He was talking about this and I thought, 'Uh, maybe linguistics is the study of, yes, language but for spoken languages only.' That was my first impression."
36,8,Gretchen,How do you do phonology with a signed language? Maybe we're getting off track here.
36,9,Lina,"Well, yes, I didn't know because phonology, I thought, was related to sound and no linguist for sign language. Right, I didn't think there was linguistics of sign language and so I wasn't sure what to do."
36,10,Gretchen,Okay. What happened next?
36,11,Lina,"My major was comparative literature. I was fascinated with reading books during my whole upbringing, and I thought it was interesting to think about that for grad school. At the same time, I wasn't sure. I met other grad students in comparative lit and it didn't seem like they were having fun. Learning more languages is interesting, and that's fun, but learning enough to become fluent in reading literature and then write papers about it and then give presentations and talks, I thought in the beginning, 'Well, yeah, many languages are signed and spoken. Many don't have written systems or components for them.' If I study only the written system, I think that's the tradition of literature. If I wanted to study ASL, for example, then how would I do that in comparative lit? Yes, we do have ASL literature, which I can discuss briefly, but I wasn't really sure what I should do. I dropped the idea of studying that and I thought about something else. After college, I met more d/Deaf people and it just so happened I was living in the Bay Area in San Francisco. There's a diverse group of people, some of whom are d/Deaf migrants. They moved to the United States. They brought their own sign language. I met a lot of these people. I realised as they're learning American Sign Language, you can realise and see at the same time that they have their own accents as their first language from whatever home country they are from and then learning American Sign Language. I can understand the concept of accent in sign language. Hearing people talk about accents from other countries -- parallel idea."
36,12,Gretchen,"If someone's first language was British Sign Language or French Sign Language or something, then they would have a BSL or FSL accent in ASL?"
36,13,Lina,"Yes, yes. And I could see that. BSL -- British Sign Language -- and LSQ, did you say or...?"
36,14,Gretchen,"Well, French Sign Language or LSQ, which is the Quebec Sign Language -- Langue des signes Québécoise."
36,15,Lina,"Yes, yes, LSQ is special in its own right because the language emerged from LSF and ASL because it has regional contact. But there's history to that."
36,16,Gretchen,"I feel like I should know more about LSQ because I live in Montreal, but I don't actually know anything about it."
36,17,Lina,"It's an interesting story because ASL is from Old French Sign Language. Many sign languages of the world tend to -- bring through deaf schools. That's how the language is passed on. That happened with LSQ and ASL. LSQ -- well, let me hold that story."
36,18,Gretchen,"Okay, okay, okay. We'll get that later. We're still in your life story. You met a bunch of d/Deaf friends. They spoke different sign languages. You were like 'They have accents! This is so cool. I'm gonna study this.'"
36,19,Lina,"Yeah, pretty much. I just based my everyday life in socialising with various d/Deaf people and it was exciting. I was fascinated with their accent and, at the same time, the use of everyday language. I was fascinated with their structure, the function of the language, how people talked about various things in everyday life, and how they would tell stories, the poetry, how they expressed complex ideas, just the possibility of talking about anything in sign language. I wanted to study that. I thought, 'Well, what can I do?' As I mentioned, I'm a serious nerd. I read a lot -- total bookworm. I rolled up my sleeves and I looked for a book to see if there's anything written about sign language -- anything about ASL or otherwise. I found one book in fact -- one book. I think it was called -- I forget the exact title -- it was about ASL and linguistics."
36,20,Gretchen,We can link to it in the show notes.
36,21,Lina,"Oh, okay. That would be great. That's how I found my PhD advisor because I read -- and often all the linguistics books refer to other people's work and what have you. I was reading and there was one chapter that talked about a person and how ASL marks first person singular and non-first person -- second or third person, 'you' or 'she' or 'he.' It just so happened they mentioned my PhD advisor Richard Meier, referring to his work on person that he has done. I thought, 'This is very interesting' -- his worked fascinated me -- 'maybe I should apply for the University of Texas in Austin and work with him.' I knew that he had also researched the acquisition of sign language for many years as well. I thought, 'Hmm, that's fascinating. I could learn about acquisition. I could learn about sign language.' My whole life I was fascinated with how d/Deaf people learn sign language because most of us, including me, we're born to parents who are hearing, don't sign, and we learn sign language, then, through meeting other d/Deaf children in school or social events, and got lucky that I met someone who had d/Deaf parents. I was a child when I met my first d/Deaf family, so to speak. I thought, 'Wow! Well, yeah, it's like hearing children. They learn language from their parents and then they actually just are d/Deaf.' It's a rarity in our community."
36,22,Gretchen,You got interested in how d/Deaf kids learn sign language as kids versus with other kids around the same age -- when they learn it from their parents or from other kids?
36,23,Lina,"Yes, exactly."
36,24,Gretchen,Was that your research topic in grad school?
36,25,Lina,"Yes, that was my enthusiasm in getting into grad school. I didn't quite understand what the research meant. I thought, 'Oh, it'd be fun to learn more.' So, I applied at Austin. I didn't realise that grad school was a serious thing -- a serious endeavour for sure. You literally started your career when you applied for grad school. Luckily, Richard accepted me. Then, that began my journey into research, I guess."
36,26,Gretchen,What did you end up doing your dissertation on?
36,27,Lina,"Well, I thought I was going to research how d/Deaf children learn ASL in general terms. It was pretty vague at that time. Then, I took Richard's class on introduction to linguistics of sign language. They talked about various sign languages and the emergence all over the world, and various sign languages that have popped up. We talked about Nicaraguan Sign Language. Many people know about that because it's often referred to and cited in publications, perhaps on radio, and some in film. I was fascinated with the concept of how deaf children can make up their own language in a school, for example, at least in that context. Also, I had heard about other sign languages like ABSL, which is the Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language, which is a very small area with a number of deaf people in Israel. The concept of language emergence not in a school per se --"
36,28,Gretchen,The village sign languages?
36,29,Lina,"Yes, yes, exactly, yes, like in a family."
36,30,Gretchen,"There's a really nice video on YouTube about Nicaraguan Sign Language, which we can also link to if people want the whole story on that."
36,31,Lina,Okay!
36,32,Gretchen,"Yeah, you were looking at all these different kinds of sign languages emerging, and this turned into -- I haven't actually read your dissertation, I'm sorry."
36,33,Lina,"Oh, no, no, no, it's totally fine. Please, don't, actually."
36,34,Gretchen,Many people say this.
36,35,Lina,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, right. I was thinking, 'Well, there's so many interesting topics that I could research. How do I begin? Where do I start?' I didn't realise that to be in the right place at the right time and meet the right person could definitely shape my future. I was thinking about my work and, obviously, Richard wasn't working on Nicaraguan Sign Language at the time, so I thought, 'Hmm' -- well, my department was -- well, I'm sorry -- my old department. I have to back up."
36,36,Gretchen,"Right, because you're at UCSB now."
36,37,Lina,"Exactly. It's hard. My department chair told me, 'Stop saying your 'PhD advisor.' He's not yours anymore.'"
36,38,Gretchen,Because you're all grown up.
36,39,Lina,Exactly.
36,40,Gretchen,"You met Hilaria Cruz, who we did another interview with for Lingthusiasm. And you also started working on Chatino Sign Language or the one that's spoken in her community."
36,41,Lina,"Yes, that's correct. The University of Texas in Austin has a great program for training indigenous scholars. It just so happened that I met a friend, Hilaria Cruz, who was a few years ahead of me in the program. She'd written her name in IPA on the board. I thought, 'Oh, interesting.' Through her I met her sister [Emiliana Cruz], who was also a PhD student at the time in anthropology. Somehow, I was learning about their life story and we got to know each other. We became friends, I guess. It just kinda happened. We'd see each other every once in a while. Then, the three of us were curious about one another because we're all very different. They're from a small community in Oaxaca, Mexico. I'm from Southern California. And I'm Deaf. It's kind of a strange coincidence that we met. They seemed to be fascinated with seeing a d/Deaf person who studies sign language in the linguistics department. That was a new concept, I guess -- a novel concept for many people in general at the time. Perhaps more for them because they have several deaf people in their family who clearly lead a different life than mine. They told me about some deaf people, and I asked them questions. But they couldn't respond, and they said, 'We don't know. You'll just have to come and visit and meet our family and see what it's like.'"
36,42,Gretchen,That's so cute! I love that.
36,43,Lina,"Yeah. That kind of conversation led to one thing, and it was the first opportunity that I thought -- well, I'd never thought that I could fly to another country like Mexico and go in a van, afar, and travel about eight hours in a van to -- maybe it was longer -- and go a whole-day trip to the village. I wasn't really sure, could I go? Could I do the work? I don't wanna be one of those linguists who just shows up and says, 'Hi! I'm here! I'm ready to study you.' We had that conversation. Hilaria and I talked about going to the village. Then, I went, and I continued to go. After a while, I felt ready to begin to work. That's when the visits began. I watched Hilaria and how she worked with them. She recorded them speaking the language from the elders in the village, especially for the new year. It was a fun activity. They had some celebrations. The hours just continued all day and all night. It was really fun to meet some deaf people there. That led me to meet other deaf people in the village. It wasn't just deaf people; it was the whole life of Chatino people and that experience of socialising with people and how they accepted and thought about deaf people. It was very natural. Deaf people don't have access to education there. There's no support for a use of sign language in schools -- in the local schools -- so maybe Hilaria may have mentioned that the schools only use Spanish as the language of formal instruction. That's another problem on top of those who are deaf."
36,44,Gretchen,But they communicate with each other and with their family and friends up in the village?
36,45,Lina,"Mostly just in the family. That's another thing I learned but it took me a while to figure this out -- years, in fact -- that, well, who people talk with is really intentional. Anyone does not speak with everyone. It was interesting. Part of their social life is that everyone is organised within the family and the extended family. Everyone who is in the family, they have kinship. They are in this family unit. It's like a speech community, when you go into and enter a speech community, you have a relationship with one another -- some good, some bad, and some strongly political, different than my life here based on the type of relationship that we have in some ways. It's very similar in that way for the Chatino people. For deaf people, their relationships in the village are strongly associated with family and kinship. That's who they communicate with mostly. I was fascinated to see how they made up signs in order to communicate and to get what they needed for everyday life. It's a little bit different than mine. I work within linguistics all the time. I use very abstract, sophisticated terminologies at times with my colleagues and my collaborators versus using language to make sure that people understand. With most Chatinos, they have their own language. They talk about what is relevant in their life. That was fascinating and that became my dissertation topic after a while, eventually."
36,46,Gretchen,"You were figuring out what kinds of signs people use there, how the social structure fits into that, and all this different stuff?"
36,47,Lina,"Yes, exactly. The most fascinating part was how languages emerges there during interaction. That's my focus -- how it happened in a place that is not a school, not an educational system, it's deaf and hearing people and family members in a group."
36,48,Gretchen,Because hearing people also use these signs as well?
36,49,Lina,"Yes. If they socialise with deaf people mostly, yes. If they live with them, then they definitely do communicate with them -- or if they work with deaf people."
36,50,Gretchen,Did you find that it was like the Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language where they have a kind of village sign language because there's a high proportion of deafness and they have this kind of village sign language? Or is it a different thing from that?
36,51,Lina,"Well, it is different for many reasons. I think the community where ABSL emerged is special because it is a large proportion. It's a village with a large number of deaf people who have been born there and have been in the same family -- so a clan, if you will. People in the community of 3000+ people, there's no other community like that that has ever been discovered. It's quite special in that fact. Where I work is a very small number of people, maybe 10 deaf people in total, I think. That's a big comparison to the Bedouin village sign language. Again, people that I study are mostly related. If you can analyse the family and look at the kinship and the relationships, then they are all socialising together every day. Deaf people in the family mostly have hearing people. They may have some relatives or other siblings. It's not like there are deaf people like there are the Bedouin sign language where there are masses of deaf people within families."
36,52,Gretchen,"Right, okay."
36,53,Lina,"That means that, I guess, if you look at Chatino Sign Language or what I -- in academia you need to name things as separate languages. It's not really called 'Chatino Sign language,' but people who use the language don't have an official name for the language. They say, 'My language' or 'We're just talking.' ABSL and Chatino Sign Language are quite different. Chatino Sign Language is much younger. The structure looks very different. They depend on the family that they socialise with. At the same time, we have overlap with family signs. Everyone knows one another. Language is common. The family signs feed one another if you can say that. The community has conventional gestures that kinda feed the family signs as well. Many things are happening at the same time."
36,54,Gretchen,"Is it kind of like the home sign system that was at the beginning of Nicaraguan Sign Language -- when Nicaragua established the first school for the deaf and all the people came from different villages and saw they each had their own home signs, and then they came in and developed Nicaraguan Sign Language because of the school?"
36,55,Lina,"That's one way of looking at it, yes. My feeling is that home signs -- what psychologists and linguists call 'signs' of one deaf child in a family that they make up in the home -- I think there's a lot more diversity to how home signs emerge because, again, it depends on the interaction, whether you have one deaf child, or you have several deaf children, or deaf plus hearing interacting with one another using sign language."
36,56,Gretchen,"This one's different because they have 10 deaf people, and they're all interacting with each other, and so they can feed back into each other?"
36,57,Lina,"Well, yes and no. They don't identify as deaf -- culturally Deaf. It's not a common [=universal] belief. I'm not saying that it means that they don't have an identity. It just means they identify themselves as a family member first. Then, they identify as a member of their community second. Everyone recognises that they are different from other indigenous people who are not Chatino because of how they dress, the type of rituals that they perform in their daily life, etc."
36,58,Gretchen,That's really interesting.
36,59,Lina,"Also, I guess, to recognise the difference between them and other Chatinos within in the area. Deaf people do interact with their families, who are related. They visit one another. They will meet and talk, or they'll go to the same family events, parties, community events, etc. If their family isn't connected, then they have less chance of meeting another deaf person if they're not in the family. If you have two deaf people meet at random on the street, they may say 'hello' if anything."
36,60,Gretchen,Because you don't talk to people outside the family?
36,61,Lina,"They may not talk to one another. I'm sorry, say that again."
36,62,Gretchen,Because they don't talk to people outside the family or there's more restrictions on that?
36,63,Lina,I think it's because maybe they don't like each other.
36,64,Gretchen,"Okay. Okay. That's fair. That's really neat. Since your dissertation, you've also kept going back to this community, were there this summer, and then you're still doing more projects?"
36,65,Lina,"Yes, for my dissertation I did focus on -- I have to remember; that was a long time ago -- yes, eight girls -- four deaf, four hearing -- all girls, it just so happened. Of the eight, they are among five families, two types of groups that I study -- deaf children with hearing parents and hearing children with one deaf parent. The communities don't have deaf families. They don't have two deaf parents with deaf children. They don't have anything like that. That's very rare in the world in general, even rare in ABSL, in that community. I studied how they interact and how the languages emerge, of sign language, how it happened. That was mostly my dissertation. I did go several summers, stayed one year at one time, and that was the only way for me to take full advantage of being immersed in the community and within the sign family. I went in each family. I stayed for a bit. I slept there. I ate with them. I visited with them. Then, I went to one of the ranches that they have and just did the daily activities and daily life with them. Then, I had to finish my dissertation. That took a while."
36,66,Gretchen,"Yeah. You've also done some work on ASL as well, right?"
36,67,Lina,"Yes, after I graduated, I got a post-doc for two years at UC San Diego. I had an opportunity to work with Carol Padden, who is well-known for her work on ABSL and ASL. At that time, I took advantage of the opportunity to work on ASL. Let me back up. I have worked with Richard on ASL, focusing on verbs. I love verbs. It's one of my favourite things. As a postdoc, I thought that was a wonderful opportunity to expand my research on ASL to collaborate with Carol Padden to compare Chatino Sign Language with ABSL, the use of space for grammar as a specific unit of study -- for a unit of analysis. ASL specifically has something that I've noticed, which is very interesting, about things on the internet. More d/Deaf people are filming themselves using sign language and then posting it on Facebook, YouTube, and various social media sites. It seems to be exploding recently. People will film themselves in the car. They have privacy. They can talk, and post, and people watch, and then they film themselves sometimes in responding. You can see a huge explosion with signing videos."
36,68,Gretchen,Because you can study these videos?
36,69,Lina,"Yes, yes. The data is there! I can see data before my eyes. It's in action. I never thought for a moment that there could be another data given on the internet. It's right there."
36,70,Gretchen,You don't have to go out with a camera and film yourself.
36,71,Lina,"Exactly. It's a perfect point if you think about it. You can't go into a library and look for grammar. You have to look for d/Deaf people. One challenge that is unique to sign language, I think, is to look for d/Deaf signers out there in general. For some researchers, they bring d/Deaf people into the lab and they film them signing. But for me, I don't do that. As a Deaf signer, I feel that language happens in the natural when you're communicating and interacting with people. It's a hard role for me because when I go to see my friends, or go to a deaf event or a conference, and I see sign language research and people getting together to talk about things, they're not just going up -- I can't bring a camera and say, 'Here I am,' and film. I have to keep these things in the back of my mind. Interesting things do occur there. It's a huge dilemma for me because I don't want to bring d/Deaf people into a lab artificially and film them. I find what they do in a lab is not natural."
36,72,Gretchen,"You have the observer's paradox. Once you start observing something or filming it, that it changes."
36,73,Lina,"Exactly. That's an ongoing problem. I think everyone knows that it becomes -- people are aware that they're in a lab being videotaped. Deaf people are very well-adapted to being able to meet researchers or hearing signers and -- what do you want from me? What can I do to accommodate you? How can I answer this question? It's a common problem with some of my hearing friends who look at me as a signer with other d/Deaf friends. They say, 'You don't sign that way with me, as a Deaf person. Why are you signing that way?' I say, 'Oh, I didn't mean to. It's not intentional. I code switch.' For hearing people, you change how you speak. I think some hearing people do that too. It's not only a second language user thing. I think it's just you have academic register, you have typical, everyday conversation and chat."
36,74,Gretchen,"This is kind of like the classic sociolinguistic -- you go into a department store and you ask someone, 'Where is the shoe section?' You're gonna write that down rather than bring them into the lab and say, 'Excuse me, can you tell me where is the shoe section?' It's gonna be a very different response."
36,75,Lina,"Yes. Back to the internet data -- and I thought, as I'm watching films, 'This is a wonderful opportunity to research because d/Deaf people are filming themselves.' It's very powerful."
36,76,Gretchen,They're filming themselves for other d/Deaf people?
36,77,Lina,"Exactly. I think the concept of monologues in how they film themselves is not exactly how I would describe the film I'm watching because they're signing, and they're talking, and they're responding to what someone else has said. It's a little bit different than a monologue. The point, I thought, when looking at this data is that I could use videos to analyse. I could look at them and what they're saying, and they could pick whatever they wanted to say and do their own video. At the same time, they're signing naturally and spontaneous."
36,78,Gretchen,"This was the focus of your talk at the Five-Minute Linguist at the LSA last year, which was really good. I really enjoyed that."
36,79,Lina,Exactly. You remember that? I'm embarrassed about what happened because the first video that I showed didn't quite work out.
36,80,Gretchen,"You recovered really well. That's the thing with live events. Yeah, we can link to the video of that, which is also online, if people wanna see what you found when you looked at YouTube and how people sign on YouTube."
36,81,Lina,"Yes, what I talked about in the Five-Minute Linguist talk was showing how the video has evidence of how one verb 'to look at' changes the meaning. You can see the different functions and the different form. That is what I found from watching all these videos. That verb and how to analyse it has kept me busy. I think the internet data helped me understand it much better because it truly represents language in the d/Deaf community."
36,82,Gretchen,"I mean, it's so cool because this is what I like about internet data as well. You can look for a new word on Twitter or something and like, 'Look! There's real people using it.' You don't have to wait until it gets entered into a dictionary or until some lexicographer finally notices it and does it. It's just right there -- people using it."
36,83,Lina,"Yes, exactly. It's also a good opportunity to see what signs d/Deaf people are inventing or how they're playing with signs, nuances, talking with deaf friends about certain things that they've seen on Facebook, or teaching me new signs, new concepts. I think that that is how language spreads and changes because it's true for spoken language as well. Languages change -- and written too."
36,84,Gretchen,It's great to actually have high-quality video that people can send back and forth to each other rather than TTY or something.
36,85,Lina,Yes. I'm impressed that you know what 'TTY' means and used it effortlessly.
36,86,Gretchen,"Haha I was like, wait, did I get that acronym right?"
36,87,Lina,"Yeah, thinking about my first quarter -- I just finished my first quarter at UC Santa Barbara -- one undergraduate student who was learning about ASL, I suggested that they could watch a DVD. They said, 'Oh, can I watch it online?' And I thought, 'Yeah, okay. DVDs are old now.' Talking about VHS -- what's that? I mentioned VHS and I thought, 'Oh, what is VHS -- oh, never mind, never mind, never mind.'"
36,88,Gretchen,Imagine shipping VHS to each other to communicate in video. The internet's a lot easier.
36,89,Lina,"Yeah. Back then, d/Deaf people had to communicate through TTY. The problem with TTY is that it looks like a small typewriter. You have one line that has the words and then you wait for the person to say, 'Go ahead.' Then, when they're done, it's your turn, and you type back. They do have -- had -- paper, a little printout that you could read. I remember one common joke is sometimes you read it, and you didn't understand, and then you would wait until you met the person again, and then you'd show them the paper and say, 'What did you say here? What does that mean? Tell me. Sign it to me.' Then, they'd do it and then it'd be totally clear because you're like, 'What does this mean?'"
36,90,Gretchen,It's like really bad texting.
36,91,Lina,"I think that's a good parallel, yes. Then, the internet emerged, and texting is so different now -- and easy. We still can text, and then now we can add video texting. We can add emojis."
36,92,Gretchen,Gifs.
36,93,Lina,"Yes, exactly. Oh, gifs -- love my animated gifs."
36,94,Gretchen,I noticed you use a lot of gifs on Twitter.
36,95,Lina,"Yeah. Well, people do, too."
36,96,Gretchen,"Oh yeah, everyone does."
36,97,Lina,"I think what's fascinating is that people sometimes say, 'How do I interpret that gif?' So, we talk about it. It's the same thing with emojis because I noticed that the iPhone is adding new emojis all the time. I send something and my friend, regardless of hearing or d/Deaf, would look at it and go 'What's that? Are you cold or what? What does that mean?'"
36,98,Gretchen,"It's like TTY, you'll have to wait till you see them in order to find out."
36,99,Lina,"Yeah. Yeah. The availability of the video -- or rather for that kind of thing through technology -- is something that we cherish. We can communicate so easily now. If we can't physically meet a person face to face, then it's much easier. Back then, we had to physically get together to communicate with one another."
36,100,Gretchen,It's so great.
36,101,Lina,"Yeah. The internet allows me to possibly research on a new level. I still love interacting with d/Deaf people in person. But it allows my research to be conducted easier. I don't have to bother d/Deaf people in their daily life, ask them to come to the lab, and then film them and feel like they're staring at me or the camera. It's artificial. At the same time, I do tell people, 'Oh, I love your video that I saw online. Do you mind if I use it?' Sometimes, they're like 'Oh, yes! Thank you. You like my video? That's so exciting,' and they feel really good about themselves."
36,102,Gretchen,"That's so good. It's so exciting to get to do this episode as a video because we had a number of requests to say, 'Can you do something about signed languages?' We didn't wanna do that in audio. That's weird. I'm really happy that you were able to join us. I think that pretty much brings us to the end of where we're going, but if there was one thing you could leave people knowing about linguistics or about signed languages or anything you work on, what would that be?"
36,103,Lina,"Wow. I have so many messages. Let me pick one. Well, it is 2019. I think the world is changing. Deaf children have, in some ways, more opportunities than they did before. Here, at least in the United States, deaf children can go to any school. We have interpreters available to them. They can also learn to speak and hear with technology sometimes, more than they used to in the past. I wrote a book chapter about that."
36,104,Gretchen,We'll link to it.
36,105,Lina,"Yeah. The opportunity for d/Deaf children to learn with cochlear implants, to speak and listen, is fine. I don't think it means that that should happen to preclude learning sign language because deaf people and the deaf community want to tell the world we are not opposed to the concept of deaf children learning to speak or to use any residual hearing. We love bilingualism. We love bimodal people who can write, who can sign, who can talk. The more communication, the better! But to learn sign language is vital. There is no harm in learning sign language as a child. One argument that I've heard time and time again is people in the world don't sign. They say, 'What should we learn for?' You can make the same argument for many spoken languages that are not around the world. Why learn to speak Chatino? Well, if you think about it, the argument breaks down so easily because at no point will learning multiple language harm anyone. You can apply that to sign language. Maybe you don't think about it in that view, but if you think about it as a language that we can claim as ours and make it special to us as deaf people, emergent sign languages represent a beautiful facet of biodiversity. I love signing because it's fun, but I feel that it's something special about me. It represents who I am. I want people to understand that it's not about the language that they need to know for living in the world or travelling to a specific society, but it represents who you are. You can decide to use it or not. I think for deaf children at large, they should have the opportunity to learn sign language. Then, it's up to them whether they use it or not. When you interview people about spoken language of various different ones -- a beautiful IPA scarf, I love. I had it. And weird symbols. It's just beautiful. But I would ask the audience to think for a moment what makes language a language that's not related to sound or sign. It's something I've been thinking about for a very, very long time.[Music]"

37,1,Gretchen,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics! I'm Gretchen McCulloch."
37,2,Lauren,"I'm Lauren Gawne. Today, we're getting enthusiastic about language and smell. But first, we're heading into our November anniversary!"
37,3,Gretchen,"Yay! Three whole years of Lingthusiasm. In celebration of that we are -- as we have done for all our anniversaries -- we are trying to help more people than ever find the linguistics enthusiasm that we know and love. Most people still find podcasts through word of mouth. This year, we've thought of something to help talk about it."
37,4,Lauren,We want to help people find Lingthusiasm by sharing with them what makes linguistics so great. We're asking you to share a thing that you've learnt from Lingthusiasm over the first three years of episodes.
37,5,Gretchen,"If there's a fun fact, or a story, or an anecdote that you find yourself retelling or mentioning to people, that would be a great thing to post on social media or to tell someone about, 'Hey, there's this podcast that's cool! Here's something I learned from it.' It's also really helpful to us because, Lauren, you and I have been doing linguistics for quite a while and we sometimes forget which things aren't new to us but are actually new and exciting to other people. Help us remember which things are new and exciting for you to learn about!"
37,6,Lauren,"If you can't think of one in particular, because there're so many great things that you've learnt on the show, stay tuned to our social media. We'll be retweeting and sharing other people's facts so you can get some ling-spiration."
37,7,Gretchen,"You can also reshare anybody else's facts that you would like to co-sign. We've noticed that some of our biggest growths in listenerships have been from other people pointing out interesting things that they've learned recently. We thought we'd try to do that more formally for the anniversary. Share something interesting you've learned, something you find yourself retelling to other people, and other people will realise this is where they can get more stuff like that."
37,8,Lauren,"I love every anniversary we come back and encourage people to share their lingthusiasm, because every year we have been growing. We have been reaching new ears. Maybe you are new ears since our last anniversary. Maybe you have been with us since Episode 1. We're always excited to encourage new people to discover that linguistics is fun and interesting and relevant to their everyday life."
37,9,Gretchen,We also have another new Patreon bonus episode. This one is about surnames. Listen to this and support the show on Patreon. You can also share your stories about where your surname comes from and any linguistically interesting things that happened to you because of your surname.
37,10,Lauren,"We talk about the origins of 'McCulloch' and 'Gawne' in that episode. We also have over 30 bonus episodes for you to listen to. That's almost half the number of shows. If you've listened to the whole main episode back catalogue, there's almost as many episodes again waiting for you over at the Patreon."
37,11,Gretchen,"There's your solution for 'Oh, no! I've listened to all the Lingthusiasm episodes. What do I do now?' The answer is -- go listen on Patreon. There're lots of things for you still to listen to. Thank you if you've been supporting us on Patreon already."
37,12,Lauren,You help us keep the show ad-free and ticking along. We also have exciting new Lingthusiasm merch for you.
37,13,Gretchen,"By popular demand, you can now get lingthusiastic socks!"
37,14,Lauren,I'm very excited about the socks.
37,15,Gretchen,"All three of our prints -- the International Phonetic Alphabet, the tree structure diagrams, and the esoteric Unicode symbols -- are now also available on socks, in addition to the scarves, and ties, and mugs that they were previously available on."
37,16,Lauren,We have multiple patterns. We have multiple colours. You can buy them along with all of our existing merchandise. We also have greeting cards that say 'thanks' and 'congrats' in IPA as well as some other greetings.
37,17,Gretchen,"If there're any linguists that you need to thank or congratulate as the year winds to a close, that is something you can now do. Plus, and get this -- I'm really excited about this -- we have water bottles that have the glottal symbols from the IPA on them. They are glottal bottles. I'm so pleased."
37,18,Lauren,You can get your nice glottal bottles for your water. Or it's even more satisfying if you're the kind of the person who says 'water' with a glottal stop in the middle of 'water.'
37,19,Gretchen,"Or 'bottle' with a glottal stop there too. They have the glottal stop, the glottal fricative, and the voiced glottal fricative. People won't know that's what they are until you tell them. I'm so pleased!"
37,20,Lauren,"Finally, we have new T-shirts and mugs that say, 'Linguistic correctness is just a lie by big grammar to sell you more grammars.'"
37,21,Gretchen,"To check out the full set of Lingthusiasm merch, which there's quite a lot of at this point, go to lingthusiasm.com/merch. It makes a great gift for the linguist or linguistics enthusiast in your life. [Music]"
37,22,Lauren,"Gretchen, what is your favourite smell?"
37,23,Gretchen,"Ooh, there are so many good smells. I really like the smell of rose. I also really like the smell of almond. It depends on whether you're talking about to wear or to eat. I also really like spicy scents."
37,24,Lauren,Almonds as in fresh almonds or almond blossoms?
37,25,Gretchen,"No, almond extract that you bake with."
37,26,Lauren,Okay.
37,27,Gretchen,Yeah.
37,28,Lauren,Like marzipan.
37,29,Gretchen,"Well, yeah. Or like amaretto, or vanilla extract but almond. It's so good. I could eat/smell that forever. What's your favourite smell?"
37,30,Lauren,"This one always slightly startles people in the northern hemisphere, but I love the smell of freshly cut grass because it reminds me of Christmas, which I think says a lot about how frequently my family ever got around to mowing the lawn."
37,31,Gretchen,"I mean, I agree. The smell of freshly cut grass is really good. I didn't think of that one. There's also the smell of the earth when it rains. But it doesn't really remind me of Christmas. The smell of new-fallen snow reminds me of Christmas -- also a great smell."
37,32,Lauren,"Hmm, not a smell that I know or identify as readily."
37,33,Gretchen,"Oh, it's a very distinct smell. The smell of crisping leaves in the fall -- also very good smell."
37,34,Lauren,"We have not as many of them, but we have a particular kind of lemon gum tree in Australia that always smells really amazing on campus just before the academic year starts in February/March. Whenever I smell that smell, I get really excited because it means classes are gonna start soon, we're gonna have students back on campus, and it reminds me of undergrad days and starting university. For me, smells are often really linked -- I mean, clearly, if two of my smells are really linked to particular times and places for me."
37,35,Gretchen,"Yeah. I was just kind of looking around my house thinking, 'What smells good around here?' Then, when you start getting the time and place, I'm like, 'Oh, yeah. That leaf smell in the fall is also very back to school for me,' or the distinct smell of each season, like the spring smell, when everything is melting -- also a nice smell."
37,36,Lauren,It says a lot about English that we have to be like 'the smell of spring' or 'the smell of freshly mown grass' or 'freshly fallen snow.' We kind of just don't have the best vocabulary for talking about smells -- other than referring to the thing that they relate to.
37,37,Gretchen,"Yeah, and I'm thinking of this because when you asked me, 'What's your favourite smell?' I was like 'Oh!' I have a ready answer to what's my favourite colour, but I don't have a ready answer to what's my favourite smell because it's not something that we think about in terms of the abstract smell-ness of it. I'm not like, 'Oh, my favourite colour is the colour of pomegranates' or something because I can actually just name that colour."
37,38,Lauren,"It would be funny, though, if you're like, 'My favourite colour is the red of strawberries and not the red of cherries.'"
37,39,Gretchen,"Exactly! Or, 'The orange-y red of a sunset, but not a neon light, but like the sunset.' We do that for smell. That's how we talk about smell."
37,40,Lauren,"There's a long literature on the way that we talk about smell and that smell is maybe not as complicated as the other senses. But in a lot of ways, that's a very culturally driven thing. In fact, as we'll talk about in this episode, there are other cultures where scent is a lot more a part of the language and it makes it a lot easier to talk about it."
37,41,Gretchen,"Is this an English thing, or a European languages thing, or what's the...?"
37,42,Lauren,"It seems to be one of those weird European things where, if we actually look at a wider diversity of the world's languages, things are a lot more interesting. When I say 'we,' I mean a group of linguists, and particularly Asifa Majid, who works on the relationship between language and smell."
37,43,Gretchen,We're gonna be citing Asifa Majid a lot in this episode. Go follow her on Twitter.
37,44,Lauren,"All of her work is really great. I mean, there were some broad studies around smell, so we know that experts tend to be better than novices at smelling smells."
37,45,Gretchen,How does one become a smell expert? Is this a thing I can do?
37,46,Lauren,"If you are a perfumer, or if you work with wine. Although, apparently, if you work in a particular industry, you might be very good at smelling wine, but it doesn't make your ability to smell flowers necessarily any better."
37,47,Gretchen,"Oh, really? This is very domain-specific smell expertise -- 'smexpertise""?"
37,48,Lauren,'Smellspertise.'
37,49,Gretchen,'Smellspertise.'
37,50,Lauren,Yeah.
37,51,Gretchen,"I would sign up for this job. Like, 'Oh, I get to drink a lot of wine and smell it. I get to eat a lot of chocolate and smell it.'"
37,52,Lauren,I think it's one of those jobs that's great in theory and then when you've smelled 500 chocolates...
37,53,Gretchen,"That's true. It's probably like video game tester, where you're like, 'Actually, this is not as fun as what I signed up for.'"
37,54,Lauren,"I think being a linguist is as fun as I signed up for, so maybe there's some people who are super enthusiastic about smelling chocolate."
37,55,Gretchen,"I'll stay being a linguist and just eat chocolate in my spare time. Experts are better than novices, and pollution can affect the way we perceive smells."
37,56,Lauren,"Yeah. Maybe part of why you're not as sensitive to smell as -- if you're in an olfactorily noisy environment. However, there was a study that looked at perfumers who work in perfume shops -- you know how you walk into a perfume store or a cosmetics store and it's like --"
37,57,Gretchen,This wall of perfume smell.
37,58,Lauren,Yeah. That doesn't seem to affect people in that workplace. They can kind of deal with that.
37,59,Gretchen,"Oh, so it becomes the kind of white noise of smell in their background, and then they can distinguish between perfume smell still."
37,60,Lauren,Yeah. Which makes you realise just how clever human brains are.
37,61,Gretchen,"That's good! Because if I make cookies or something, first, my apartment just smells like cookies, but then afterwards, if I leave and come back, I'm like, 'Oh, it still smells like cookies here.' But if I stay in there, I stop noticing it."
37,62,Lauren,"Then, of course, there are another group of people who are relatively good compared to the population at discerning smells and they are people who have odour- colour synaesthesia."
37,63,Gretchen,Ooh! I have other synaesthesias but not odour-colour.
37,64,Lauren,"Yeah, we've talked about synaesthesia a bit in other episodes. At its most basic it's where your brain takes in one sensory bit of information but also processes it as though it's another bit of sensory information. There are people who, when they smell things, register it as a particular colour."
37,65,Gretchen,"Right. I guess this kind of makes sense to me because I have grapheme-colour synaesthesia, so when I see particular letters or numbers, I also see colours associated with them. I can see how one could have smells associated with colours, but I think for me it would just be like, 'I'm picturing the thing that it smells like,' and that's probably not actually what the synaesthesia is involved."
37,66,Lauren,They studied people who have this synaesthesia compared to regular old sniffers like me and found that they were more consistent and accurate at naming odours.
37,67,Gretchen,Interesting! Okay. Cool. Let's talk about some of these languages that actually do have more odour terms than English does.
37,68,Lauren,"Yeah. Obviously, synaesthesia is something that affects people randomly in the population. Then, there are these cultures in which there are far more words and terms for talking about smell. That seems to have implications as well for how smell is used in these languages."
37,69,Gretchen,"Right. One of these languages is Tepehua. Specifically, Huehuetla Tepehua, which I hope I'm pronouncing right but I'm not completely sure. This is a language spoken in the state Hidalgo in the eastern Sierra Madre in the central Gulf Coast region of Mexico -- named after the town where it's spoken. It's related to some other languages that are spoken around there. This is a really interesting paper with Asifa Majid and some people who work on this language in particular. They did an elicitation study on particular scents. They found 23 specific groups of scent words in this language. They catalogued them according to what types of things they correspond to. They're often smells you can kinda recognise but that in English we don't have specific names for those specific smells."
37,70,Lauren,Awesome. Can we hear some of these smell groups?
37,71,Gretchen,"Yeah. It's a really interesting list because some of them are really delightful and some of them are really bad, and there's really not much in between. Group Number 1, which is /ʔuli/ or /k'uli/ or /sk'uli/ -- there're all various different versions of that sound -- which is a delicious smell like flowers, or perfume, or floral, citrus. It isn't just specifically a floral scent. It has this sort of positive connotation and this sort of rich, beautiful odour. But in contrast, there's another smell group, which is Number 6, which is a different kind of delicious odour, and this is /kan/ or /kani/ or /kanini/. This is the delicious and beautiful odour which might smell like clove, or might be kind of fruity, or might be describing the delicious odour of a free-range chicken that eats corn instead of chicken feed."
37,72,Lauren,Right.
37,73,Gretchen,I think this one may be a little bit more food-like.
37,74,Lauren,Bit more savoury.
37,75,Gretchen,"Yeah! They're both really good. There's another one, /k'us/, which is also a beautiful odour, but a slightly different beautiful odour. Again, English just doesn't have the vocabulary for this. In contrast, there's this Group 10, which is /ɬkih/, or /sʔeh/, or /ʃʔeh/, which is a delicious savoury odour like when shrimp or mushrooms are boiling, the smell of coffee or recently wet earth, incense, food, honey or sugar cooking, frying meat, beans, but sometimes also used for an unpleasant smell like skunk, human farts, burning plastic, or burning garbage. This one is a little bit more controversial."
37,76,Lauren,"Hmm, wow. That one definitely covers a gamut."
37,77,Gretchen,Yeah.
37,78,Lauren,"Asifa also did some work with researchers who work on Cha'palaa, which is a language of Ecuador in the Barbacoan family. Similarly, they found these smell terms that kind of have a meaning that we know immediately as a group -- and some similar ones. There's one for things that are sweet-smelling or perfume, which is 'pindyu,' and then 'andyu' is for fragrant and good food -- and like another positive term. The one that really caught me is the smell 'chijdyu,' which is the smell of burning hair."
37,79,Gretchen,"Oh, wow. That was what this /ʃʔeh/ smell can also be burning plastic or burning hair, burning feathers, burning bones."
37,80,Lauren,"It's one of those smells that as soon as you smell it you just know if you've ever accidentally put your hair too close to a hair dryer or near a fire. We don't have a good word for it. We have the word 'the smell of burning hair.' It's not that we can't smell it and we can't describe it. It's just that we literally use the word 'hair' and 'burning' to describe it. Whereas, these words don't necessarily directly relate to those words."
37,81,Gretchen,"It's like the difference between saying 'the colour of strawberries' and 'red.' You can still talk about the colour of strawberries but you don't have a specific cover term that covers strawberries, and tomatoes, and apples, and fire engines, and these kinds of things."
37,82,Lauren,The really nifty thing about this is that they not only recorded the specific smell vocabulary items -- there's about 14 so far recorded for Cha'palaa -- but they also turn up more frequently in narratives than descriptions of smells in English in similar narratives.
37,83,Gretchen,"Oh, that's really neat. I also really enjoyed how sometimes they draw connections between smells that I wouldn't have thought of as related. Then, when you say that, I'm like, 'Oh, yeah. These are related.' This kind of aromatic smell or also painful smell, which is /ɬkak/ or /ɬkakak/ in Tepehua, is a spicy or strong smell like peppermint, eucalyptus, lime -- like calcium hydroxide, not like a lime citrus. One of the descriptions is it's so spicy or strong that it'll make you sneeze. It's kind of grouping together something that I wouldn't necessarily have immediately grouped together. This is something else that I really enjoyed about this Tepehua paper is that they also describe the methodology for how they went about getting this list of smells. Because, of course, 'Can you translate these English words?' is not necessarily a good way of doing smells in particular because English doesn't have the word to translate necessarily. Instead, they used these tools called 'Sniffin' Sticks.' There's no G there. It's 'Sniffin' Sticks.'"
37,84,Lauren,The apostrophe there is very important.
37,85,Gretchen,"Of course, when I looked it up on the website, like, 'What are Sniffin' Sticks?'"
37,86,Lauren,"I mean, we got really excited. We were like, 'Should we have practiced this methodology ourselves? Should we get some of these and smell them?'"
37,87,Gretchen,"Yeah! Sniffin' Sticks, apparently, are these little plastic tubes that look kind of like a marker, and you think maybe of those scented markers that maybe you had when you were a kid. Did you have those?"
37,88,Lauren,We had those. But this is like those but more science.
37,89,Gretchen,"Those but science, because they don't smell like artificial cherry. They smell like real smells -- high quality smells -- and not always pleasant smells because you don't just want a whole bunch of fake fruits. You want a bigger range."
37,90,Lauren,They also smell really consistently across all of the sticks and they have the same intensity of smell.
37,91,Gretchen,"Yeah. Because I was thinking, well, maybe instead of buying the Sniffin' Sticks for €200 from this website, maybe I could just make my own."
37,92,Lauren,This is where the plan came to a quick end.
37,93,Gretchen,"It was like, 'Maybe we should get some Sniffin' Sticks, Lauren.' And then it was €200. Later, 'Maybe we're not gonna get Sniffin' Sticks.' They have very specific flavours. Instead of buying some essential oils and dabbing them on a bit of cloth or something, these are all very controlled. They're for things sometimes that don't necessarily have an essential oil associated with them. Some of the flavours include -- would you like a list of flavours?"
37,94,Lauren,Sure.
37,95,Gretchen,Okay. Orange.
37,96,Lauren,Yum.
37,97,Gretchen,Leather.
37,98,Lauren,Hmm.
37,99,Gretchen,Cinnamon.
37,100,Lauren,Hmm.
37,101,Gretchen,Peppermint.
37,102,Lauren,Mm-hmm.
37,103,Gretchen,Banana.
37,104,Lauren,Hmm.
37,105,Gretchen,Lemon.
37,106,Lauren,Yeah.
37,107,Gretchen,Liquorice.
37,108,Lauren,Okay.
37,109,Gretchen,Turpentine.
37,110,Lauren,"Ooh... Actually, no. My mom used to do oil painting, so I'm very weirdly nostalgic about turpentine."
37,111,Gretchen,Okay. Garlic.
37,112,Lauren,Mm-hmm.
37,113,Gretchen,Coffee.
37,114,Lauren,Lovely.
37,115,Gretchen,Apple.
37,116,Lauren,Great.
37,117,Gretchen,"Clove, pineapple, rose, fish."
37,118,Lauren,Gahhh.
37,119,Gretchen,"This is the lunchroom smell. Flower in general. Like, I don't know what the difference is between that and these specific flowers but, okay. Pear, like the fruit."
37,120,Lauren,Yeah.
37,121,Gretchen,"Cola. I guess like Coca-Cola or something? Lilac, /lɑɪlɑk/ -- how do people say this word? I've been corrected on this word before."
37,122,Lauren,I say /lɑɪlæk/.
37,123,Gretchen,"I say /lɑɪlɑk/. It's okay. Grapefruit, grass -- there's our freshly cut grass smell -- raspberry, honey, ginger, coconut, lavender, melon, peach, mushrooms, smoked meat."
37,124,Lauren,Mmm.
37,125,Gretchen,"There's your savoury smells. Chocolate, onion, menthol, soy sauce, sesame oil, caramel --"
37,126,Lauren,Yum.
37,127,Gretchen,-- and eucalyptus.
37,128,Lauren,What an emotional rollercoaster.
37,129,Gretchen,"Yeah. It's a really interesting list. They're fairly pleasant smells. Some of the smells that I was seeing in the list of smells from different languages were things like the odour of sweat, or fermentation, or disgusting odour like rotting meat. They don't seem to be forcing people in the lab to smell skunk or rotting meat, which I think is very nice of them."
37,130,Lauren,Very kind.
37,131,Gretchen,"There are some more savoury smells like smoked meat, and leather, and sesame oil, and stuff like that."
37,132,Lauren,"Obviously, the Sniffin' Sticks have a lot of advantages in terms of the consistency, and they're portable and can be shared very easily. Apparently, they last for at least a year, according to the manufacturer."
37,133,Gretchen,"So, it's more efficient than just getting a slice of lemon and putting it in a jar."
37,134,Lauren,"Well, you say that, but there's another smell research paper that I read -- and I have a summary of it on my blog from a few years ago, I'll link to it -- but they were looking at whether people had an association between particular odours and colours, even if they weren't people who had synaesthesia. To do this, they looked at English speakers and they looked at speakers of Jahai, which is a language on the Malaysian peninsula that does have a really rich smell lexicon, to do this study, because they were looking at things like coffee and banana and coconut that both groups might recognise, but they were also looking at smells that only each group might recognise. They had peanut butter for the English speakers and galangal, which is a really nice aromatic that would be familiar to the Jahai speakers but not the English speakers. They put them in plastic bottles with little spray things on top, like you use for cleaning, and would just kind of spray the air from the bottle at people."
37,135,Gretchen,"Waft some smell. I mean, okay. I guess this works if you don't have €200 to buy some Sniffin' Sticks, you can get a lemon and put it in an empty spray bottle and spritz it."
37,136,Lauren,"They did this to look at whether people associated particular colours with smells. When they recognised it, they would if it was -- like for the smell of coffee, they would think of brown and for the smell of banana, they would think of yellow. Again, kind of showing that our ability to think about smells is tied to the objects that we're smelling more than the smells independently. Whereas, Jahai speakers were much better at identifying smells. They use smell a lot. They're hunter- gatherers. It's much more part of their daily life skill set."
37,137,Gretchen,Have a very rich smell vocabulary.
37,138,Lauren,Yep.
37,139,Gretchen,"I noticed on the Sniffin' Sticks website, which again I can't quite get over, but they actually have a smell training kit."
37,140,Lauren,"Oh, excellent!"
37,141,Gretchen,"Which contains four vials smelling like lemon, rose, eucalyptus, and clove. I don't know why they picked those particular ones. I just wanna read you this description because it's really good. 'The different sticks contain odorants from everyday life, which can enlarge your sense of smell. Will be delivered in a box with cotton hand gloves. The idea that our sense of smell can be improved via training might at first seem strange, but the more you think about it the more it makes sense. Going to the gym and lifting weights can improve muscle mass and tone and practicing the guitar regularly will hopefully improve proficiency, so will spending time sniffing odours. Estimated results starting after six to nine months.' Of regularly sniffing these plastic vials."
37,142,Lauren,"What? I mean, in that time you could just learn to speak Jahai."
37,143,Gretchen,"You know, that one's only €49. I'm tempted, but I think maybe I'll pass. If anyone has given yourself a course in smell training, please let us know how it goes. You can enrol in a wine tasting course for a similar amount of price, I feel like. Lauren, you're the one that suggested that we do an episode about smell. How did you get into smell?"
37,144,Lauren,"I mean, I'm always been a fan of our sniffers' work -- I think is probably the very first reason that I get really excited about language and smell. I got an opportunity to apply all the feelings that I have about scent in language when I wrote a constructed language for P. M. Freestone's Shadowscent fantasy series, which has been so much fun."
37,145,Gretchen,"So, there's a book that has a conlang in it, and you made the conlang?"
37,146,Lauren,Correct.
37,147,Gretchen,"Like, a smell conlang."
37,148,Lauren,"Shadowscent is set in a world that has a lot more focus on scent. P. M. Freestone is one of those people that has, I think, a very acute sense of smell. I think because smell has been so central for her life, a lot of this story is set around scent. Even when the story is not set around it, the writing is so beautifully evocative of smell in a way that a lot of English language writing isn't."
37,149,Gretchen,"She came calling and said, 'Hey, can you help me with the language aspects of this book'?"
37,150,Lauren,Yes. I got involved early enough that I also got to make sure that all the characters and the place names were internally consistent with the language.
37,151,Gretchen,"Oh, yeah!"
37,152,Lauren,"Once you start doing linguistics, it can sometimes be -- I refer to this as the 'Khaleesi' problem. When George R.R. Martin wrote Game of Thrones, the word 'Khaleesi' -- it's spelt K-H-A-L-E-E-S-I. But the problem is, English speakers say E-E and I the same way. If you actually listen to Dothraki, the language from Game of Thrones, it's pronounced /xəlɛɪsi/. But no English speaker pronounces it that way."
37,153,Gretchen,"Right. English speakers who give their kids the name 'Khaleesi,' they don't call them /xəlɛɪsi/."
37,154,Lauren,Yeah.
37,155,Gretchen,"You end up having to kind of reverse engineer a weird system for the language if you have somebody get involved for the conlang too late. Whereas, if you do it really early, then you can make sure that all the character names are internally consistent."
37,156,Lauren,Yeah. David J. Peterson talks about the challenges of -- and the complexity of -- working with a series that was already multiple books in. I'll link to some of that. I had the luxury of coming in early and creating the language so that it fit the place names and the people names that also could be involved in creating the full language as well.
37,157,Gretchen,"I've read this book because it's available in the UK now. Even though it isn't out in North America, you were able to send me a copy because it's coming out this month -- next month?"
37,158,Lauren,In November.
37,159,Gretchen,"Because it's coming out in November. I read it and I was expecting -- because you were talking about the language, like, 'Oh, every other page is gonna have full paragraphs of this language! I'm gonna have to do a lot of decoding in order to do this,' which I was excited about, but also a bit nervous about."
37,160,Lauren,"I feel like I would say I'm sorry to disappoint you, but actually, the book is such a great romp that we didn't need to be held down with linguistic puzzles on every other page."
37,161,Gretchen,"I mean, I enjoyed the story a lot. Clearly, there's gotta be a lot of work that you put in behind the scenes that you don't actually get to see in the pages of the book."
37,162,Lauren,"The glacier is always a good metaphor for this kind of work where there's an incredibly large amount of figuring out the mechanics of the language that happen behind the scenes. We have a dictionary. I have the basics of the grammar. Then, you have this tiny bit at the top that you actually see come through in the book."
37,163,Gretchen,Can you tell us -- because I think I speak for everybody here that your average Lingthusiasm listener is also gonna be more interested in the language aspects than the average reader might be -- can you tell us more about what's actually in this language that doesn't necessarily appear in the pages?
37,164,Lauren,"Sure. There's a couple of translational tidbits in Volume 1 of Shadowscent. But I was interested in creating a language that was really true to the world that it was spoken in. Knowing about this work with Cha'palaa and Jahai, and these languages that have much more of a focus on scent than English does, I wanted to do justice to it. There are two schools of thought when you create a language. There's the people who try and strive for natural languages that make as much sense within what we know about what human languages do. Then, there are people who make artificial languages that deliberately go against what we know human languages can do. For a lot of what I did with the language of Aramteskan, which is the language in the books, is a lot of it fits with what we know about human languages. It has a set of sounds that you would expect to see in a possible human language. It has a lot of grammatical features that are very exciting because I want it to be a bit more playful and create a language that doesn't really exist when we look at what happens with smell in the world's languages."
37,165,Gretchen,"Oh, that's so interesting! The sounds are pretty vanilla, to use a scent metaphor, but the words for smell -- like when we talked about these other languages that have these rich inventories of words for smell -- it's got a lot of these. It also does some stuff that natural languages, as far as we know, don't do?"
37,166,Lauren,"Yes. One thing is I just made sure that there were lots of verbs for 'to smell.' Because in English was have -- you can 'smell,' you can 'sniff,' but there's not a really rich vocabulary."
37,167,Gretchen,You can 'olfact.'
37,168,Lauren,"'To olfact.' I created a whole bunch of different verbs. There's only one verb for 'to move.' You don't 'run.' You don't 'walk.' You don't 'stroll.' You just move. That's not very exciting. But I have verbs for 'to smell something slowly for a long time,' 'to smell something by wafting it,' 'to accidentally smell something and then discover that it's disgusting and it's too late,' which I feel like is a feeling we've all had before, 'to smell something that you can remember but you can't immediately place.'"
37,169,Gretchen,"Ooh! Like the tip of tongue phenomenon, but the tip of the nose phenomenon."
37,170,Lauren,Yeah. 'To smell something with great enthusiasm.'
37,171,Gretchen,This is delightful.
37,172,Lauren,"I'm always expanding. If there is any form of 'to smell,' I can create a word for it."
37,173,Gretchen,"Hmm, okay. I'll have to put my thinking cap on."
37,174,Lauren,"If you have any particular forms of smelling, I'm always -- it's one of those areas of vocabulary that I'm just adding to all the time."
37,175,Gretchen,"What about 'to smell something and you're not sure if it's disgusting or not'? You're like, 'Maybe that's a good smell. Maybe that's a bad smell.' You're just kind of smelling it experimentally."
37,176,Lauren,"Hmm, yeah. You know what? I'm gonna add that."
37,177,Gretchen,Because I was thinking about this from our list when we were looking through the things from other languages and some of the words really kind of bordered on 'is this disgusting or not?'
37,178,Lauren,"It's one of those things where some people find the smell of durian or other really pungent fruit really pleasant and other people don't. Some people have this moment of like, 'Ugh! I don't know!' That's a really great one. I'm gonna add that to the language."
37,179,Gretchen,Excellent. I feel so proud I had a contribution.
37,180,Lauren,"Then, one of the other things that I did is we talked a lot about how all of our words for smells are like, 'It smells like burned hair,' or 'It smells like an orange.' As many of the vocabulary items as I could in the language are 'the smell.' The basic vocabulary item is 'the smell of oranges.' Then, you have to change that word to come up with 'the thing that smells like oranges.'"
37,181,Gretchen,"Oh, wow! Okay. That's really interesting. If you wanna talk about actual oranges, you have to say, 'the thing that smells like oranges.'"
37,182,Lauren,Yes. Flipping the whole thing on its head.
37,183,Gretchen,"That's great! It's like how some languages, their adjectives have the shapes of verbs. Whereas, in other languages their adjectives are a little more like nouns or something. This is like everything is scent-derived as much as possible. Do you want to talk about the scent evidential? In a previous episode, we talked about how languages have different strategies for introducing sources of knowledge. You can say, 'I witnessed this myself,' 'I heard it second-hand,' 'I deduced it from the available evidence.' This seems like a really good place to introduce some sort of smell thing, right?"
37,184,Lauren,"You will be unsurprised to know, given that evidentiality is something I have worked on for a long time and thought about for a long time, I couldn't resist putting grammatical evidentiality into this language."
37,185,Gretchen,For smell.
37,186,Lauren,"But Aramteskan has an evidential system that does not exist, that we know of, in any human language."
37,187,Gretchen,Yes! Thank you for not disappointing me.
37,188,Lauren,"A lot of human languages will have like, 'I know because I sense this using any of my senses,' or 'I know this because I saw it,' and then they might have another form that is used for all the other senses. In Aramteskan, we have 'I know this because I smelt it,' or 'I know this because I used one of my other senses, which aren't as important or interesting.' This divide is definitely not -- I mean, I don't think there's any language we've come across so far that has a specific grammatical evidential just for smell, let alone one that has one for smell and prioritises it over all the other senses."
37,189,Gretchen,"This is delightful. Even though this is not actually in the pages of the book, you can kind of feel this additional attention to sense and smell kind of permeating the manuscript -- or wafting from it."
37,190,Lauren,"Yes. As well as the lovely wafting scent of printed books, if you buy the paper version."
37,191,Gretchen,That's true. There is that smell. Maybe there's a language that has a better word for that. Maybe they could print it with those smell marker Sniffin' Sticks and then you could scratch and sniff the entire book. Have you thought about suggesting this to P. M. Freestone?
37,192,Lauren,"Ah, it would be so amazing."
37,193,Gretchen,"It would be really expensive, I'm sure. Pay €200, get this scratch-and-sniff version of Shadowscent. This is not available. I'm making this up. But maybe this is something you could get."
37,194,Lauren,"It would be so lovely. Even if you have to DIY the smell environment, Shadowscent: The Darkest Bloom, as it's known in the UK, is out there now. Shadowscent, as it's known in the US, is out November 5. It has a lovely hardback and a map in it in the US edition. That's gonna be super fancy. Book 2 will be out in 2020, I believe."
37,195,Gretchen,"Cool. I'm looking forward to Book 2. Yeah, maybe I'll just have to kind of DIY my own scent experience for the book. [Music]"

38,15,Lauren,"Okay, Gretchen, it's grammar time."
38,16,Gretchen,Okay.
38,17,Lauren,What is the difference between these two words? You ready?
38,18,Gretchen,Okay.
38,19,Lauren,The first one is 'book.' And the second one is 'books.'
38,20,Gretchen,"Oh, I know this one! I know this one. We're good. Okay. The first one is when you just have one book and the second one, 'books,' is when you have more than one book. How did I do?"
38,21,Lauren,You did great! Congratulations.
38,22,Gretchen,"Okay, good. Thank you. I am a speaker of English."
38,23,Lauren,Your English-speaker intuitions are working as expected.
38,24,Gretchen,"That's good to know, seeing as we're speaking English right now. This is plurals. Sometimes, you have just one of something. You have a singular. Sometimes, you have a plural of something. In English, the kind of classic way that you form a plural is by adding an S or this /s/ sound to the end of a word."
38,25,Lauren,"We've talked about morphology in a previous episode, which is where you add bits to a word to create more meaning. Plurals are just a really nice bit of morphology in English. I'm very fond of them. I like being able to distinguish between whether I have one book or many books."
38,26,Gretchen,Hopefully all the books.
38,27,Lauren,"Yes, ideally more than one book. I think that's the appeal of plurals."
38,28,Gretchen,"More than one book. More than one cake. It just makes everything better. But there are also other ways of making plurals -- not just by adding an S or a /s/, /z/ sound if you have /dagz/. In English, sometimes you make the plural by -- for example, if I have the word 'foot' and I have the word 'feet,' Lauren, what's the difference between these?"
38,29,Lauren,Hmm. I'm just gonna observe that there is no S there. The second word definitely means more than one foot.
38,30,Gretchen,"It does because English also forms the plural by changing the vowels sometimes, particularly for words that go back to Old English and have this -- what's called the 'Germanic Ablaut Pattern' -- but of changing the vowels to indicate a different sort of grammatical thing. The fact that some plurals in English form by changing their vowels was actually really helpful to me back when I was studying Arabic in undergrad because in Arabic, sometimes you add an ending to make something plural. But in a lot of cases what you actually do instead is you change all of the vowels, and sometimes even the associations of how many vowels there are or which consonants come together. For example, if you have the Arabic word /kita:b/, which means 'book,' there's also the word /kutub/, which means 'books.' So, in this case you've changed the /i/-/a:/ vowel pattern -- that's a short /i/ and a long /a:/ -- to just two short /u/'s -- /kutub/. /kita:b/. /kutub/."
38,31,Lauren,Hmm. It's a little bit like English 'foot' and 'feet.'
38,32,Gretchen,"A little bit except that it's changing two vowels for the price of one. In this case, it's a bit more complex as a whole system. This is definitely an oversimplification to say that it works the same way as 'foot/feet,' but the fact that the vowels change is something that's kind of neat. One thing that I found particularly interesting about this system is that it can also apply to words that get borrowed into Arabic. Arabic has the word /fals/, which means 'money,' and the plural of it is /fulu:s/. You take this F-L-S set of consonants and, instead of just having the single A there, you have /u/ and then a long /u:/, okay?"
38,33,Lauren,Right.
38,34,Gretchen,"That's fine. Then, Arabic borrowed the word 'bank' from English, which is pronounced /bɑnk/."
38,35,Lauren,As in a money bank?
38,36,Gretchen,"Like a money bank, not a riverbank. The plural of /bɑnk/, because it looks kind of like /fals/ -- it's got a consonant and then an A and then two more consonants -- so the plural of 'bank' in Arabic is /bunu:k/, like /fulu:s/. You put /u/ and then long /u:/ in between the three consonants."
38,37,Lauren,How clever.
38,38,Gretchen,"I always enjoy it so much when languages take a word from another language and then adapt it to the morphology of their language and say, 'Okay, we figured out how to plural it. We know how to pluralise words like this. We're gonna do this the way that our language does it.'"
38,39,Lauren,"In fact, Nepali borrowed the word /kitab/ from Arabic and, instead of using the Arabic form of the plural -- in Nepali you have 'one /kitab/' but you have 'two /kitabhæɾu/.' They also have a suffix at the end of the word, like English does, but they don't use the Arabic form of the word. If you're listening to people speak Nepali every day, you can often hear 'two /kitab/' and it's just as grammatical as 'two /kitabhæɾu/.'"
38,40,Gretchen,"So, it's not like in English where the S is obligatory if something is plural. You can just put the /hæɾu/ if you want it or if it's necessary, but you can also omit it?"
38,41,Lauren,"Yes. Whereas, Hindi, which also borrowed /kita:b/, Hindu has obligatory plurals. So, 'one /kita:b/' and 'two /kita:bɛ̃/' -- closely related languages, you can't trust them to always have the same obligatoriness or not."
38,42,Gretchen,"What's interesting, Arabic was very influential in a lot of different areas because another language that borrowed the word for 'book' from Arabic was Kinyarwanda, which is spoken in Rwanda. It slightly adapted the form of the word. Instead of being /kitab/, it borrowed as 'igitabo' because Kinyarwanda really likes words to begin and end with vowels. In Kinyarwanda, there's also a prefix 'igi-' which means that something is singular and belongs to a particular class. If you wanna make something that begins with 'igi-' plural, you change 'igi-' to 'ibi-'. So, 'igitabo' is 'book' and 'ibitabo, with the B, is 'books' because you always change 'igi-' to 'ibi-' to make something plural. They just took the same pattern that they had in their language and said, 'Yeah, we can do this with this word from this other language.'"
38,43,Lauren,What an exciting life the word /kita:b/ has had.
38,44,Gretchen,It feels very poetic that the word for 'book' travelled around a lot. It was a technology the way that a lot of languages have borrowed the English word for computer. A lot of languages borrowed the Arabic word for 'book' because they were some early people to have books.
38,45,Lauren,"So far, we've had you can put a suffix on the end of a word. Kinyarwanda has some prefixing at the start of the word, so where the morphology is. Arabic and sometimes English involve some internal changes. You're not necessarily just adding or removing something from the start or the end. These are some of the strategies for pluralising, but they're not the only ones."
38,46,Gretchen,What else can we do?
38,47,Lauren,One thing that I find very satisfying as a plural strategy is where you repeat the word and the repetition is what makes it indicate that it's a plural.
38,48,Gretchen,"That's very economical. It makes a lot of sense. It's like saying, 'book' and 'book book' to mean 'several books.'"
38,49,Lauren,Yeah. Indonesian is one of the widely spoken languages that does this. The word for student is /muɾid/ but the word for 'students' -- plural -- is /muɾidmuɾid/ as one option for how to pluralise it.
38,50,Gretchen,Huh. Very nice.
38,51,Lauren,There's something very visual about that form of plural that I find very satisfying.
38,52,Gretchen,"Speaking of languages that form their plural with a prefix, there's actually an analysis of French. Traditionally speaking, if you learn French in school, you learn French forms a plural by changing the ending the same way that English does. But in actual fact in French, often those S's at the end are silent pretty much always."
38,53,Lauren,Right.
38,54,Gretchen,"So, there's another analysis of French whereby it's actually that the plural is a prefix. This especially shows up in French words that begin with vowels. Children who are learning French before they learn to read and write, they often assume that many words in French that begin with a vowel actually have plural prefixes. If you take, for example, the word 'ami,' which means 'friend,' in French and the plural of it is also 'amis' but with an S at the end, but you can't hear the S."
38,55,Lauren,"No, I could not hear that."
38,56,Gretchen,"It is completely silent. There is nothing to hear. Most of the time when you say a word in French, you put another word in front of it. Especially for a noun, you're often gonna put an article like 'the' or 'my' or something in front of it. You would say, 'l'ami' -- 'the friend' -- 'les amis' -- 'the friends.' That's 'les,' which is the plural form of 'the,' but it has this S that's silent. Because that silent S is before words that begin with a vowel, you pronounce that S like a /z/."
38,57,Lauren,Huh. Yeah.
38,58,Gretchen,"The same thing with 'my friend.' You have 'mon ami,' 'mes amis.' Again, that A makes the S in 'mes,' which is also the plural form of 'my,' be pronounced as if it's actually there."
38,59,Lauren,"I can totally see how, as a child..."
38,60,Gretchen,"You can see where this is going, right, because you don't actually speak French and you're like, 'Uh-oh! It really sounds like the singular is 'ami' and the plural is...'"
38,61,Lauren,'Zami.'
38,62,Gretchen,"Exactly. 'Zami.' You get little kids -- it's really cute when they're learning to write. It'll be like 'Me zami' and they'll write, like, Z-A- M-I for 'friends.'"
38,63,Lauren,Okay. That is too cute.
38,64,Gretchen,"I have friends who post this is what their young children are doing on Facebook, like little notes that they're writing for class, they're talking about 'le zami.' It's so cute."
38,65,Lauren,"Kids are just great little paradigm analysers, aren't they?"
38,66,Gretchen,"Well, this is the way that language change could happen because you could imagine if French wasn't a written language or if, you know, some sort of catastrophe happened and French people just weren't writing anymore -- you had an area of French where they had stopped writing for a while and they started writing again -- you could imagine that people would've reanalysed it at this point. This is actually what's marking plural in the spoken version of French even though the writing is preserving this other thing. If you were to start writing it differently in the modern era -- not looking at what it did historically -- then it would be very sensible to say that the plural is actually 'zami.'"
38,67,Lauren,I think it's also worth mentioning that there are plenty of languages that get by just fine without any plural morphology adding onto words at all.
38,68,Gretchen,"Yeah, absolutely. But I think all languages have some way of expressing whether there're different amounts of stuff. The question is just do you do this as an intrinsic part of particular words, or do you do this with extra words. You could say in English, 'One book. Two book. Many book. A few book.' These words would convey, also, that there's more than one book as well."
38,69,Lauren,"This is what a lot of Austronesian and Pacific Island languages do. They get by, obviously, completely fine. For example, Tetun, which is the language of Timor, if they need to mark something as plural, they'll just use a separate word which is 'sira' or 'they.' So, again, they're using the determiners a bit like French children use when they can't hear the difference between the plural and the single form."
38,70,Gretchen,"Yeah. I mean, spoken French just completely uses the determiners to indicate what's plural. It's just in the writing."
38,71,Lauren,We've talked about determiners and how they have a lot of work to do for tiny words. This is just another thing they get to do. Overachieving.
38,72,Gretchen,"Sometimes, your 'the' word can take on that function instead. Or you can use overt number words. Or you can do things like, you know, for English words like 'rice' or 'bread' you end up using things like 'loaves of bread' or 'grains of rice,' 'cups of rice,' 'glasses of water"" because saying 'rices' or 'waters' or 'breads' is a different thing and refers to kinds of rices and breads rather than specific bread items."
38,73,Lauren,"We've talked about different strategies different languages use to make plurals. When we look at this across a lot of languages and see what languages do, what we're doing is typology, Gretchen. I don't know if you knew that's what you were doing right now."
38,74,Gretchen,"We are doing typology, yes. There is a very cool website if you're interested in linguistic typology which is the World Atlas of Language Structures or WALS. They have all these interesting maps pulling information from all these different grammars of all these different languages and putting it on a map so you can see how many languages have prefixes for their plurals versus suffixes for their plurals versus something else."
38,75,Lauren,"Because plurals are one of those things that every grammar describes, if a language has plurals, even if it doesn't, it's such a common feature across the world's language, it's often relatively easy to describe. It means that WALS has -- it's one of the biggest parts of the survey. It has over a thousand languages, which means that one in seven of the world's languages are included in the survey, which is pretty impressive."
38,76,Gretchen,"It is pretty good. Not all languages even have grammars written of them or have been converted into WALS, but that's a pretty high ratio for WALS."
38,77,Lauren,What do you think is the most common strategy in the survey of making plurals?
38,78,Gretchen,"Well, as a very Anglocentric person, I'm gonna say suffixes?"
38,79,Lauren,"You are correct. I don't know how distributed the survey is. It could just be if you look at the map and where the plural suffixes are, it is really obviously an Indo-European/Europe kind of area phenomenon."
38,80,Gretchen,"Yeah. So, it's not quite clear if that's just Indo-European languages are more likely to be in WALS in the first place, which is definitely true. If we actually just had grammars for the thousand languages of Papua New Guinea, probably this ratio would shift."
38,81,Lauren,"But plural suffixes are very common. The next two most common are plural words -- so not using any kind of morphology -- and plural prefixes -- so putting something on the start of the word rather than the end. Of course, that's not the only options that you have."
38,82,Gretchen,What are some of these other options?
38,83,Lauren,"We talked about reduplication already. You can have a change in the tone of a word. There are some African languages that have systems where the tone or the pitch of the word changes depending on whether it's plural or not, which is obviously very different to something like Mandarin tone, which more people are familiar with, where the tone can change whether it means a particular thing at all. This is used grammatically."
38,84,Gretchen,That's really interesting. I didn't know people used tone for that. Another one of my favourite less-common types of plurals is when you just have a completely different word that means 'the plural thing.'
38,85,Lauren,"Ah, yeah. That is super great."
38,86,Gretchen,"It's a huge pain if you're trying to learn the language because you're like, 'Okay, great. So, instead of memorising this one list of nouns and then saying, 'I add this thing to them. Now, they're plural.'' You're like, 'Now, I have to memorise two lists of nouns and all of their associations with each other.' It's a bit of a pain. But once you know it, it's very satisfying to be like, 'Oh, yeah. Actually these are what were once historically completely different words and now just one of them is the plural of the other.'"
38,87,Lauren,"It would be a very interesting language to have this feature, Gretchen."
38,88,Gretchen,"I don't know if there are any languages that do this for all of their plurals, but I think there're quite a few languages that do this in a few edge cases. One of them is English. English singular is 'person' and the plural is 'people.' Those are historically completely different words."
38,89,Lauren,This thing happens across languages so often and across different parts of grammar that linguists call it 'suppletion' because one form just completely takes over and suppletes the part of the paradigm where the other one would be.
38,90,Gretchen,"It's the same thing that happens in things like the English verb 'to be,' which is 'be, am, is, are, was.' Why do some of them have B's in them and some of them have W's and some of them have neither? It's because they were once three different verbs."
38,91,Lauren,Just crashing into each other.
38,92,Gretchen,Yeah. But that's verbs. We're not in verbs right now. We're in nouns.
38,93,Lauren,"I think 'people' and 'person' is a really good reminder as well that even though English would just fall into the WALS category of a language that has plural suffixes with the S suffix, it doesn't mean that it doesn't occasionally use these other things like 'foot/feet,' which is just a modification internal to the word, or 'person' and 'people,' which is the suppletion, or 'sheep' and 'sheep' where there's no change at all."
38,94,Gretchen,"There are some words like that in English: sheep/sheep, moose/moose."
38,95,Lauren,Emoji/emoji.
38,96,Gretchen,"'Emoji' is a really interesting one because some people say, 'emoji/emoji,' and some people say, 'emoji/emojis,' which kind of brings us to the English side of do you adapt the plural for the way that you do it internally in a language? In which case, it would be 'emojis.' Or do you make it more similar to what the source language does? In which case, it would be 'emoji' because Japanese does not have the English plural strategy of just add an S to it. One of the strategies that it does have, among others, is just keep the word the same. I think the best-known example of do you do the source language versus the target language in terms of plural in English is a certain little creature with eight legs."
38,97,Lauren,The octopus.
38,98,Gretchen,The octopus.
38,99,Lauren,Which I just avoid talking about in the plural at all to save myself a grammatical crisis.
38,100,Gretchen,"I admit that I have also done this. If you were gonna pluralise 'octopus' as if it's English, it would just be 'octopuses.' It's very easy. But there's a fairly long-standing tradition in English of when a word is borrowed from Latin to make the plural the actual Latin thing. Because, historically, many English speakers did learn Latin, and so you want to show off your education by using the Latin form even though it's in English. So, if you're going to pretend that 'octopus' is Latin, then you wanna say, 'octopi.' However, there is yet a third complication, which is that 'octopus,' in fact, is actually Greek -- 'octo' meaning 'eight' and 'pus' meaning 'feet.' So, Greek does not make these plural by adding i to it. In that case, there has recently become popular a yet even more obscure and yet even more pretentious, to be honest, plural."
38,101,Lauren,"Is there where you say, 'octopodes'? (/akta'ˈpodiz/)"
38,102,Gretchen,"Well, this is where I used to say, 'octopodes.' But I have recently learned that, apparently, it is, for maximum pretentiousness, /ak'taˈpodiz/."
38,103,Lauren,You've out-pretentioused my out-pretentiousness.
38,104,Gretchen,"I know, right? Which just sounds like, I dunno, like 'Sophocles' and 'Euripides' and like another Greek playwright because, I guess, they are all Greek, to be fair. But 'octopodes' really, really sounds like he should be writing some plays."
38,105,Lauren,I'm looking forward to your Greek tragedy about octopuses... About those octopus-things.
38,106,Gretchen,Sea creatures of all kinds.
38,107,Lauren,"We've been starting to explore the different options that you have for plurals across languages, which is part of why linguists do typological surveys to see other potential things that languages can do. But I find this kind of typology work is not just useful and interesting as a linguist doing linguistic analysis, it's also a really handy way to think about language if you're learning a language."
38,108,Gretchen,"When you're learning a new language, it's interesting to be more aware of sort of the space, or what are some things that some languages do, so that things are less of a surprise to you if a language that you're learning does something slightly differently. One of my favourite things in languages doing things differently is also that some languages don't have this singular/plural distinction. They make other kinds of distinctions in how many of something there is."
38,109,Lauren,"Yeah. So, so far, we've been looking a lot at the form and where it goes or how it changes the word and if it's compulsory or not. But there is just more than single and plural. Between one and many, we have some languages that create specific forms as well. We have some languages that mark there're two of something, which is known as the 'dual,' as in the 'duo'-type dual rather than the fighting-type duel or, depending on your accent, the glittering one."
38,110,Gretchen,"I mean, duels are also done with two people, I guess. You fight a duel between two people."
38,111,Lauren,Yep. Fair call.
38,112,Gretchen,The dual tense is fascinating to me because Old English had a dual.
38,113,Lauren,Really? We squandered it?
38,114,Gretchen,"Yeah, we squandered it. Except, there are still a few words that are relics of the Old English dual that we use all the time in modern English."
38,115,Lauren,"Really? Is this gonna be one of those, like, now-my-eyes-are-open-I-can't-un-see-this moments?"
38,116,Gretchen,Yeah. They're not even obscure.
38,117,Lauren,Okay.
38,118,Gretchen,"Lauren, what's the different between 'both' and 'all'?"
38,119,Lauren,'Both' and 'all'? 'Both' means 'two' and 'all' means 'everything'?
38,120,Gretchen,"Yeah! So, if I say, 'Both of us went to buy some books' versus 'All of us went to buy some books,' 'all' means 'three or more.' You can't use it for 'two.' 'All of us,' you and me, Lauren, 'went to buy some books.'"
38,121,Lauren,No.
38,122,Gretchen,No.
38,123,Lauren,Ahh...
38,124,Gretchen,Another one is 'either' versus 'any.'
38,125,Lauren,Hmm... 'either' is a choice between two.
38,126,Gretchen,'Either of you can come.'
38,127,Lauren,And 'any' is a choice between more than two. I can't force a definition of 'any' that includes only two.
38,128,Gretchen,Yeah. Yeah. 'Any of you two can come.' You just can't say that.
38,129,Lauren,"No. Ah, wow! I have this tiny space in my brain that works as a dual and I never even thought about it."
38,130,Gretchen,The third one is gonna be really obvious. You also have 'neither' versus 'none.'
38,131,Lauren,"Right, yeah."
38,132,Gretchen,"So, if 'either' does it, 'neither' also does it. Some people insist on a plural/dual distinction between 'between' and 'among.' Whereas, other people don't have this distinction."
38,133,Lauren,That's what that distinction that they're trying to get at is.
38,134,Gretchen,"Yeah. But English doesn't really have a dual anymore, so do we still need it in these particular words? There is still one in 'former' versus 'first' and 'latter' versus 'last.' 'I read this book and that book, and the former was really good, but the latter wasn't very good.' You can't do that with a list of three."
38,135,Lauren,"Hmm, yeah."
38,136,Gretchen,"Again, those are more obscure. 'Both' and 'all' and 'either' and 'any' just really blew my mind."
38,137,Lauren,Yeah. Because my intuitions are so strong there.
38,138,Gretchen,Right! Imagine if we did this everywhere in the grammar. We used to have pronouns -- more of the pronouns used to have singular and dual and plural forms in English. 'I' and 'we two' and 'we all.'
38,139,Lauren,"We sneakily haven't talked about pronouns at all because, obviously, pronouns don't just whack an S on the end of things the way that most normal nouns do. English doesn't even have a grammaticalized distinction anymore between plural and singular in second person -- 'you' and 'you' -- which is why people innovate things like 'yous' or 'ya'll.' Formal English doesn't have a distinction."
38,140,Gretchen,"Yeah, formal English doesn't. 'You guys,' 'you folks' -- yeah. The pronoun system is different, and we did a whole episode with pronouns earlier. But, yeah, English used to have a dual, like, everywhere."
38,141,Lauren,Amazing.
38,142,Gretchen,"In fact, Proto-Indo-European, the ancestor language of English and most of the other languages spoken in Europe -- with the exception of a few, and some of the languages spoken on the Indian subcontinent -- it had a dual. There are a few other Indo-European languages that still have it or still have relics of it. One of them was Latin, which had some fossilised forms like 'ambo,' which means 'both.' If you're 'ambidextrous,' you have both hands are the right hand. Also, had relic forms in Old Irish, Homeric Greek, Old Indo-Iranian, and Old Church Slavonic. There are still a few dual forms in Slovene and Sorbian."
38,143,Lauren,"If dual forms encode 'two,' you'll never guess what they call it in languages where it encodes 'three.'"
38,144,Gretchen,Some languages have a trial.
38,145,Lauren,These include Austronesian languages and Austronesian-influenced creole languages including Bislama and Tok Pisin.
38,146,Gretchen,"That's great. They also have a dual, right? You have a singular, a dual, a trial, and then a plural after that?"
38,147,Lauren,"In the pronoun systems, yes."
38,148,Gretchen,"Just in the pronouns, okay."
38,149,Lauren,Pronouns -- obviously because they're counting people. People tend to make a lot more distinctions and keep them in pronouns.
38,150,Gretchen,"I should say there are other languages besides Indo-European that do have duals. Inuktitut and Yupik have dual forms. Greenlandic doesn't even though it's related but it used to. In an entirely different part of the world, Khoekhoegowab and other Khoi languages have duals in some forms. There are duals around the world."
38,151,Lauren,"There are some trials, but that is the most. No one has ever come across, in natural languages, something like a quadrial, which would be marking for..."
38,152,Gretchen,"Quadrial, quintial, sextial, septial..."
38,153,Lauren,"This is why typology is interesting. When you find there are lots of languages with single and plural. There are some languages with dual. There are even fewer with trial. And we've not got languages that mark a specific number of anything more. We do have languages that mark something that means 'a few,' so something that's more than two but less than lots."
38,154,Gretchen,"I really like this because English kind of does this in our measure words. You can say, 'one' of something or a 'single' amount of something. You can say a 'couple' or a 'pair,' which is two -- sometimes, occasionally extended to mean more than two. Like 'I'll be there in a couple minutes.' If you're there in three minutes, meh, I think that's still in the thing. People will really argue about this one. Then we have things like 'a few' or a 'handful' or 'a bit.' Then we have things like 'many' and 'several' and 'a lot,' which approximate the system as well. Some languages do this in the grammar."
38,155,Lauren,"Yeah. Some do it in the form of grammar from all over the world. It's definitely not one of those it crops up a lot in this language family or that language family. It shows up in Hopi in North America, Walpiri in Australia, languages of the Oceanic area, apparently in Arabic for some nouns, and it's so common that it actually has its own term, which is 'paucal.' P-A-U-C-A-L. It's a very satisfying word to say, 'paucal.'"
38,156,Gretchen,I really like the word 'paucal.' You can look at number by a strict sort of counting. You can look at number by 'a few' and 'a lot' and 'many.' Are there any other ways of looking at how many of something there are?
38,157,Lauren,I may not have been completely upfront with you when I gave you the Nepali example about books.
38,158,Gretchen,Okay.
38,159,Lauren,"I can point at three books and say /kitabhæɾu/, but I could also point at three books, a couple of notebooks, and some pens and say /kitabhæɾu/, and it would still be technically correct."
38,160,Gretchen,"So, /kitabhæɾu/ doesn't just mean 'books' -- because I can't use 'books' to mean the plural of 'pens' also."
38,161,Lauren,'Books and associated materials.'
38,162,Gretchen,"Ah, like 'books and stuff.'"
38,163,Lauren,"Yeah. The Nepali plural is not only optional, as I said at the start, but it also has a slightly broader meaning in a lot of contexts. I could say, 'Gretchen-/hæɾu/' and it would be like 'Gretchen and her family and associated peoples.'"
38,164,Gretchen,"Is this like when you say, 'Wishing you and yours a Happy New Year' or something like that?"
38,165,Lauren,Yes.
38,166,Gretchen,'You and yours' is like 'you and your family' or kinfolks or people that are associated with you?
38,167,Lauren,"Yeah. Whatever that semantic meaning you have, that's kind of what /hæɾu/ is doing in these sentences."
38,168,Gretchen,"Huh, that's really interesting."
38,169,Lauren,"It's a very elegant way of representing. We know you kind of mean 'this generally related content.' One of the really nice things about plurality is that it's often something that is very easy to see in how it's marked and how it's used, so you can use things like Google Translate to play around. You can look at examples in things like children's books. And you can begin to analyse plurals a bit like a linguist does as you're learning them and going about understanding a new language. Having a little bit of terminology around what the typological possibilities are with plurals can make it a bit easier to approach them in a new language."
38,170,Gretchen,"I watched a demonstration of a monolingual fieldwork scenario where you have no language in common with someone -- and this was set up as a demo because the people did have a language in common but they set it up as a demo for the audience -- and they pretended they had no language in common and tried to figure out some things about the language from the volunteer. It was really interesting because it's fairly easy to ask somebody, you know, here's a stick. Here's two sticks. Here's three sticks. You can kind of point at them, and people can generally figure out what you're asking, and they can answer that. It's one of the easiest areas of a grammar to start approaching, rather than getting into more complicated stuff about hypothetical scenarios and this kind of thing. It's an easy thing to learn at the beginning when you're starting out learning a language. [Music]"

39,6,Gretchen,"When we talk about kids learning language, we often get really excited about a baby's first word. But before kids can even get to that first word, let alone first sentence stage, they're already doing something that's really cool linguistically. That's having conversations."
39,7,Lauren,"I'm already having great conversations with a kid who doesn't have any words yet and that's because she can participate in that back and forth, and taking turns, and I make a noise and then she responds. And then I -- as a good, supportive parent structuring her through her language acquisition -- will respond as though she's given some kind of opinion, 'Ah, oh, really?' I love it when grownups are like, 'Ah, that's interesting,' at kids because they're kind of motivating them through learning this skill of having conversations."
39,8,Gretchen,"I love it. I mean, suddenly, all my friends are having babies now. So, I'm beginning to practice this kind of pseudo-conversational skill with a lot of different small kids. You also see fun videos of this on the internet. There's these two twins in a kitchen. They seem to be having this nonsense conversation back and forth with each other. There's one with a dad who's having this conversation with his kid and he's responding to the kid as if it's a real conversation. The kids are learning something from that."
39,9,Lauren,"Those videos get me every time. I love it so much. One thing they're doing is using intonation, which is that way of changing the tone and the melody of your voice. Nicole Holliday talked about that in our Episode 13 on intonation. We do other things to show people that we want to speak or that it's their turn to speak -- and how we build conversations like this. There's a whole field dedicated to studying this from the perspective of linguistics."
39,10,Gretchen,"Yeah. Conversation analysis is such an interesting subfield of linguistics because a lot of us think about the sounds or the words or the sentences, but there's also this broader conversational level where there are also interesting patterns going on. A thing that I found most satisfying about encountering conversation analysis was how understanding how there are different cultural conversational norms, which helped me navigate different kinds of conversations that I was having in different kinds of norms that other people were having, even if you're all speakers, ostensibly, of English. Even if you're speaking the same language, you can have slightly different conversational norms depending on your personality type, or what region you're from, or various other factors. Understanding those more explicitly can help make those conversations more rewarding."
39,11,Lauren,"Conversation analysis has definitely helped me through holiday season, family conversations, interacting with small kids, job interviews, all of these places where back and forth conversations happen. Understanding them from what's happening on the linguistic level is a really useful way to think about conversation."
39,12,Gretchen,"Yeah. Travel, when you're interacting with people from different backgrounds and stuff like that, also really helps with that. There's this great metaphor that gets used with conversation, which is already present in English in general, that conversation analysts have really seized on, which is the idea that conversations have a floor. When you have the floor, you're the one who's talking. So, I have the floor right now --"
39,13,Lauren,"I could interject, and I could take the floor. The metaphor is from places like parliaments where there is a literal speaking area on the floor where a person comes to and does the speaking. In formal contexts there are formal ways to officially take the floor, so to speak. If you've been in high school debating, you'll know that the person has to walk to the middle of the room or stand up. If you have been to Parliament, you'll see where they physically walk to on the floor to speak."
39,14,Gretchen,"Even in less formal contexts, like when you start going to school and you get taught you need to raise your hand before you talk, that's a way of saying, 'We've got 30 people in here and the only way to manage the floor is to do some sort of more formalised things.' Because, by default, the teacher has the floor. Or in some contexts you have something like a talking stick that you can pass around and that also helps signal who has the floor."
39,15,Lauren,"Those formal ways of showing who has the floor are great in formal situations or in large groups of people where lots of people might be competing to be the one to speak or negotiating who's going to be the one to speak. Where there's smaller groups of people, we can also signal our interest in taking the floor. We can do that with our voice by kind of going, 'Uh, yeah' or kind of saying, 'That's a great point,' and then waiting for them to speak and then stepping in. We can use the way we look at someone. We can lean forward or use a gesture that we kind of hold in space to show that we are ready to take the floor if someone will give it over to us."
39,16,Gretchen,"I've been talking at a lot of conferences on panels recently. The interesting thing about being on a panel of four or five people is that you're figuring out how to navigate who has the floor because you're trying to present a good experience for the audience and let each of the panellists talk about their area of expertise. You wanna negotiate that 'Who has something to say next?' sort of thing. I've become very attuned to what I call the 'I have something to say about that' body language/gesture combination, which is like you have one hand that's kind of raised a little bit, just below the level of your face with maybe your index figure extended and the other fingers kind of curled. And then your eyebrow's a little bit lifted and your mouth kind of half open. You might say something like, 'Uh...' Of course, I'm doing it, but you can't see it. But you can just picture that, 'Hello, I would like to interject politely, please' gesture set, and facial expressions. That's one way of signalling 'I'd like to talk' in a semi-formal context."
39,17,Lauren,"In those contexts, a really good panel moderator or a really good chair of a meeting will read that and go, 'Okay, we'll hear from this person and then that person,' as a way of managing that. In more informal situations, it really is a matter of everyone in the conversation trying to be as receptive as possible to the needs of each of the speakers."
39,18,Gretchen,"Sometimes, deliberately not doing that and saying, 'I know you have a thing to say, but let me finish this.' You can not let people have the floor as well."
39,19,Lauren,"I think the really interesting thing about conversation analysis is it shows just how much negotiating we do. We might be talking about a topic over here, but so much of our energy about talking around that topic happens around the edge of who has the right to speak, who's gonna finish their turn, who's gonna talk next. There are lots of ways to not give the floor over to someone. We talked a bit about the 'I'm willing to speak now' body language and things you can say. But there are also strategies to stop people from taking their turn: continuing to speak. You can use intonation to stop people talking over the conversation by making your voice go up a little bit at the end so that it makes it clear that you still have something more to say. Then, people will be less likely to interject."
39,20,Gretchen,"See, look! I didn't interject at any point there because I was like, 'Lauren clearly has something to say because she's going up at the end and she doesn't want me to interrupt her.'"
39,21,Lauren,Thank you very much for taking the floor-maintaining cue that I was using.
39,22,Gretchen,"Even things like a filled pause -- when you say something like 'um' or 'uh' or 'well, uh, I think, maybe,' that can be a way of saying, 'I'm still searching for the words that I wanna try to get out, but I have words to get out.' It's not just a silent pause where the other person might take it as their turn to talk."
39,23,Lauren,"Also holding your gesture up in the gesture space -- if you go up and make a gesture and you don't put it down, even if you don't say anything. I like to use this when I teach language and gesture. I kind of see how long the students can cope with me having my hands up without saying something before they start looking a bit uncomfortable. You can stretch it out really far. If you have a conversational situation where you don't wanna give someone else the chance to speak for a particular reason, there are lots of strategies that you can use to maintain being the person who's doing the talking."
39,24,Gretchen,"One that I found really interesting is the use of eye gaze in this because if you think about the simple notion of eye gaze, you might assume like, 'Oh, people are talking to each other. They must be looking at each other.' But in actual fact, what often happens is that the person who's listening is more likely to gaze at the person who's talking, but the person who's talking is more likely to gaze away. Then, the talker can use that return of the eye gaze to the listener or to the groups of listeners to signal that they're finished with their turn."
39,25,Lauren,"Listeners can also do things to support the person who is talking. You can nod your head. You can go, 'Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah.' You can kind of give them some vocal feedback. But that gaze is also really important. It's why people find it really stressful if they're the one talking if people are looking at their phones because it indicates that they're not respecting that this person's talking at this point."
39,26,Gretchen,"Right. We should say that there are different sorts of gaze norms. Not everybody is comfortable maintaining eye contact and that can sometimes result in conflict if people have different sets of -- whether they're expecting somebody to be holding their gaze as if they're listening or whether you can say, 'Actually, I'm doodling and that makes it easier for me to listen,' but it's not necessarily part of the same set of norms."
39,27,Lauren,"I'm also a very vocal supporter of people who have the floor. I will do lots of smiling and nodding and hm-ing. That's not the case for everyone. It's also a matter of different audiences, whether that be because of cultural differences or just personal preference differences, respond differently."
39,28,Gretchen,"I try to be that person when I'm a larger audience of that person who's just gonna nod at the speaker, especially if they seem, maybe, they're a little bit nervous or I know it's the first time giving a talk or something. I'm just going, 'I'm just gonna sit here nodding,' because it's always really reassuring to look out at the audience and see someone there nodding every time you make a point."
39,29,Lauren,"Because that's how we've learnt to structure a conversation. Then, suddenly you have a different genre, which is a formal talk, and you're not getting those cues that you're used to from conversation. It can be really confronting. It's really confronting when you have someone who sits there and doesn't really smile or nod. Then, at the end, they're like, 'That talk was...' -- they were clearly engaged. And you're like 'Oi, I have a very conflicting set of cues from you right now.'"
39,30,Gretchen,"I was giving a talk a number of years ago. I had a person sitting in the back row at some point just put their head on their palm, like face down, like kind of facepalm, during the talk. I was like, 'Oh, no! What have I just said?' It turned out it was fine. But it definitely freaked me out."
39,31,Lauren,Just a long day of talks from this poor person.
39,32,Gretchen,Yeah. One of the things that I think is really interesting when it comes to conversation is how people structure the amount of silence and the amount of overlap that happens in between conversational turns -- how you structure that passing back and forth of the floor to one another.
39,33,Lauren,"We've talked about different strategies people can use to keep the floor, to hand it to someone, to be the supportive listener who's letting them keep the floor or to take it, but they happen at different paces and in different ways in different conversations."
39,34,Gretchen,"Have you ever been in a conversation where you felt like you either had a hard time getting the floor because the other person was just talking so much you couldn't get a word in edgewise, or you're stuck with the floor because the other person just wouldn't talk at all and you're carrying both ends of the conversation?"
39,35,Lauren,"I've definitely been involved in conversations with you where I'm pretty sure other people would have a hard time getting a word in if they weren't particularly assertive about it. We're both very good at talking. As soon as you give over the floor, I'm happy to take it. We often overlap. We owe a great debt of gratitude to our producer, Claire, who makes this sound like a conversation people can listen to sometimes. I definitely know that I have a habit of being very in a conversation, and as soon as someone hands me the floor, I'll take it. And I'll hand it back just as quickly. If they're not in there, I'll probably have something else to say."
39,36,Gretchen,"For me, if I'm excited about what someone's saying, I wanna be anticipating what they're going to say and -- not finishing their sentences in a, like, trying to cut them off sort of way, but in a like, 'I'm showing that I'm following you so closely that I can anticipate what you wanna say because of how much I'm paying attention right now.'"
39,37,Lauren,"There's a part of me that always wants to be the wise, wait for someone to talk, and take a moment's breath, and come back with an incredibly pithy reply that is very efficient. But actually, no, I actually find the cut and thrust of a face-paced, enthusiastic conversation much more satisfying."
39,38,Gretchen,"I think of the Owl character from Winnie-the-Pooh of like, 'Ah, yes. That's very interesting. Let me retreat to my cave and ponder it for a week. And then I'll come back to you with a reply.' I've been in the situation where, even though normally I'm really keen on the cut and thrust of the conversation -- I'm definitely more on that side -- sometimes I have been in conversations, especially if I'm a little bit tired, where someone else will just be talking and I'll be like, 'Yeah, I guess I could say something, but I'm just silent right now. You're just doing all the talking, and I'm sorry about that, but that's what you're doing.'"
39,39,Lauren,"When I'm in Nepal, that is definitely more the pace of conversation. I think it's partly just that it takes having a conversation in a second language to slow me down a little bit. I think also conversation styles in general with the people I talk to tend to be a bit more, 'I'll say my thing. Then, you'll say your thing. And then I'll say my thing.' It's a different pace of conversation."
39,40,Gretchen,"I will say that I grew up in eastern Canada, in Nova Scotia, and I have been very used to having these high-overlap conversations. Then, I moved to Ontario for undergrad and this was the first time that I ever heard people saying the phrase, 'No, you go ahead,' in conversation. I was like, 'What? Why would anyone ever say this?' because, clearly, the thing that people do is just you both just keep trying and then eventually either you give up because you didn't actually think your thing was that important or you eventually get it out. Nobody takes any offence about this because that's just how conversations happen. Why would you ever tell someone, 'No, you go ahead?' You could just be talking at that point. Why would you be spending this time on conversation management phrases? But now I go back to Nova Scotia and I'm like, 'Wow! People talk really fast.'"
39,41,Lauren,"In different contexts you have people who are very involved in the conversation and get right in there. Then, as a spectrum of individual preferences or larger cultural preferences at the other end, you have people that are very considerate of the other person's right to be the person who has the floor and is taking their turn."
39,42,Gretchen,"Yeah. This was why it was really satisfying for me to read Deborah Tannen because she has several books which have been very popular pop linguistics books about conversation. One of the distinctions that Deborah Tannen makes is between high-involvement conversational styles and high-considerateness conversational styles. When I read this it was like, 'Oh! Here's this thing that I've been doing, that I've noticed in different types of conversation where you have some kinds of conversation where you have this cut and thrust, and this back and forth, and this high level of overlap.' I think it's probably not a coincidence, Lauren, that we became friends because we both have this type of conversational style, so we don't feel like we're interrupting each other. I've noticed that I tend to be friends with more people that have high-involvement. I'm sorry, high-considerateness people, I'm sure you're all lovely, but it just doesn't always click as much."
39,43,Lauren,I think there's something about someone who you click with is in some way a factor of how you interact.
39,44,Gretchen,"I noticed that I tend to be friends with other people who also talk quickly or other people who also have this high level of involvement in conversation. The thing that I like about the distinction that Tannen makes here is that 'involvement' and 'considerateness' both sound really positive. They both sound like really nice things to be. It's not like the 'fast talkers' and the 'slow talkers,' which sounds sound of pejorative for both groups to be honest. Both traits that are really positive as long as you understand that's what's going on."
39,45,Lauren,"I think it's worth remembering not only are these traits a scale and that, as an individual, you can move up and down them depending on who you're talking to and the context that you're in, but also -- and we talked about this a little bit in our Episode 23 about nothing and how silence can be meaningful in conversation -- the differences that we're talking about here are millisecond differences. But we're so sensitively attuned to when we can take the floor, or when someone else wants to interject, that these differences are really small and there's not a lot of difference between individuals. But overall, we're very sensitive to it."
39,46,Gretchen,"They're so tiny. The example that Deborah Tannen has is she recorded some of her friends at a Thanksgiving dinner. Some of them were New Yorkers and some of them were Californians. She found that the New Yorkers were move high-involvement. The Californians were more high-considerateness. That's within even the same country. You have two different coasts with two different sets of norms. You can build out that continuum even more. I said I've noticed it in Canada. If you think of it in terms of particular countries or particular nationalities, something like maybe Italians or Spanish speakers are gonna be more high-involvement. Whereas, something like, I think, Finns was Deborah Tannen's example. In Finland, they're very high-considerateness. They have a lot of silences between statements. But even that, it's still milliseconds."
39,47,Lauren,We learn these things really early. I am raising what is probably gonna be a relatively high-involvement child because I'm teaching her the type of turn taking that I find acceptable.
39,48,Gretchen,The thing that I also found really interesting about Tannen's research is that she also gives you a set of tips for what to do if you find yourself in a conversation with someone who is at a different point than you from the scale.
39,49,Lauren,This is a delightful applied use of conversation analysis.
39,50,Gretchen,It's so useful! I tell this to people at parties because a) I'm that kind of person and b) it is really one of the most 'Here's how linguistics can make your life better' examples that I have ever encountered. I think this is why people like her books so much.
39,51,Lauren,"So, as a high-involvement person, if I'm gonna have a conversation with someone who has a really high-considerateness threshold, what should I do?"
39,52,Gretchen,"Right. As a high-involvement person, something we may encounter more often is that you're in a conversation with somebody and the other person is just not talking. And you're like, 'Oh, my god. I did not sign up to give a monologue, here. Why is this person not keeping up their end of the conversation? Are they bored? Are they unengaged with me? I have to do all the work myself.' The temptation when that happens is to kind of go into monologue mode of, like, 'I guess I'm just doing all this work myself. I didn't sign up for this, but I guess I'm just giving a monologue now because this person just won't talk.' Tannen points out the temptation is to dig in deeper into the thing you're already doing. What's actually probably happening is that this person is waiting for a pause that's long enough that they can interject, and they don't feel like they've gotten one yet."
39,53,Lauren,"This is why I find, sometimes, having coffee as an actual activity is quite useful because even the most high-involvement person has to stop for a few milliseconds to have a drink."
39,54,Gretchen,"Sometimes, I do this very explicitly if I'm having lunch or something with someone. I notice that I've been doing a lot of talking and so their food is almost all eaten and my food is not eaten, and I'll be like, 'I'm gonna eat my food now. You should talk to me.'"
39,55,Lauren,That should be a quantitative analysis -- counting how much food is left for each person at different points in the conversation.
39,56,Gretchen,"It's like, 'I still have three quarters of a sandwich here and you have barely any sandwich left, so it's your turn to do the talking, and I'm gonna eat my sandwich now.' It's great because a) I get a sandwich and b) I also don't have to do the whole side of the conversation, and the other person doesn't feel like I'm monopolizing the conversation as much."
39,57,Lauren,"So, what if I'm a high-considerateness person, or I'm in a conversation where I feel like that's my interactional style, and I'm being bombarded by a high-involvement person?"
39,58,Gretchen,"Yeah. Even though I would consider myself fairly high-involvement, sometimes I've been in the flip side of that where you have somebody who's doing all the talking and not letting you get a word in edgewise. The temptation, if you're more on the considerateness end in a given conversation, is to say, 'Okay, well, I guess I'm just not gonna get a word in edgewise. I'm gonna just sit back here because this person seems totally content to just do all the talking. I'm just gonna give up.' Like how just doing all the talking yourself, if you're on that end, is also a kind of digging yourself in deeper rather than trying a different strategy, the person who seems to be giving a monologue actually really wants to be interrupted -- or what, for you, will feel like interrupting. I had a friend that I knew a number of years ago who was part of a larger friend group. This person was kind of known in our friend group for being a person that was prone to monologue or would get into conversational monologue. Because I'm pretty high-involvement, I was often able to interrupt this person and then other people could get in after me. We had this meta conversation among our friends that was like, 'Do you guys mind that I keep trying to interrupt this person's monologue?' And the other people were like, 'No, no, no! This is great. Because once you've interrupted her, then I can get in.'"
39,59,Lauren,"Not because she didn't want to be interrupted, just that you were the person who could do that."
39,60,Gretchen,"No, I just had enough tolerance for overlap that I was willing to do something that, to the rest of this group -- and this was early on when I had moved to Ontario. So, this was when I was in undergrad and I was still used to this really high-involvement style. Most of the people around me also had this high-considerateness style, except for someone else who also wasn't from the same area who also had this really high-involvement style. So, I was able to get in this person's very high-involvement style, and then all of these considerateness people were like, 'Oh, yeah. Okay. Now, I can talk because there's been a long enough gap that I feel like I can get a word in edgewise.' It's really tempting to keep doing the strategy that you're most comfortable with, but, in fact, it can be useful to do the thing that seems rude to you -- whether that's it seems really rude to leave silences or it seems really rude to interrupt. That can sometimes help break a conversation out of its fail state where one person is doing all the talking and the other person isn't talking at all."
39,61,Lauren,Thinking about cues to give over the floor or to take the floor and then using those to do the thing that probably feels like the thing you don't want to be doing can make it a bit easier.
39,62,Gretchen,"Yeah. Reading this on paper -- and this is why I tell people, 'Hey, there's research about this because it feels really rude to do the thing that doesn't come naturally.' It feels rude to me to leave too many silences because then it's like I'm not interested. But if I know that the other person is waiting for silences or if I know the other person is waiting for interruptions, even though an interruption might feel rude, it can be cooperative in the right set of circumstances. It gives you permission to help make the conversation better."
39,63,Lauren,"Of course, remember you have other linguistic tools in your conversational toolkit for doing this. So, taking a moment to ask someone questions if you feel like you need to give them a chance to take the floor can be one way of very actively handing the floor over to someone. A question is a big 'Here is the floor and I am handing it to you' strategy."
39,64,Gretchen,"This was something that I also found really interesting about Tannen's research because she talks about how some conversation styles -- and I'm not sure if it completely correlates with the high-involvement versus high-considerateness thing -- but she talks about how some conversational styles use questions and other conversational styles use one person's anecdote as a springboard for me to give my version of that anecdote. And the other person uses that as a springboard for their anecdote. Then, I use it as a springboard for my anecdote. And you go back and forth with 'You've shared something, so that's my cue to share something,' even without questions. Whereas, for me in a conversational style, I actually find questions fairly rude."
39,65,Lauren,Because it's assuming that I have the right to ask you about a part of your life that you may not feel like you wanna share with me.
39,66,Gretchen,"Yeah, exactly. Like, not the 'How are you' question. That's fine. But if someone's like, 'What do you think about this?' or --"
39,67,Lauren,I may or may not be willing to disclose that information.
39,68,Gretchen,That's confidential. My name? You're not allowed to have it.
39,69,Lauren,"I guess I'm the same. I won't ask people directly if they have kids, but I might say a story about my little kid and then that's an invitation to them to talk about if they have kids or not if they want."
39,70,Gretchen,"Yeah, exactly. I'm not gonna ask someone point blank, 'Do you have kids?' Or if they mention a dog, I might be like, 'Oh, your dog! How old is your dog?' or something like that. But I'm not gonna say, 'Do you have any pets?' That just feels weird to me. But, in the inverse, it can also feel weird if you're used to a conversational style that doesn't have direct questions, if someone's just doing what Tannen calls this 'mutual paired disclosure' -- so you tell a story, I tell a related story, you tell a story, I tell a related story. If someone's just doing that style and you're waiting to be asked a direct question, you could be like, 'Wow, this person's only talking about their life. Don't they care about mine?' I've had to get used to saying, 'Well, if someone asks me a direct question, at least I can assume that they won't consider it rude for me to ask them the same question back,' which is about where I'm at. I'm still not really starting with questions, but at least I'll reciprocate questions and hopefully people don't find that rude."
39,71,Lauren,You're doing some in-conversation real-time conversation analysis to figure out how best to proceed with the conversation.
39,72,Gretchen,"Absolutely. That is exactly what I'm doing. Because linguists gotta ling. You can't take the linguist out of the conversation. Have you done any official conversation analysis, Lauren, speaking of direct questions?"
39,73,Lauren,"I've done a lot of recording conversations and looking at how people use language in them. But it's worth saying that conversation analysis is a really specific approach. The detail in the transcription is meticulous compared to, say, the transcripts that we create for the show. When we create a transcript for the show, we've already had Claire do wonderful audio editing and we've already really structured the conversation to be as clear as possible. She takes out all of the ums and uhs and a lot of those pauses and a lot of those overlaps that make it hard for people to listen. And then when Sarah does our transcripts, she cleans it up even more. We do this because we're not trying to do conversation analysis on the transcripts. We just want something that people can have a pleasant experience reading. That's very different to a conversation analysis transcript where you're recording every single pause. You're really making clear where those overlaps are. All of the false starts, all of the laughter, this all indicates how people are building the flow of conversation."
39,74,Gretchen,"It can be really weird to look at a transcript of a conversation because you're used to hearing a conversation or directly experiencing a conversation in its natural environment. Then, seeing that written down, especially with all of the annotations, it doesn't look like a play script. It doesn't look like a conversation in a novel. Because we don't actually talk the way people talk in novels or in plays. We do have these overlaps. And we do have these sort of starting to say one thing and then ending up somewhere else, and misspeaking a little bit and then repairing it, and we don't even notice it when we're having it in real time. Then, you see it on the page and you're like, 'What is this mess?'"
39,75,Lauren,"In some ways, we can only really do this level of conversation analysis -- and it's not surprising it only really started in the '70s, '80s, '90s as it's built up with affordable audio recording and now video recording."
39,76,Gretchen,That's true.
39,77,Lauren,"Because conversation analysis requires this revisiting, and transcribing, and more detail, and more detail. Conversation is so fleeting. It's so hard to bring people back to it and even accurately recall conversation. We do a lot of editing in our head. I don't think it's surprising that conversation analysis is really closely tied with the evolution of technology."
39,78,Gretchen,"Which also makes it interesting to think about conversation in the computer context. Because, of course, you also have chat as a format. One of the things that I found really interesting when I was researching my book, which perhaps you've heard of -- we've been talking about it a lot on other episodes of this podcast -- one of the things that I was interested in looking at when I was researching Because Internet was how the chat format had evolved. Because some of the very earliest formats of chat actually transmitted people's messages character by character -- letter by letter, space by space, punctuation mark by punctuation mark. You could see it in excruciating detail as someone was typing. Then, it seems like it would be a technological regression to say, 'Actually, we're just gonna send it one message at a time rather than every single letter.' It turns out this seems to be better for controlling the floor and taking turns in between stages of the conversation because it's not quite as real time but it is more like a dialogue that a conversation actually happens in."
39,79,Lauren,I hadn't ever really thought of that before. It would be very distracting to me to compose a message if I saw your message being composed at the same time.
39,80,Gretchen,Do you remember those old school PowerPoint animations where they'd drop in one letter a time in the title? It would just be really painful to watch.
39,81,Lauren,Yeah.
39,82,Gretchen,"I think that's what real-time chat would be like if it was character by character. This technology has existed since the '70s. There are conversations in the '70s that are character by character. Now, we don't do it anymore. You also get platforms -- so, like Google Docs -- where if you're collaborating on the document itself, you see other people's messages character by character. But if you wanna chat about what's in the document, you go back to a turn-based thing where you either use the comments, or you use the chat side bar, or sometimes people will each go on a new line and they'll talk that way. You have to do stuff to make the turns more evident which, again, seems like it should be a regression until you think about conversation as a thing that's not just composed of individual sounds or individual signs, but actually of turns."
39,83,Lauren,"Whether it's a conversation with someone who still doesn't even have words, or a conversation across a great distance using computer chat, I really love that, in many ways, conversation really is a central feature of language, an essential feature of something we should be analysing when it comes to language. Because we talk about language being a really human thing, but I think in many ways, conversation is what makes language a fun and delightful human thing. [Music]"

39,87,Gretchen,Stay lingthusiastic! [Music]
40,1,Lauren,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics! I'm Lauren Gawne."
40,2,Gretchen,"I'm Gretchen McCulloch. Today, we're getting enthusiastic about artificial intelligence -- teaching computers language -- with special guest Dr Janelle Shane, who runs the blog A.I.weirdness.com and is the author of You Look Like a Thing and I Love You, which is a fun new book about A.I. But first, we have some announcements."
40,3,Lauren,"It's a new year and we have new, big, exciting plans for the Lingthusiasm Patreon page. We are introducing a Discord, which is an online chat space, for patrons to share their lingthusiasm with their fellow lingthusiasts."
40,4,Gretchen,"We've heard from a lot of you that you got into linguistics because of Lingthusiasm or it reawakened your memories of how much you like linguistics because you did some courses on it way back when and now you wish you could talk about linguistics more. We're giving you a space where you can talk about linguistics, share your interesting linguistics links that you come across, and talk about them in a space with other lingthusiasm fans. We're really excited to see what this community becomes. It's a bit of an experiment, but we think it'll be really fun to do. You can join the Patreon at the tier where you get bonus episodes as well, and you also have a space to talk about those bonus episodes and the regular Lingthusiasm episodes and any other linguistics things you wanna talk about."
40,5,Lauren,"We want to see more Lingthusiasm not just online but also on all kinds of things, which is why we are also sending stickers over the next few months to patrons at the Ling-phabet tier. Patrons who are at that tier for three months or more will get stickers that say, 'Lingthusiast' on them."
40,6,Gretchen,"You can stick that to your laptop, your water bottle, your notebook, anything else in your life. Because the original trial run of stickers that we did with the special offer last year were really popular, we thought we'd provide a way for you to do that around the year.

40,7,Lauren,"You can get other items at our lingthusiasm.com/merch page, but the stickers are an exclusive for our patrons."
40,8,Gretchen,Thanks to everybody who's been a patron so far. We're really excited to see you in the Discord. And we're excited to get to try that out.
40,9,Lauren,"Our last exciting announcement is that our patrons also helped us meet a new funding goal, which means that we now have some additional ling-ministration support."
40,10,Gretchen,"Our fantastic producer Claire, who's been with us since the very beginning, is also going to be taking on some more of the administration for the podcast, so you'll see her around a bit on social media and on Patreon. You can listen to a bonus episode with Claire if you'd like to get to know her better as well."
40,11,Lauren,"Our current bonus is on the future of English and what English might look like in a couple of centuries from now, inspired by Gretchen's New York Times article."

40,13,Gretchen,"Hello, Janelle. Welcome to Lingthusiasm!"
40,14,Janelle,"Hi, it's great to be here."
40,15,Lauren,"Janelle, we are so excited to have you on the show today to talk about how we can make machines do language."
40,16,Gretchen,"I think one of the things that we have in common, definitely one of the reasons I enjoy following your blog and Twitter feed and so on, is that both linguists and your approach to A.I. like poking at systems and seeing where they break."
40,17,Janelle,"Yeah, for sure."
40,18,Gretchen,"In case some people aren't already following you on all of the internets, I wanna give people an idea of some of the stuff that you have tried to make break."
40,19,Lauren,"Janelle, in your work, for people who haven't seen it, you take large data sets of particular sets of terms or particular language genres, I guess, and then you feed them into an artificial intelligence, and we'll talk about what that is later, and then it spits out these delightfully whimsical outputs. It takes inspiration from the data set that it's given. I have a sustained history of laughing inappropriately loudly on public transport while reading your blog because the results are always so entertaining. Gretchen, do you have a favourite to share with us so I can chortle inappropriately?"
40,20,Gretchen,"Lauren, I think we should start with ice cream because I know you have a deep and abiding love of ice cream, and Janelle has come up with ice cream flavours."
40,21,Lauren,"Yes! Yes, yes, yes. Janelle, where did the ice cream data come from? Did you have a list of ice cream flavours that someone gave you or...?"
40,22,Janelle,"Yeah. In this case, it was a group of middle-schoolers, actually. There's a school in Austin, Texas, called Kealing Middle School where there is a group of students in the coding classes who decided that -- they saw my blog. They wanted to do it too, and they wanted to generate ice cream flavours."
40,23,Lauren,Aww.
40,24,Gretchen,That's so great!
40,25,Janelle,"The thing is, I had looked at that, and I'm like, 'Oh, this would be cool.' Then, I looked online and I say, 'I need examples of existing ice cream flavours' because the A.I. has to have something to imitate. It doesn't know about ice cream flavours unless I have some to tell it about. They're scattered around. There wasn't any big master list of them. So, I kinda said, 'Oh, well. I guess that's not gonna work.' Then, these middle-schoolers kicked my butt because they went and there was, I dunno, dozens of them -- 50, 60 of them. Like, a lot of them. Each of them went and collected a few from this site or that site. Each one site would only have a few at a time. They had to manually copy and paste to this data set. They just, through the sheer numbers and having the time to do it, they put together this amazing data set of existing ice cream flavours. These middle-schoolers ended up getting about 1600 different ice cream flavours. Whereas, I only managed to get together 200. With the data set that much bigger, it made a huge difference. They started generating pretty amusing flavours."
40,26,Gretchen,"I've got the blogpost up about the ice cream flavours from the middle school students, and some of them are really good. There are these whimsical flavours like 'It's Sunday' and 'Cherry Poet' and 'Brittle Cheesecake' and 'Honey Vanilla Happy.' These seem like kind of reasonable ice cream flavours, right?"
40,27,Lauren,I'd be open to ordering a 'Vanilla Nettle.'
40,28,Gretchen,"'Cherry Cherry Cherry.' If you like cherries, this is the flavour for you. There are also some weirder flavours from this data set like, 'Chocolate Finger' and 'Caramel Book' and --"
40,29,Lauren,'Washing Chocolate.'
40,30,Gretchen,"'Texas Charlie Covered Stunt.' Then, there's this even weirder category, 'Nuts with Mattery,' 'Brown Crunch,' 'Cookies and Green.'"
40,31,Lauren,"Aww, so close, and yet..."
40,32,Gretchen,'Mango Cats.'
40,33,Lauren,"They're weird to us because of the semantics of them -- just to be linguist-y and spoil the moment for a second -- but they still are English words, or they look like something we'd recognise as English words, even though I don't think 'mattery' is a word that I know of. I think it's worth saying artificial intelligence doesn't know what ice cream is, right, it's just using this list of flavours to figure out what kind of patterns could fit into that list."
40,34,Janelle,"Exactly. It's doing it at a very basic level. Like, what kinds of letters tend to come after other letters? What letters are we often finding in combination? Which letters are we never finding in combination? It'll learn frequent words like 'chocolate' or something. It'll learn how to spell that after some false starts during training, but, yeah, without any concept of what chocolate is."
40,35,Gretchen,"If it ends up with something like 'Vervette's Caramel Borfle,' it learned 'caramel' but who 'Vervette' and 'borfle' are, I don't know. That's just randomly combining some letters in ways that are probable as English words."
40,36,Janelle,"Yeah, it's like a kid who learns how to write and immediately starts putting down letters on paper like, 'Is this a word? Is this a word? How do you pronounce this?'"
40,37,Lauren,"Because obviously we train the neural nets that are children's brains by talking to them a lot and giving them more input and taking them to school and doing those kind of things, but a neural net-type artificial intelligence that we're doing this kind of training by giving it lots of data, how does it know if it is generating something that is more or less English? Is there a little thing in the computer saying, 'Good work, Computer'?"
40,38,Janelle,"What it's trying to do, how it knows it's making any progress at all, is its job is to try and predict the next letter or the next combination of letters. Then, it just checks its prediction against some example of real texts that it hasn't seen before that it saved aside to check itself with and said, 'Okay, did I guess close or am I still way off? Am I going to have to change my internal structure so that my guess would've been better and see if, going forward, that's gonna be an improvement?' It's like a trial and error, guess and check."
40,39,Gretchen,"When you look at the different sorts of stages -- because it goes through several different generations, right? It might start out with just 'Here's a bunch of Es because E is really common.' And then the check is like, 'Yeah, but you could do better.'"
40,40,Janelle,"Yeah. It's like guessing lots of Es is more correct than guessing lots of question marks or lots of Qs. Yeah, it has to say, 'Oh, well, maybe I could work in an S from time to time. What do you know? That's slightly more correct,' and proceeds from there."
40,41,Lauren,"So, that's how it learns 'chocolate'? Because it might go in with CH and HC, and every time it goes, 'Is HC right? Is HC right?' And the data set is like, 'Naw, not really.' But when it's got the CH for an ice cream list, it's like, getting lots of positive feedback that that's gonna appear in 'chocolate' and 'chip' and 'cherry.'"
40,42,Janelle,"Yeah, exactly. The process, yeah, it is a lot different from the human child learning language because it's taking place, really, in isolation with no other context. It's as if you are setting somebody in a room with just a few dictionaries or a few encyclopaedias written in a language that they don't understand. It's even harder for the A.I. because it doesn't have a concept of what language even is to start out with. It's all just guessing what comes next in this sequence of arcane symbols."
40,43,Gretchen,"It doesn't have a sense of what's probable in the world either, right?"
40,44,Janelle,Yeah.
40,45,Gretchen,"Because you have some of these flavours like 'Peanut Butter Slime,' which those are all English words, it's just it would make a terrible ice cream because slime and peanut butter and ice cream are not things that go together."
40,46,Janelle,"Yeah, exactly. Or, if I'm getting it to generate Halloween costumes, it'll come up with 'zombie school bus.' It's like, 'Okay, zombie school bus. There's magic school bus. Why is that more likely than zombie school bus?' We know. It doesn't."
40,47,Gretchen,It doesn't have any of that real-world knowledge that you can do -- or like 'Mango Cats.' What does it mean for a cat to be mango? I don't know.
40,48,Lauren,"If an artificial intelligence gained sentience, it's likely it actually wouldn't be a very good linguistics student because it doesn't really understand the concept of sounds. It doesn't seem to have a lot of understanding of the structure of a sentence. We talk in one episode about syntax essentially being this structure that we can hang other bits of sentences off. It has much more of a flat, just looking at the patterns on the surface kind of approach to language."
40,49,Janelle,"Yeah. Keep in mind, too, the amount of computing power it has to work with is so much less than what it takes for sentience or anything near human level. If you're looking at raw computing power, the neural nets we have today are somewhere around the level of an earthworm."
40,50,Gretchen,Maybe an earthworm would like peanut butter slime-flavoured ice cream.
40,51,Janelle,I'll give all my Peanut Butter Slime to the earthworm.
40,52,Lauren,That's very generous of you.
40,53,Gretchen,"This was one of the analogies that I liked in your book, which I enjoyed very much. You Look Like a Thing and I Love You -- the title of this book was named after another neural net, right?"
40,54,Janelle,Mm-hmm. This was a phrase generated from a neutral net that was trying to do pick-up lines.
40,55,Gretchen,I guess that could be a pick-up line.
40,56,Lauren,"We have things like ice cream names, and you've done death metal names, and Halloween costumes, and colours, and these are all three or four words at most. Pick-up lines is moving into more of the sentence/couple of sentences-type of thing. As the amount of words you're trying to generate grows longer, how much more difficult does that make it for the artificial intelligence?"
40,57,Janelle,"It makes it a lot more difficult. When I was generating the ice cream flavours and things, I was deliberately going exclusively for these kinds of problems where it would just have to do a couple words at a time because when it tried to do longer sentences or phrases, it would not make sense. One of the things is that the A.I. I was working with at the time didn't have very much memory at all. So, it would kind of lose track of things that happened a couple of words ago. It wasn't really able to figure out then how to make a sentence work or make phrases work. It was a bit beyond it. The pick-up lines was definitely a case of, 'This is too hard for the A.I.' It struggles, okay, not just the 'How do you make a grammatical phrase?' but also 'How do you do puns? How do you do innuendo?' These were all things that require a lot of background knowledge that this thing just did not have."
40,58,Gretchen,"Another example that you use in the book is with recipes, right? It can figure out that you need to list some ingredients, you need to list some instructions, but then those instructions won't contain the ingredients that were previously mentioned, necessarily, because it doesn't remember that those are what it listed before."
40,59,Janelle,"Yeah, we'll see that. You'll get something that on the surface at first glance looks like a recipe and then, when you actually read more closely, you're like, 'Wait a second. It has no idea what's going on. It's forgotten its ingredients. It's telling me to chop the milk into cubes. Something's going on here.'"
40,60,Lauren,There's something very confident about the way it fakes its ability.
40,61,Janelle,"Yeah. Well, I mean, part of the reason it sounds so confident is that it's copying what humans have written, and humans generally didn't tend to write in the middle of a recipe, 'Uhh, wait a second. I have no idea what's going on.' It learns that is not a phrase that appears in a recipe, so it's going to express any kind of confusion. It's just going to plough ahead with its best guess at what a human would say."
40,62,Gretchen,"This is where, I think, your famous giraffe question comes from."
40,63,Janelle,"Ah, yes. I love this chatbot. It's a chatbot called Visual Chatbot. It's designed to answer questions about an image. You show it an image and then it comes up with a caption, and then you can have this back and forth conversation with the bot about what it sees in the image. You think that premise would be fairly straightforward, but there are weird quirks that arise just because this thing is trying to copy how humans ask and answer questions about images. The training data is important. In this case, the training data is a whole bunch of people hired through Amazon Mechanical Turk to take turns asking and answering questions about images. Then, the chatbot was trained on answers. So, given this kind of image, given what the question is, what would humans tend to answer in this situation? Some weird quirks emerge just from that premise. One of the things that they wanted to make sure to avoid was this thing called priming. People tend to ask questions to which the answer tends to be 'yes.' They found in an early version of this chatbot that they could get 80% accuracy just by answering 'yes' to every single yes-or-no question."
40,64,Gretchen,Uh-oh!
40,65,Janelle,"They ended up having to hide the image from the person who was asking questions, so that helped a little bit. Now, it's about 50/50 if you ask a given question whether it's going to answer yes or no to that. One of the things that they weren't able to correct was this interesting thing with the giraffes. What happens is, if you ask the question, 'How many giraffes do you see?' the chatbot will almost always return a non-zero answer. It can be doing great about an image and, 'Oh, yeah. This is a person on a snowboard. There's snow,' up until the point where you ask, 'And how many giraffes are there?' It will answer, 'Three' or 'Two' or 'Too many to count.'"
40,66,Lauren,"I think it's just worth clarifying, just to really make this clear, this is not a data set in which giraffes appear in every image."
40,67,Janelle,True. Yes. I would love to see that data set -- snowboarding with giraffes.
40,68,Lauren,"'Yeah, there are three giraffes.'"
40,69,Gretchen,"Giraffe snowboarders -- this is possible. Because I know this is an ongoing joke that you have, I tested with an image of the cover of my book which, as I think as everyone knows, contains zero giraffes because it's not about giraffes. Visual chatbot told me that it is a sign that says, 'Unknown, unknown, unknown,' on the side of it which I guess is not the worst for a cover that has text in it. It just can't read the text -- sure. Then, I said, 'How many giraffes?' and Visual Chatbot said, 'Two.'"
40,70,Janelle,"It comes from this thing is copying how humans tend to answer this question. In its examples of humans hired through Amazon Mechanical Turk, the humans had not tended to ask the question, 'How many giraffes are there?' when they didn't know if there were any giraffes."
40,71,Gretchen,"Right. You'd say something like, 'Are there any giraffes?' The person says, 'Yes,' and then you say, 'How many giraffes?'"
40,72,Janelle,"Exactly. If you ask the chatbot, 'Are there any giraffes?' it will answer, 'No,' quite often. But then, if you follow up with the question, 'And how many giraffes do you see?' it'll say, 'Five.'"
40,73,Lauren,"This approach reminds me of, as Gretchen said earlier, as soon as I get my hands on some kind of thing that's doing this back and forth question asking or as soon as I'm let loose on a Google Translate, I think it's a very linguist-brain thing to try and find these points at which the computer can't handle language properly. It's always great when you have an approach that understands how humans actually interact with this data that helps explain why you end up getting these really strange answers and why it's good to have linguists help design artificial intelligence or chatbots and these things because the way humans choose to do language is very different to what we think of as the nice, straightforward application at the end."
40,74,Janelle,"There's so many start-ups that are trying to have some kind of bot that you can interact with in an open-ended manner. Then, they run into trouble. Facebook M is one of these services that was discontinued last year because they thought it was going to be like a digital assistant, lives in your browser, you can ask it to do things like look up show times and stuff. But what people ended up asking for was the weirdest, most complicated things. One guy documented, oh yeah, he asked it if it could arrange for a parrot to visit his office. I mean, you're not gonna prepare for that when you're training one of these chatbots. It turned out to be the chatbot kept needing humans to step in and rescue it. They realised it was going to be too expense because they were always gonna need these humans."
40,75,Lauren,This is a company that has no shortage of resources to throw at a problem like this.
40,76,Gretchen,"I think if you tell people, 'You can interact with this like a human,' they think they can do things like make a request for parrots because humans can understand a request for parrots. Even if I can't personally deliver you a parrot, at least I understand this request. Whereas, a chatbot, if parrots aren't in the training data, then parrots don't exist."
40,77,Janelle,"This is one of the things, too, that makes it hard to tell the difference between humans and computers when you're chatting with them. If you're in a customer service situation, they try to really narrow the context in which you can ask questions and not make it open-ended, especially if they're going to invisibly use bots because they don't want you asking for parrots out of the blue."
40,78,Gretchen,"Right. It's like when you call into a customer service line, it's like, 'Press 1 to talk to this,' 'Press 2 to talk to that,' they really wanna keep your options constrained because then the computer can help you. It's when it's open-ended and people start behaving as if it can do anything that a human can do that you start running into problems."
40,79,Janelle,"Yeah. What you'll get is you'll get these companies that'll build chatbots where it'll start out as an open-end conversation with something that is secretly a bot but it hasn't said it is. But then if it gets confused, it'll invisibly hand control over to a human. That can be problematic because then, if the customer by then is frustrated and thinks they're dealing with a robot, the poor human employee may not have a very pleasant time with that conversation. What I would really love -- what I would love linguists to design for me -- is some kind of very polite, in-context way to ask a question or interact with one of these bots that would reveal whether it is a human or a computer, some kind of shibboleth that is never -- not asking about his favourite Star Wars character, because that's impolite if you're talking to a human employee -- but some phrasing or something that's tricky."
40,80,Gretchen,"That's an interesting question because I think, a lot of times, asking for something that's a little bit non-cooperative, like 'How many giraffes?' out of the blue, is maybe gonna deliver that answer. But it's also gonna be confusing and annoying to a human."
40,81,Janelle,"Exactly. My default has always been, as soon as a human -- because better be polite to a computer than rude to a human sort of thing -- but it would be lovely to be able to tell the difference. Companies should just tell us or have a 'Talk to a human' button or something, but yeah."
40,82,Gretchen,"You're looking for an inverse Turing Test. A Turing Test is this classic test in computer conversation where, if a computer can fool a human into thinking that they're talking to another human, then they've passed the Turing Test. There are ways of passing the Turing Test if you constrain the context enough. Or if you tell people that they're talking to a child or they're talking to somebody who's on some drugs or something like this -- or a philosopher -- then they'll be more likely to believe -- these are the three kinds of people that a robot can be. But if you try to do something that's very practical or that is grounded very much in reality, then people aren't as willing to be generous with the computer's misinterpretations. Janelle, your blog post that you make the neural nets do funny things, they're really funny. And yet, I have a feeling that it's not only that the neural nets are funny, it's also that you're really good at spotting the funny bits and bringing them out to a blog post for us."
40,83,Janelle,"Yeah, there's a lot of human storytelling work that goes on. How is this going to be interesting? Where is the funny thing that it's doing? Sometimes, the ratio is like 100 to 1 of things that aren't very funny that it generates and the one thing that I'm like, 'Oh, yeah. I'm posting that.'"
40,84,Lauren,"Because, I guess, the thing about it being a computer process is that you could just generate infinite numbers of nonsensical ice cream names, but a lot of those are too nonsensical to even be particularly amusing."
40,85,Janelle,"Yeah. It also has a tendency to -- especially if we're dealing with something short-ish and simple-ish like ice cream, then it'll generate something and it says, 'Mint Chocolate Chip,' and I'm like, 'Oh. It just copied that.' It learned that one."
40,86,Lauren,Learnt that one too well.
40,87,Janelle,"Yeah. Because as far as these A.I.s are concerned, exactly copying my examples is a perfect solution to the question I'm asking of it. If it can predict every single word, word for word, in the text file that I gave it, then that is a perfect score. Sometimes, it's almost like a battle for me to try to get it to be just bad enough at the task."
40,88,Gretchen,"Not so bad that it's incoherent, but bad enough that humans can resolve what it's supposed to mean and it's still funny."
40,89,Lauren,One application of this name-generation process you've been doing was when you created a list of craft beer names and a company actually took one of those names to create a beer. Was that a process that you embarked on because you thought this was a good place to experiment with creative naming or how did that come about?
40,90,Janelle,"This was one of the things where I happened to know somebody who was friends with the owner of the brewery, and I thought, 'Well, this would be fun to actually get one of these beers to exist in real life,' because people keep saying that the names A.I.s are generating are pretty good. In the case of craft beer names, there've actually been companies who have taken each other to court over having beer names that were too close to one another. There's this need to maybe show there're ways to still come up with new beer names and we hadn't exhausted all the possibilities yet."
40,91,Lauren,It's really a collaboration between you and the A.I. where you are curating all of the names that it gives you in order to find the ones that have that perfect balance of following the rules you've given it but with a bit of a lateral thinking approach.
40,92,Janelle,"Yeah. Just the right amount of lateral thinking as well, too. Sometimes, it's way off the mark and comes up with, I don't know, 'Farm Fight,' as a name for beer. I'm like, 'Well...'"
40,93,Gretchen,Here are some of the beer names that were on the list like 'Dang River' and 'Binglezard Flack' and 'Toe Deal' and 'Devil's Chard.'
40,94,Lauren,"Some of them I can almost imagine being a craft beer. In the end, it was 'The Fine Stranger' that was bottled and labelled."
40,95,Gretchen,"That's good. I think the examples are very funny, but there's also an important part of making a lot of funny examples, right? It's not just to entertain people, even though it is very entertaining."
40,96,Janelle,"There's people using these practically as their business in coming up with brand names. I did this one beer. There's a whole art to naming brands, and it's not just coming up with the names, but it's also this whole framing of 'Because of the etymology of this and that' or 'Because the computer mashed this together with that.' There's definitely a storytelling element to it as well. When I was going through this process with the beer, I was definitely getting the sense of, 'Oh, yeah. I've got all these great names.' Any -- not any one of these -- but many of them would make great beer names, and the beer would sell well, and the brewery would be happy with it. But, yeah, how do I put it on the marquee, put it on the silver platter and make them actually say, 'Yes. The authority has spoken. This is the name.'"
40,97,Gretchen,"Beyond brand names, there're also lots of other practical applications people are using artificial intelligence for now, whether that's machine translation or self-driving cars or all of these sorts of very practical aspects to things. It's hard to see the inside of a self-driving car, and what that looks like, and how it's making problems for things. Whereas, it's easier to see what happens when you make a bunch of weird ice cream flavours."
40,98,Janelle,"Exactly. That's why I like doing these tests. Some of the biggest applications for A.I. is in doing financial predictions or looking for fraudulent logins and things like that where it, maybe, is comprehensible to somebody who's in that field, but the way that they're making mistakes in that field is not very obvious, not very interesting, if you're not right there in that field working with these kinds of numbers all the time. If it's making a mistake on an ice cream flavour, that is much faster to see, 'Oh, yeah, it's doing pattern matching. Oh, yeah, it doesn't understand what it's doing.' A lot of these same mistakes really do translate over to commercial applications."
40,99,Lauren,"We've talked a little bit about how you have to curate the output because it will just keep spitting out silly ice cream names forever. We've talked a little bit about some of the problems with the types of data that are put into these processes in terms of, you know, if you don't set it up very well and you have people answering questions about giraffes in a way that the A.I. is going to implement weirdly. There are bigger and more serious implications for thinking about the kind of data that we are using to create artificial intelligence processes not just with language but particularly for this topic looking at the kinds of data that people use to build artificial intelligence. You talk about this a bit in your book. Where do you see some of the biggest challenges in creating good A.I.?"
40,100,Janelle,"One of the things is, remember these A.I.s have about the raw computing power of an earthworm and they don't have the context, then, to realise that there are some things that the humans do that they probably shouldn't be copying. Completely unknowingly, they will copy things like racial/gender discrimination and they won't know that that's what they're doing. They won't know that that's a bad thing. They just really can't comprehend it."
40,101,Gretchen,"It's kind of like the chatbot that figures, 'Oh, if I just answer yes to everything, I'll get 80% accuracy,' even though it's not actually useful, communicatively, to just answer yes to everything."
40,102,Janelle,"It's like this is exactly what you have asked for but is not necessarily what you want. When we give it a bunch of human decisions on resume sorting, for example, and we tell it, 'Copy these human decisions,' then these algorithms can look and say, 'Well, this is a very difficult problem, but looks like all of the applicants who've gone to this one college tend not to be hired' and 'Oh, that college is a women's college' and it is implementing the gender discrimination that it's seeing in its training data because it saw this signal, didn't know what it was, only knew that it was helping it copy the humans a little better."
40,103,Gretchen,"Right. If the humans are already having their sets of bias and if I can magnify that bias, like if you have a human that's answering 'yes' 80% and now the A.I.'s answering 'yes' 100% of the time, it doesn't know what it's doing."
40,104,Janelle,"Exactly. Yeah. They are so good about being sneaky about -- you may think that if you set up a resume sorting algorithm saying, 'Well, we're just not gonna tell it what gender any of these applicants are' and it is very good at figuring this out not just through colleges but through if somebody has their extra-curriculars listed and 'women's soccer team' is on there, it will glom onto that. Or even subtleties with word choice and phrasing, it will start using those kinds of trends and use them to copy the humans better."
40,105,Gretchen,"I'm thinking about a different resume study which showed that people -- they had the same sorts of resumes -- people with a white-sounding name versus with a black-sounding name were more likely to get called back for interviews. You can imagine in the A.I. that it actually just learns how to predict based on someone's name. Like, 'Oh, we've hired a lot of people named 'Mike' at this company.' We all know these companies that have a whole bunch of people named 'Mike' and 'Adam' and stuff. 'Maybe we should just only interview the people named 'Mike.''"
40,106,Janelle,"It will absolutely do that sort of thing. You see there's a lot of companies out there that are offering resume screening but knowing what I know about how commonly these A.I.s can pick up on this bias I would not want one of these programs screening resumes for my company, for example. Or I would, at the very least, demand to see the evidence that this thing is not making biased decisions."
40,107,Gretchen,"Right. That's a sort of way of saying, 'Okay, well, if this A.I. still thinks 'Slime' is a good flavour for ice cream, then really how much can we trust it to make a good decision about resumes?'"
40,108,Janelle,I think that's almost the counter-intuitive danger about A.I. in a lot of ways. It's not that it's too smart and it's going to take over the world and it's not gonna obey humans -- no. The problem is that it's not smart enough to realise what we're actually trying to ask it to do.
40,109,Lauren,It keeps obeying us too well in ways that we don't want it to.
40,110,Janelle,"Yeah, if it can. When it comes to language generation, language processing, human language is really, really difficult. So, that particular domain, more than a lot of others, you'll see these A.I.s that are really struggling to get a handle on what the humans are saying."
40,111,Lauren,It's good news that linguists will have jobs for a little bit longer.
40,112,Janelle,Yeah.
40,113,Gretchen,"One of the questions that really came up in my mind when we were thinking about interviewing you was, can the A.I. take my job as the co-host of the podcast, Lingthusiasm? If Lauren and I want to go live on a beach somewhere, can we replace, as co-hosts, a bot-generated Gretchen and Lauren to run this podcast? Lauren, what do you think?"
40,114,Lauren,"We actually put this to Janelle a few years ago, back when we started releasing transcripts for our early episodes. About three years ago, in 2016/2017, we didn't have many episodes, so we didn't have a lot of data to work with, but also it seems like in these last few years, the ability to process larger text has gotten better. Is that the case, Janelle?"
40,115,Janelle,"Yeah, that's definitely the case. The kinds of things I was doing in 2016 -- generating words, short phrases, paint colour names, ice cream flavour names, those sorts of things -- I wouldn't think of tackling entire sentences or, let alone, sentences that follow one another that make sense. But now, just pretty much in the last year, there's been some really big A.I.s that have been trained on millions of pages from the internet. They are much better at generating text. They can generate grammatical sentences most of the time now. Most of the words that they use are real words. They still don't understand what they're saying. I think, yeah, it has gotten better."
40,116,Gretchen,"You can potentially take something that's been trained on, let's say, most of the English pages of the internet and then fine-tune it on a smaller data set to try to push it more in the direction of just, for a random example, Lingthusiasm episodes."
40,117,Janelle,"Yes. If, hypothetically, I had many episodes worth of Lingthusiasm transcripts, I might be able to make a robo-Gretchen and a robo-Lauren."
40,118,Lauren,"Do you know what else has happened in the last couple of years, Gretchen?"
40,119,Gretchen,I think we've produced a lot more episodes of Lingthusiasm.
40,120,Lauren,"Between the main episodes and the bonus episodes, we have 70 transcripts, which is over 800 pages of data. Janelle, would that be enough to have a go at creating a robo-Gretchen and a robo-Lauren?"
40,121,Janelle,There's one way to find out.
40,122,Gretchen,"Oh, boy! Let's do some live neural netting on the podcast."
40,123,Janelle,All right! What could possibly go wrong?
40,124,Gretchen,Okay. Can you walk us through what are you doing right now on your computer?
40,125,Lauren,"Janelle's gonna share her computer with us so that we can see what's happening, but we might get some screen grabs as we go through."
40,126,Gretchen,We may put some links into the show notes if there's stuff that's visual that's hard to see as well.
40,127,Janelle,"What we're looking at right now, this is actually just a browser window in Chrome. What I'm looking at is a thing that is an interface to an A.I. that's being hosted on Google's computers right now. Google is graciously allowing people to use their powerful computers that are pretty specialised for these kinds of calculations. Even though I am working on a fairly ordinary laptop, I'm able to connect to some fairly serious firepower here."
40,128,Lauren,"It's really interesting to get to see under the hood of making an A.I. run. I think we'll give people a bit of a taste of that here, but if you want more details and more of an explanation of how we made 'Robot Lingthusiasm,' we'll make that into a bonus episode."
40,129,Janelle,"So, here we are. I've connected to this A.I. I've downloaded a copy of it. Now, I'm going to upload lingthusiasm.txt. I'm going to upload this file of 2.4MB of you two talking. Let's -- okay. Okay. We've got our first sample out here right now. 'It is already conversations.'"
40,130,Lauren,Except it's just conversation by someone called 'Gina.'
40,131,Gretchen,"Maybe this is the hybrid between the two of us -- our merged alter-ego? Shall we read a few of these lines, Lauren? I think we should each start with 'Gina' as we're reading the lines."
40,132,Lauren,Okay.
40,133,Gretchen,"First line. This is the first of Gina's lines. 'Gina: Yeah, that's why I'm gonna be honest with you.'"
40,134,Lauren,"'Gina: We're not always going to be like, 'Oh, we don't know why we did that.' That's why.'"
40,135,Gretchen,"'Gina: I know. The people who've come to me to ask me are gonna be like, 'Yeah, I didn't know who was getting up and down the stairs and going to a doctor's appointment.'"
40,136,Lauren,"Okay. So, not very Lingthusiasm in content there, but I like where Gina's going."
40,137,Gretchen,"Yeah. I like that it's getting a dialogue thing. We're pleased to announce that, in fact, your Lingthusiasm hosts will be replaced by robots but only for one episode and it will be bonus and it will be very, very funny. You can go to patreon.com/lingthusiasm to listen to the next bonus episode, which will be written by robots and performed by you and me, Lauren."
40,138,Lauren,"To listen to that bonus episode, check out patreon.com/lingthusiasm. You can hear us reading some of our favourite examples. We will also give patrons access to some of those reams of examples so you can find ones that make you chortle as well. It'll have some screenshots from the A.I.-building process for patrons as well. Thank you so much, Janelle, for taking us through the process of actually training a neural net artificial intelligence and showing us some of the pitfalls and some of the challenges and for talking to us today. If people want to read more about how artificial intelligence is making the world weirder and more wonderful, and some of the challenges and limitations, your book is You Look Like a Thing and I Love You. I loved reading it."
40,139,Gretchen,"Yes, I can personally attest that I got my copy the night before my book came out when I was very distracted. It successfully distracted me for several hours while I was waiting for that countdown, midnight, to have that happen. It has lots of fun pictures of weird things that the A.I.s are doing as well. Thanks again for coming on the show."
40,140,Janelle,"Oh, it was my pleasure. This was a lot of fun. I loved listening to your very strange generated conversations. [Music]"

40,144,Janelle,Stay lingthusiastic! [Music]
41,1,Gretchen,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, the podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics! I'm Gretchen McCulloch."
41,2,Lauren,"I'm Lauren Gawne. Today, we're getting enthusiastic about tense and how different languages talk about time. But first, we are very excited to announce the launch of the Lingthusiasm LingComm Grant."
41,3,Gretchen,"Yes. When we started this podcast, we were fortunate to be in a position where we could put some of our own money into the project to get us off the ground until our lovely patrons started coming in."
41,4,Lauren,"Now we're in a position where we want to pay it forward, and we want to help the next generation of awesome pop linguistics projects find their feet. We're giving out a $500 US grant to a project that helps communicate linguistics to a new audience."
41,5,Gretchen,"With your help, if we reach 800 patrons by May 1st, we can give out three of these grants. We're really looking forward to seeing the applications come in. Applications are due June 1st. You can see more details about the LingComm grant and how to apply on our website. We'll link to it from the show notes. It's lingcomm.org -- two Ms in 'comm.'"
41,6,Lauren,"We know that some of you may be really passionate about the idea of there being more linguistics communication projects out in the world but don't have the time or the expertise. If you really want to help support us in the LingComm grants, we've created a new tier at the Patreon called 'Phil-ling-thropist.' For every person who supports us at $50.00 or more at that level, we'll drop the number of patrons that we need to meet the three-grant goal down by 10. You will be as effective at 10 other patrons."
41,7,Gretchen,"Don't feel like you need to do this, but if you're somebody who has a real job and this isn't a lot of money to you, then this is an interesting thing to do with it. We'll also send you a Lingthusiast mug after three months at this tier, so you can share your lingthusiasm that way."
41,8,Lauren,"Of course, patrons at any level will help us meet the 800-patron goal to give out three grants."
41,9,Gretchen,"If you're also excited about showing off that you're a lingthusiast, we also have a new sticker that says, 'Lingthusiast, a person that's enthusiastic about linguistics,' which we've added to the $15.00 level on Patreon. Go check out the Patreon. We have new stuff there!"
41,10,Lauren,"Speaking of the stuff at the Patreon, we now have a Discord server for all our Ling-thusiast and above tiers, which is the first Discord server I've ever been on. I'm learning a lot."
41,11,Gretchen,"It's been really fun to see people join so quickly because there're actually a lot of people who are already joined and are chatting about things like interesting linguistics links that you come across, conlanging, learning languages, linguistics memes -- we even have a channel where you can talk to each other in the International Phonetic Alphabet, which was a fun challenge -- and other interesting linguistics things that you come across around the internet."
41,12,Lauren,"Lots of different channels. All very lingthusiastic -- typing, chat. I feel like it definitely has an old-days-of-the-internet-user-group vibe that makes me really happy."
41,13,Gretchen,It's been really fun to start hanging out there. I think people are really enjoying that. Join us in the Discord!
41,14,Lauren,"Our current bonus for patrons is bonus content from our interview with Janelle Shane in which we walk through creating a Lingthusiasm bot that generates Lingthusiasm transcripts. We walked through that in detail, and then we read some of our favourites."
41,15,Gretchen,"If you would like to hear what Lingthusiasm would sound like if it were written by a neural net who is very enthusiastic but doesn't really know that much about actual linguistics but finds some keywords sometimes, you can check that out. Definitely stay tuned for the part towards the end where we prompt the neural net with both Lingthusiasm and Harry Potter fan fiction. You get the most magical Lingthusiasm episode ever."
41,16,Lauren,This and 35 other bonus episodes at patreon.com/lingthusiasm. [Music]
41,17,Lauren,"Okay, Gretchen, I'm gonna do some real-life sentence elicitation so we can look at some examples of how tense works with time. Are you ready if I give you a bit of a prompt?"
41,18,Gretchen,Sure. Let's go.
41,19,Lauren,Tell me about something that happened yesterday in the past.
41,20,Gretchen,"I'm walking down the street yesterday, and I see this bird, right? This bird starts coming towards me."
41,21,Lauren,"Okay. I am definitely gonna ask you about the rest of that story later, but for now, can I have an example of something that's happening or could be happening right now in the present?"
41,22,Gretchen,"Well, let's pretend that I'm not just literally recording this podcast with you because that's a little bit too meta. Let's say I'm just sitting at home right now, and I'm eating a delicious cake, and you're drinking a cup of tea."
41,23,Lauren,"Mmm. Right. I might need to go get a cup of tea. Before I do that, let's have an example of something that is going to happen later in the future."
41,24,Gretchen,"I'm going to the airport tomorrow, fly out to Rome at 10:00. We arrive the next morning, and then --"
41,25,Lauren,Are you going to Rome tomorrow?
41,26,Gretchen,"No. No, I'm not. It's just the first place that I thought of. I'm not going anywhere."
41,27,Lauren,"But, man, now I want a cup of tea and pizza."
41,28,Gretchen,"One of the things that I think is really interesting about these examples is that because I'm a bit of your confederate in this experiment, shall I say."
41,29,Lauren,Yeah. This is not naturalistic data at all.
41,30,Gretchen,"Because I've been briefed. One of the things that I was able to do is I was able to talk about something that happened yesterday and something that's happening right now and something that is gonna happen tomorrow, but I was actually able to use the same forms of the verb for all of them. Let's do a little rewind."
41,31,Lauren,"Right. In the past, you used the verb --"
41,32,Gretchen,'I'm walking down the street. I see this bird.'
41,33,Lauren,Present.
41,34,Gretchen,'I'm sitting at home. I'm eating a delicious cake.'
41,35,Lauren,Future.
41,36,Gretchen,'I'm going to the airport. We fly out to Rome.'
41,37,Lauren,I think the answer is that the relationship between tense and time is not as straightforward as we might think it is. We don't have a past tense that is always used with past events.
41,38,Gretchen,"Right. Normally, if you're in a Ling 101 class and we're talking about tense -- or you're in a language class and you're talking about tense -- and the definition that everyone gives about tense is, 'Well, it means time.' It kind of does, but it also kind of doesn't. This is the complexity that we're gonna be trying to unravel for the rest of this episode."
41,39,Lauren,"We have something that's happening with grammar. We're gonna call that tense. We have something that is happening with the flow of time that's in the real world -- where there is language being spoken or not -- time is still ticking on. I mean, we've talked about how to conceptualise time in an earlier episode, but just thinking about the flow of time and then tense as a grammatical construct that relates to it but doesn't perfectly map onto it."
41,40,Gretchen,"What I was able to do in this experiment is I was able to use the English present tense to talk about actions in the past, and in the present, and in the future. What's interesting is that -- so English has another tense, which is the past tense, and I can't quite do all three of these things with the past tense."
41,41,Lauren,Give me an example of the future with the past tense.
41,42,Gretchen,"'I sat at home right now' is problematic. That has some tension there. It gets really tricky if I wanna say, 'I went to the airport tomorrow.' That -- hmm, no."
41,43,Lauren,"I definitely don't have that as a valid utterance in this real world, no time travelling sense of how language works."
41,44,Gretchen,"Putting time travel aside, this is not how English works. Many linguists talk about English as having two tenses -- past and non-past. What this means is that the non-past tense is the one that I can use to talk about any time space and the past tense I can only use to talk about the past. That's why I'm able to say, 'I walked down the street yesterday,' but not, 'I sat at home right now' or 'I went to the airport tomorrow' because the past tense is really restricted but the non-past tense can be in any of these times."
41,45,Lauren,"It also speaks to something that I think sometimes people find a bit confronting about studying linguistics, which is that the way that they're taught the idea of grammar in English language classes or in grammar classes is that we have a past, present, and future. But from a linguistic analysis, English is treated as a language with a past and non-past distinction. The non-past includes present and future constructions."
41,46,Gretchen,"And sometimes this weird version of the past that's used for storytelling purposes. Many kinds of past in English you do actually wanna use the past tense, but there's this one very specific storytelling thing where you can use the present -- or more accurately, the non-past -- even in something that happened in the past to make it seem more vivid and more relevant to a particular current time. You'd have a harder time saying something like, 'The Norman conquest of English happens in 1066.' That would be a harder sell for English. You'd really wanna say, 'happened,' there. You could say, I guess, 'William the Conqueror comes across the English Channel, right? And he's got this big ship.' There, you're using the present to make it very vivid."
41,47,Lauren,I feel so much more compelled when you use that present in past.
41,48,Gretchen,"That makes it seem very vernacular, very storytelling-y. I'm doing this casual thing where you're not gonna see that in a traditional history textbook, but you might see it in a fun, vivid history podcast type thing."
41,49,Lauren,"I was kind of surprised when I took an English grammar linguistics subject just how many different grammatical constructions around tense there are in the English because I had this very simple idea that there was a past, present, future -- done, done, done -- and it's like, 'Ah, this is why the Cambridge Grammar of the English Language is such a massive book' because I hadn't really thought about the fact that the tense that you use in that narrative past using the present form is -- the time is in the past but the tense is not just using a past tense."
41,50,Gretchen,"This is why it's useful to have -- why not just call it 'time' if tense just means 'time'? Why not just say 'time'? Well, it's because there's actually this difference in that the tense refers to specifically a thing that is done in the shape of a language can be somewhat independent from what's actually going on in the world that you're referring to, as in the case where you use the present to talk about the past. It doesn't somehow make it the past. What about the future? Because, Lauren, it seems like English, we can definitely talk about the future."
41,51,Lauren,"There are forms that I can talk about like, 'I will go' -- well, I won't go to Rome -- but 'I will go to Rome tomorrow' or 'I'm going to go to Rome tomorrow.' I can do that for 'tomorrow' in a way that I can't do it for 'yesterday.' There's something happening there."
41,52,Gretchen,"The analysis of this in English is that 'will' and 'gonna' are treated like other types of things where you can add these sort of semi-verbs. If I wanted to say, 'I can go to Rome,' 'I might go to Rome,' 'I wanna go to Rome,' 'I have to go to Rome,' 'I will go to Rome,' 'I'm gonna go to Rome' -- all of these are the category of 'modals,' but we're not gonna get into the terminology here -- all of this category of, 'Here's this additional word that you can add that adds this additional information.' Sometimes, that's a time-related piece of information. But sometimes that has to do with desires or possibilities or other types of additional meaning. That's not how English talks about tense. English tense generally is something that's part of the verb itself, whereas this is this additional word that gets added. It's less obligatory in the future because it's a lot more legit to say, 'I fly to Rome tomorrow,' and 'I will fly to Rome tomorrow,' and 'I'm gonna fly to Rome tomorrow.' All of these are pretty good. Whereas, this case of 'I'm walking down the street yesterday' is really this very one limited context. With 'I fly to Rome tomorrow,' there's a lot more places where you can use that. You don't have to do this thing with 'will.' You have these other options like 'gonna' or just using the non-past form of the verb."
41,53,Lauren,There's something about obligatoriness when it comes to tense.
41,54,Gretchen,"It kind of reminds me of -- remember the episode where we talked about evidentiality and how some languages you have to indicate the source of evidence that you have for something and other languages you can indicate the source of evidence, but you don't have to?"
41,55,Lauren,Yeah.
41,56,Gretchen,"There's this similar thing going on with tense where, in some contexts, you have to indicate this piece of time information -- or in some languages -- and in other contexts you don't have to indicate this time information."
41,57,Lauren,"For English, it's a language where evidentiality is completely optional. You can add some words to express a phenomenon. Then tense, especially with the past/present distinction, is obligatory."
41,58,Gretchen,"Mostly obligatory. I think everything is a continuum, right?"
41,59,Lauren,"Yeah. I definitely am always wary of anyone who has discrete and absolute categories for things because every time you're like, 'It's obligatory,' you'll find a context in English like that narrative present where you're like, 'Oh, no! It's broken my brain.' Whereas, if you take a 'Let's just look at what the language is doing and build up our analysis,' it causes a lot less existential anxiety."
41,60,Gretchen,"That's the other thing about looking at what a language is doing is that it's often useful to look at it internally based on whatever this language does in really unambiguous cases where it's tense. That's what we can use as our diagnostic for these more ambiguous cases. If English didn't have past tense either, then maybe we would say that 'will' was a future tense. But because English does this thing with suffixes generally or irregular forms of the verb to be past, then we can say, 'Well, 'will' is clearly doing that's different from that and it seems like it makes more sense if we group 'will' in with 'can' and 'might' and 'should,' rather than grouping 'will' in with the past '-ed' ending."
41,61,Lauren,"I think that's fair enough to start with the examples of what we have that are people are very strongly expressing their reliable feelings about the grammar -- and work up from there. There's a quote that says this really pithily, which is, 'Languages differ essentially in what they must convey and not in what they may convey,' which is from Roman Jakobson in a 1959 book."
41,62,Gretchen,"That's really pithy because it lets us say, 'Well, languages can all talk about time or they can all talk about sources of evidence but that doesn't necessarily mean that they all have tense or they all have evidentiality because those are the grammatical reflexes of those things in the real world.'"
41,63,Lauren,"Just as we talked about English not having grammatical evidentiality, we have languages that don't have grammatical marking of tense. The thing I find interesting about these examples is when we don't have something -- English speakers are like, 'Well, of course we can get by without evidentiality,' and then it's a bit more of a leap for someone who's used to speaking a language with grammatical tense imagining speaking a language without one. But if a language must convey something with tense, that's gonna be very different to being able to talk about time more generally -- without it being part of the grammar."
41,64,Gretchen,"Because even if a language doesn't have specific things that only do tense stuff, they're gonna have words like 'yesterday' or 'tomorrow' or 'in the future' or 'in the past' or something like that. That's still gonna let you convey that. It's similar, again, to doing number on words. We have 'dog' and 'dogs' in English but we could also just have 'one dog' and 'two dog' and 'many dog' and we would still be able to convey that information even though we wouldn't have the specific, additional grammatical thing that's conveying that information."
41,65,Lauren,"Languages like Vietnamese and Thai and Mandarin and Burmese all don't have these grammatically obligatory markers. People will, if they need to in context, use words in much the same way in English we talk about tomorrow or later or whatever. They don't have that same obligatory verb marking."
41,66,Gretchen,"I think that there's a Latin-based prejudice that a lot of -- especially the European tradition of approaching language which is like, 'Well, if it's not a prefix or a suffix, it's not grammar.' That's not what we're saying because you could have a short little word -- Mandarin, for example, has a question particle that you just put in sentences to make them a question. That's a grammatical feature. English doesn't have an obligatory extra word to add to questions just to make them questions. That's a case where you do have something that's obligatorily grammatical. So, it's not saying that there aren't other obligatory grammatical features that you can do even if your language is a bunch of short words rather than fewer, longer words, but it's, 'Is this obligatory?' 'Is this something that you have to add to something?'"
41,67,Lauren,"If we had to say 'now' in English any time we talked about the present, then that's as much a choice of grammar because of its obligatoriness not just because it's something that sticks on the end of a verb."
41,68,Gretchen,"One interesting example that came up for me recently when it came to languages having tense is Scottish Gaelic, which is a language that I studied briefly when I was in middle school and then I've been returning to because they added Scottish Gaelic to Duolingo and, you know, it's a language. Something that's interesting about Scottish Gaelic is that it kind of doesn't really for the most part have a present tense."
41,69,Lauren,"Ah, interesting. So, you can obviously, once you start thinking about each language has a different way of approaching segmenting time up into grammatical tenses, it can be interesting to look across languages as to how they segment them. Vietnamese doesn't segment time up into any specific grammatical tenses. And then a language like Scottish Gaelic has -- it has a future and a past? Is that what happens?"
41,70,Gretchen,"Well, the thing that makes me hedge it a lot and say, 'kind of doesn't really,' is because the only verb that has a present tense form is 'to be.'"
41,71,Lauren,Okay. That's a big one.
41,72,Gretchen,"Right. It's a really important verb and it does a whole lot of stuff. Then, all of the other verbs have future forms and past forms, and then they also have -- and this is where you get a little bit tricky -- they also have forms like the sort of de-verbal noun form. If you have a verb like 'see,' there's no just 'I see.' That's not a thing you can say in Scottish Gaelic. Irish, I think, works differently. So, I'm not talking about Irish. I don't know how Irish works."
41,73,Lauren,"I'm trying really hard to not respond with 'Hm, I see.'"
41,74,Gretchen,"You can say things like, 'I am,' in Gaelic but you can't just say, 'I see.' What you want to say instead if you're talking about the present is 'I am seeing.'"
41,75,Lauren,Because you are using the 'be' verb to do the present heavy lifting.
41,76,Gretchen,"Exactly. You can say, 'I am seeing,' 'I was seeing,' 'I will be seeing,' and this all uses the same form of 'seeing,' which is the noun-y form -- the same one that you could use for something like 'Seeing is great.' Then, you also have separate forms of the verb 'to see,' which mean 'will see' and 'saw.' In the future, you can say, 'I will be seeing' or 'I will see.' And in the past, you can say, 'I saw,' or 'I was seeing.' But in the present, all you have is 'I'm seeing.' There's no just 'I see.'"
41,77,Lauren,It's a bit like the English future in terms of obligatoriness being a slightly squishy concept.
41,78,Gretchen,"Right. Obligatoriness is slightly different, and this is why. It kind of has a present because 'to be' conjugates everywhere in all of the different forms. It's also weird because 'have,' which you might think is also a pretty basic verb, is expressed in Gaelic by saying something is 'at' someone. If I say, 'I have a cat,' I would say something like, 'A cat is at me.' That's how I say 'have.' Again, you can just use 'be' to convey 'have' because it's got this idiomatic construction. This was something that confused me when I was first learning Gaelic in middle school because they only taught us the verb 'to be.' They taught it to us in a whole bunch of tenses and stuff, and they taught us these forms like 'will be seeing' and 'was seeing' and 'am seeing' -- all with the same one form. It was like, 'Guys, I just -- are you gonna teach us any other verbs at some point rather than just this one 'seeing' form? Surely there are more verbs in this language.'"
41,79,Lauren,You were going into it with your English speaker category expectations.
41,80,Gretchen,"Right. On the one hand, being an English speaker gave me an advantage because English also does this in a lot of contexts, right? English often says something like, 'I am seeing' or 'I am eating' or 'I am walking down the street,' rather than 'I walk down the street' or 'I eat' or 'I see.' English does this more than a lot of European languages. Some people have proposed that English does this thing because of influence from Scottish Gaelic, and this link has not been proven, so it is probably not actually true. It would be a fun hypothesis if it was true, but it's not. English does do something similar just not quite as robustly. It was really confusing to me because I was coming from having learned French, where I was given all of these verb forms, and then they were trying to keep it easy for the Gaelic learners and just give us the minimum stuff you need because you really can get very far with only 'to be.'"
41,81,Lauren,"We've seen some languages with a couple of tense distinctions like English or Scots Gaelic. We've seen languages with no tense distinctions. If we go the other way, we can look at languages that have multiple tense distinctions beyond what we see in languages like English. They segment that passage of time up into much smaller categories."
41,82,Gretchen,Yes! I love more tenses.
41,83,Lauren,"Once you see this, you're like, 'We are really underperforming in the tense category department.'"
41,84,Gretchen,"It's always really exciting to see something you don't have and you're like, 'Ooo!'"
41,85,Lauren,"The examples I've always heard of have come from the area of Papua New Guinea, which just has wonderful levels of language diversity."
41,86,Gretchen,"Papua New Guinea has, like, a sixth of the languages in the world, right?"
41,87,Lauren,Yeah.
41,88,Gretchen,"Like, 1000 languages."
41,89,Lauren,"Islands and mountains all do great things for linguistic diversity. Tifal is a language of Papua New Guinea in the Ok family. It has at least six tense distinctions. There is a present tense. Then, there is a 'yesterday' past, a distant past, and a very remote past. Then, going the other way, there is a near future and a distant future."
41,90,Gretchen,Very nice. I like it.
41,91,Lauren,These are all distinct suffixes that are added to the verb to indicate the time relative to now of something that you're talking about.
41,92,Gretchen,"Again, it's one of those things where there are ways of saying this in English but they're not as obligatory or as directly encoded in some sort of obligatory thing. You can always say, 'A long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.' Or sometimes people make this distinction between 'will' and 'gonna.' But you don't have this robust way of distinguishing between these different -- you know, remote past and just simple past."
41,93,Lauren,"If I talk about when I was in school, I'm probably using the distant past rather than the 'yesterday' past. Context does a lot of heavy lifting and we often don't give it enough credit when it comes to things like marking time."
41,94,Gretchen,"Well, yeah, because you might, in some contexts, talk about when I was in school as the recent past because you're contrasting that with something that happened 1000 years ago. Then, in other contexts, you might talk about it as the remote past if you're talking with somebody who graduated last year."
41,95,Lauren,"A language may have particular grammatical categories but sometimes, when you look at how they're used, there're particular conventions. I don't know specifically for Tifal, but it may be that the very remote past is only used for origins and legends and myths and those kind of things. They're not for the time that humanity has been living like they are now. There's multiple things happening here. There's the tense marking -- it's how it fits with actual time. Then, there are also genre conventions like we talked about with the English narrative past that uses the present."
41,96,Gretchen,"Right. Again, even if you have a language where there's a tense that indicates this myth and legend type past, it's like how in English you use 'once upon a time' to signal that something's a fairy tale, but you can also use 'once upon a time' to signal that you're talking about something as if it's a fairy tale. When you say, 'Once upon a time, these two linguists got together and started a podcast,' this doesn't mean that it's a myth, but it's we're talking about Lingthusiasm's origin story as if it were a myth using the myth frame even though, yes, very clearly this happened in a fathomable past where we were actually there and it's not like Cinderella where it's a fairy tale story."
41,97,Lauren,Context and genre are really important when we're thinking about how language is used as well as the abstracted structure of it.
41,98,Gretchen,"I think it's neat to emphasise how these different types of tenses can be subverted so that there's a canonical use and then there's a playful use where you could put something as if it's in that space as well. We talk about tense as 'It's time,' but it's not always, strictly speaking, 'time.' Another thing that comes up a lot when you talk about tense is other relationships that people could have to time. Sometimes, you talk about something as being an ongoing thing, or you talk about something as happening at one discrete point, or you talk about certain attitudes that you have towards whether something is happening or not. Those are generally lumped into different categories like mood and aspect, which can relate to tense but aren't exactly the same thing as tense. I think we have to save those for another episode."
41,99,Lauren,"We've already talked about evidentiality, which is often lumped into those categories. We're talking about tense now. We've still got aspect and modality to look forward to."
41,100,Gretchen,Stay tuned for more things about how we think about time. But this one is just about where it is with respect to the personal timeline.
41,101,Lauren,"Once you start looking at the variation, and you're like, 'Oh, I would like three past tense distinctions.' Another thing that would be very nifty is a grammatical tense that is specifically for the current day. If we want to give it a Latinate category, the hodiernal tense, from Latin for 'today.' It's always so much fancier when you say it in Latin, for real."
41,102,Gretchen,"I know! It's really fun. I always try to not get too bugged down on the terminology, but then sometimes learning that there's actually a fancy terminological word for something is the most delightful part. You can have a hodiernal tense."
41,103,Lauren,"Hodiernal tense is in Mwera, which is a Bantu language of Tanzania. And apparently, Gretchen, the passé composé in French in the 17th Century was possibly used as hodiernal."
41,104,Gretchen,"Oh, that's neat. So, passé composé in French, if you were to literally translate into English, it's like putting 'have' before all of your past verbs. Things like, 'I have written,' 'I have gone,' 'I have seen,' 'I have walked,' except it's used in French as a general past. You would say something like, 'I have walked,' when in English you would say, 'I walked.' There is this other form in French that's equivalent to 'I walked' which is only used in literature now. It's not used in ordinary conversations or even in casual writing. It's one of those cases where something starts out as this restricted, casual, only 'today' or something tense, and then it gets gradually expanded into being used as a default, unmarked past tense. Then, the other one becomes literary."
41,105,Lauren,"Also a good reminder that the role of tenses aren't fixed and static forever. Language is always changing, and evolving, and maybe one day English will have something we can call a definite grammatical future just in the way that French, for a brief period in the 17th Century, may have had hodiernal tense for a while."
41,106,Gretchen,"That is neat. Certain words that start out as being very concrete can achieve this level of grammaticalisation. This is a thing that I really enjoy about grammaticalisation because when words become used grammatically, they often also get shorter. The original form, the concrete one, can't necessarily shorten the same way as the grammatical one. Here's an example -- you can't say, 'I'm gonna the airport.'"
41,107,Lauren,No. That does not sit with me.
41,108,Gretchen,"You can say, 'I'm gonna go to the airport.'"
41,109,Lauren,Yes. That's fine.
41,110,Gretchen,"You think of 'going to' and 'gonna' as being equivalent to each other. They kind of are, but not in the literal sense. If I'm like, 'I'm gonna the airport,' uhhhh... something's broken -- doesn't work. Whereas, you can say, 'I'm gonna go to the airport,' 'I'm gonna fly to Rome,' or something like this, but you can't do it in that bit. The same with 'will,' which starts out meaning something like 'want' or 'wish' before it went to future."
41,111,Lauren,"As in, like, a legal will?"
41,112,Gretchen,Yeah. Exactly.
41,113,Lauren,"Like, a thing that you write. Yeah."
41,114,Gretchen,"But when it refers to the future, it can get shorted into '-ll,' as in 'I'll' or 'you'll' or something like this. But you can't have 'my last'll and testament.'"
41,115,Lauren,"I think my brain got broken by trying to think of -- that does not work, no."
41,116,Gretchen,"No. It just doesn't work. Even though 'will' starts out as meaning 'want' or 'wish,' this '-ll' bit, that can only be used in a tense sort of way. Maybe that's where -- if we develop a future tense in English -- that's where it will develop. That would be interesting because that would be putting future tense on 'I' and 'you' and other pronouns rather than putting it on the verb like we currently do."
41,117,Lauren,"There is definitely cases where we have tense being on things other than the verb in other languages. English wouldn't be the first language to do this. But when you're used to thinking about tense as being a feature of the verb and being marked somewhere very close to the verb, it is definitely -- English wouldn't be the first language to do this. One example of a language that can do this is Kaiadilt, which is an Australian language. If you wanted to have a difference between the sentence, 'I will go to the beach' and 'I went to the beach,' you mark it with a suffix on the noun 'beach.'"
41,118,Gretchen,"So, 'I go to the present beach,' 'I go to the future beach,' 'I go to the former beach'?"
41,119,Lauren,Yes.
41,120,Gretchen,"I mean, I guess you can do this in some restricted contexts in English. You can say, 'My former teacher' or 'the late Mr. So-and-So,' or 'This is an ex-parrot,' and that can refer to something that is no longer whatever the thing is."
41,121,Lauren,These are suffixes that go onto the noun in the way that we think of tense suffixes going onto a verb.
41,122,Gretchen,Right. But these are specifically talking about -- it's not that it's not a beach anymore.
41,123,Lauren,"No. It is still very much an existing, ongoingly, beach."
41,124,Gretchen,"That's interesting. It's just that I'm not there anymore. Okay. Sometimes, we talk about language being constrained by the biological laws of human anatomy. There're certain sounds we can make, there're certain sounds we can't make. There're certain ways we can configure our hands. There're certain ways we can't configure our hands. Sometimes, we talk about language as being constrained by the fact basically all of its speakers of human languages are on this pale blue dot that's revolving around the sun, and we have words for days and years because we all share this as part of the human experience. I think maybe another element of this is talking about languages being constrained by physics. We don't have any natural human languages that have words for the tenses involved in time travel because time travel, so far, is not a thing, so none of the languages have had to develop them. But, in theory, this could happen."
41,125,Lauren,"This would be very difficult to approach as an English speaker because, as we've demonstrated in this episode, one of the ways we test the obligatoriness and the grammaticality of tense as opposed to talking about time is to check people's intuitions because if something's obligatory, then removing it or changing it should change people's intuitions. If you're talking about using past tense, we expect that events that are bounded by the past can't be interacted with in the same way as events that will happen in the future. We use that as part of our intuition building. Can you imagine, Gretchen, how much linguistic theory would be broken if suddenly a whole bunch of sentences could be valid because people could time travel?"
41,126,Gretchen,"Right. So, saying something like, 'I was there tomorrow' or 'I will be there yesterday' -- suddenly, maybe you need to be able to do this because you've time travelled."
41,127,Lauren,"The Cambridge Grammar of English is already big enough, and this is my main argument against time travel."
41,128,Gretchen,"It's already, like, 2000 pages, and if it's time travel, we'd need to double the size of the tense chapter."
41,129,Lauren,It's gonna be a lot of work. It could be fun though.
41,130,Gretchen,I think it could keep linguists employed for a long time figuring out how to do this. [Music]

41,134,Gretchen,Stay lingthusiastic! [Music]
42,1,Lauren,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics! I'm Lauren Gawne."
42,2,Gretchen,"I'm Gretchen McCulloch. Today, we're getting enthusiastic about how there's no such thing as the easiest or hardest language. First, this is a reminder that we're giving out a grant for a linguistics communication project. If you have an idea of something that you want to communicate about linguistics and $500.00 would help you do it, you can go to lingcomm.org -- that's two Ms as in 'communication' -- to find out details about applying for that grant. Applications are due June 1st any time zone in the world."
42,3,Lauren,"We're funding one grant, which is very exciting, but if we make our next patron goal by the end of April, we will be able to give out three LingComm grants instead of one!"
42,4,Gretchen,"Plus, if you join Patreon by the end of April, you can get a sticker or a mug sent to you at higher tiers. There's an extra incentive for you and to also help this grant happen."
42,5,Lauren,"We're also very excited to be able to announce that we're giving out an additional sponsored LingComm grant thanks to a research grant from Claire Bowern, which will be a grant specifically related to minoritised languages and linguistics communication."
42,6,Gretchen,"If you have an idea for a linguistics communication project that's specifically related to minoritised languages, you have extra incentive to apply. The general LingComm grants are open to projects on any aspect of linguistics including minoritised languages. This one is specifically directed to that. We may be giving out up to four grants if we both hit our funding goal and with this new one. It's very exciting times."
42,7,Lauren,"I'm very excited to have more linguistics in my life, Gretchen."
42,8,Gretchen,I'm very excited to see all the cool projects that people come up with. [Music]
42,9,Gretchen,"Do people ever ask you, Lauren, 'As a linguist, what's the easiest language I should be learning?' or 'What's the hardest language I should be learning?'"
42,10,Lauren,"I see this crop up quite a lot with people crunching the numbers on how much effort they're gonna need to invest in learning a language based on its difficulty. It's a really difficult question to unpack. I feel like people just want an answer. They just want you to say, 'Oh, of all the 7,000 languages, it's just this one. That's the answer.' Definitive."
42,11,Gretchen,"I feel like they want, 'This one -- you could learn it in a month. You don't have to put any effort in. Then, you'll be completely fluent and there will be no effort required. It'll be like learning how to boil and egg' or something."
42,12,Lauren,"Instead of a definitive answer from me, they just get, 'Well, this is a fascinating question.'"
42,13,Gretchen,"The answer that I always give is -- it's kind of trite, but it works in a short context -- is that it's like asking where is the furthest away because my answer to that furthest away question is gonna be very different, maybe, from your answer because I'm in Montreal and you're in Melbourne, and we have different starting points."
42,14,Lauren,"Yeah. For what counts as furthest away, for sure."
42,15,Gretchen,"Well, I dunno, Alpha Centauri is pretty far away from both of us. I don't know if the difference between Montreal and Melbourne really stacks up when you start talking about light years. That being said, if we stay on the globe, we're definitely far away from different points. I think the same thing goes for languages. Depending on what you already speak, you can find different languages easier or harder to learn because they're some things you already know, or you take for granted."
42,16,Lauren,"Also, Gretchen, one of the things I love about language is that it operates on all these different levels. A lot of the comparisons that you see among languages are based on their lexical similarity, so how similar the words are in those languages. You could have languages with very different words and have to learn completely new words but the language that you're learning might have features of grammar that are very familiar to you in your language, even if it's from a completely different family. Or it might have --"
42,17,Gretchen,Sounds that are really familiar to you that are easy for you to produce or something because you already know how to make them.
42,18,Lauren,"You could have a language like English and then a language which has words which are technically lexically really similar. You have words that are technically really similar, but the language has undergone a sound change that makes it actually more cognitive effort for you to learn than a language with completely different words."
42,19,Gretchen,"I find it easier to get vocabulary for free going between Romance languages because more of the sound changes that have happened between vocabulary items there have to do with vowels, it feels like. Whereas, going between Germanic languages, the things that have changed between words there tend to be consonants. It feels like the differences are more opaque, even though you can reconstruct similarities in terms of vocabulary for both places."
42,20,Lauren,"When you're just shuffling to a neighbour language, there's the tendency to just assume you can guess your way through the vocabulary, which can sometimes lead to just as many problems communicatively as just requiring yourself to learn new vocabulary for a language."
42,21,Gretchen,"The other thing is, is vocabulary is actually something that adults are really good at learning because we learn new words our entire lives. The average adult learns about one new word a day on average for your entire life. This doesn't stop anywhere. There's no point where you stop learning new words. This goes for the entire lifespan. Adults are really good at assimilating new vocabulary items and being like, 'Oh, here's a new word. Here's another new word. Here's another new word.' Adults have an easier time with this, potentially, than learning new sounds or learning new bits of grammar."
42,22,Lauren,"I can totally believe this. It takes me a really long time to get my head around a grammatical variation and borrowing a new bit of -- always feels like a really conscious effort. Whereas, if I see a new word, like little shiny things, I just immediately appropriate."
42,23,Gretchen,Right! You probably learned a new word pretty regularly. If you pick up a new hobby -- I've started watching The Great Pottery Throw Down and I've been picking up all of this pottery-related vocabulary that I didn't have before.
42,24,Lauren,You must be definitely exceeding a word a day -- like a word an episode in that.
42,25,Gretchen,"I've learned 'slip' and 'throwing' that have these technical meanings and 'raku,' which is this firing technique. Here's all this pottery-related vocabulary that I didn't have a week or two ago. Yeah. Adults are really good at picking up new vocabulary. It's not that much more difficult to pick up new vocabulary in a different language. It's a similar sort of thing. Here are some new words. I can just learn them."
42,26,Lauren,"You know who's really slow at picking up vocabulary? A six-month-old. Like, three months later, still often no words. Would fail a vocabulary test."
42,27,Gretchen,"This is the interesting thing because a lot of times you get this perception, 'Oh, well, kids, they're so good at learning language.' And yet, by a lot of metrics, kids get exposed to language for a whole year before they say one word."
42,28,Lauren,"I know I'm being very unfair on the kids. They're doing a lot of processing and their brain is literally being built as they're being exposed to language but, if we were giving out vocabulary tests --"
42,29,Gretchen,They still have to figure out they have a body and stuff. They have to figure out they have a tongue. They have to figure out they have hands. They have to learn how to do a lot of this stuff.
42,30,Lauren,Adults have so many advantages.
42,31,Gretchen,"Adults can go to a one-hour language class or spend ten minutes on a language learning app, and they come away with a couple words. That's way faster than the kids are doing. This gets us into this bigger question of, when it comes to 'Is a language hard or is it easy?' there's a big difference between kid preferences and adult preferences. The things that adults think are hard, like learning sounds that you're not familiar with, kids are born with the ability -- assuming that they have normal hearing -- they're born with the ability to differentiate between any sound that's relevant for any of the world's languages. They actually lose that ability as they get older. If you wanna try to regain it, you have to do a lot more conscious effort and training to get it back. They have this advantage when it comes to learning sounds even though they're spending all this time and not learning any words. They're learning how to distinguish between sounds."
42,32,Lauren,"We talked in the episode on phonology about the kids who spent the early months of their life in Korea and then, even though they retained no Korean, still those sounds were able to be -- the phonology was being activated when they did studies with them years later and they'd been adopted to countries and spoke English and had not been exposed to Korean anymore. It's just so embedded in those early months of language acquisition."
42,33,Gretchen,"Their brains still light up. I think adults may be able to eventually get some sounds. I know there're some sounds that I've learned how to produce at a bit of an older age, but it can be a lot harder. Another thing that adults often have more difficulty with is learning specific kinds of bits of grammar. Adults are really good at learning, okay, here's another word, here's this word for this grammatical thing, here's a word that makes something into a question. An adult's like, 'Great! I learned the question word. Here's 'ma,'' which is the question particle in Mandarin, which I'm gonna definitely say with the wrong tone because I missed my critical period for tones, 'Here's this question particle. It makes a statement into a question. Great. I've learned this.' This is an easy concept for an adult. Whereas, kids seem to be keener on learning more grammar, more little bits of words that stick onto each other and provide this extra redundancy because the task that kids have to do is different from the task that adults have to do. Adults are already familiar with the concept of what a word is. When you're being introduced to new words in a second language, you're often being introduced to them one at a time. Like, 'Here's the word for 'dog.' Here's the word for 'cat.' Here's the word for 'table.'' The problem that kids have is they don't even have any concept of what a word is at all. They're not super keen on learning words. They have to figure out this different problem which is segmenting the speech stream into meaningful units at all. For kids, it's super helpful to have as much redundancy and repetition and extra things going on in that speech stream. For example, one of the things that second language learners often complain about when learning another language is, 'Why do you have things like agreement in a language?' If the noun is feminine, why does the adjective also have to be feminine? If I say, 'The big table,' why does 'big' and 'table' -- why do they have to have the same ending to agree with each other? Because that's one extra thing for the adult to keep track of."
42,34,Lauren,"Whereas, kids learning in less of a classroom situation are just like, 'Oh, my gosh! Thank goodness! That makes it so much easier for me. I want more agreement. I want more of this dense stuff.'"
42,35,Gretchen,"Kids love this stuff because it helps them figure out what the relevant stuff is going on in the whole stream of speech. We don't actually talk in words. I know that seems very counter-intuitive, right? We talk in just a whole bunch of sounds that just come out and you have to figure out where one word starts and where another word ends. If you have all of these prefixes or suffixes on your words, beginnings and ending bits, then the kid can say, 'Ah! I know this must be the beginning of a new word because it's got a prefix on it' or 'I know this must be the end of a word because it's got a suffix.' If your nouns and your adjectives all end in A or something so that they agree with each other, the kid can be like, 'Ah-ha! I've found the boundaries between these words because I have a bunch of stuff ending in A and it's gonna be easier for me.'"
42,36,Lauren,"I am delighted to know that I get to add another parameter when people are like, 'Which language is the most difficult?' I'll be like, 'Well, we can also factor in whether you're a child or an adult.'"
42,37,Gretchen,"This is the thing. There's this perception of like, 'Oh, why is this language even doing this if it's so difficult?' Well, it's doing it because every language fundamentally has to be learnable by children if you want it to get passed onto another generation. Kids love this stuff. There's a couple interesting studies looking at language structure in relation to social structure. Looking at, especially, differences between languages that are spoken in larger communities where a lot of the speakers don't already know each other and where you have speakers joining the speech community as adults who are learning this language as a second language versus languages that are spoken in smaller communities where people tend to already know each other and where virtually everybody in the speech community learns the language as a child."
42,38,Lauren,"Right. That's the social structures. Then, you combine that with what we've just learned about children preferring more bits of words, more morphology, more complex grammatical stuff, and adults not preferring this as much."
42,39,Gretchen,"You can see where we're going with this, right?"
42,40,Lauren,I feel like this has implications for the relationship between the structure of the language and the cultural context in which it's spoken.
42,41,Gretchen,"There's this study by Gary Lupyan and Rick Dale from 2010 and it's called, 'Language Structure Is Partly Determined by Social Structure,' which is a very concise title. They did an analysis of over 2,000 languages using demographic sources and the World Atlas of Language Structures. They noticed that languages that are spoken in smaller communities where you don't have adult learners -- all the learners are child learners -- tend to have more morphological stuff going on. They've got more prefixes and suffixes and endings on words and inflection things and agreement and all of that sort of stuff that adult learners feel is complicated, but the kids like it."
42,42,Lauren,"For example, we have languages like Murrinhpatha in Australia, which has really rich morphology which, because speakers are more likely to acquire this language as children or be exposed to this language as children, has been more likely to have this rich morphology compared to a language like English or maybe like Mandarin where, because they're large languages that are used by people who speak them as children but people who acquire them as adults and have done for many centuries, this may be some way related to the fact that they are less rich in this grammatical information."
42,43,Gretchen,You can look at this even within Germanic languages. English has more individual words that do grammatical things than it does stuff on bits of words that are attached to each other that do grammatical things even compared to other Germanic languages. The time period when this happened -- English lost a lot of its grammatical inflection -- was when you had a lot of second language learners who were originally speaking Norse or were originally speaking Norman French in the middle ages. You had a lot of people learning English as a second language who were originally speaking Norse or were originally speaking Norman French and that was also around the period when you had a lot of endings in English that were being dropped off. Maybe part of the reason was that the second language speakers didn't like learning all of the endings.
42,44,Lauren,"I guess, as always with these big data crunching studies, you'll always find languages that go against the flow that are like Finnish and very grammatically rich but also still languages of large nations and languages that don't have this complexity of the grammatical system that are spoken in small communities. That's why you look at large samples of multiple thousands of languages and look at the tendencies rather than individual languages."
42,45,Gretchen,"There are things that can stop that too. One of their examples was Russian, which was learned by a lot of second language speakers, but there was this tradition in Russian of teaching the grammar very overtly, so a lot of the prefixes and suffixes that might've been lost otherwise got kept around because they were being taught very explicitly. You get another piece of this puzzle of what makes a language easy or difficult or what makes a language complex or not is that there's another study from 2018, which is called, 'Simpler Grammar, Larger Vocabulary: How Population Size Affects Language.' They find that languages in smaller communities that have a lot of stuff going on with the morphosyntax -- with the prefixes and the suffixes and affixes and stuff like that -- also tend to have smaller vocabularies. Whereas, languages that have less going on with the morphosyntax and are spoken in larger communities, also tend to have larger vocabularies. There may also be some sort of trade off in terms of vocabulary size which, again, might not surprise us because adults are good at learning words."
42,46,Lauren,"I think this also goes to the juggling the different layers of language in this discussion of difficulty is that if a language tends to be very complex in one area, it may be less complex in others to offset that because all languages more or less convey the same amount of information in more or less the same amount of communication. It's not like there's one language where people can say the same thing in 10 seconds that it takes speakers of other languages to say in a whole minute consistently. There might be some ways that some languages are more efficient, but there's no language that is, like, the most efficient on every level."
42,47,Gretchen,"Exactly. There's a lot of trade off that a language makes. Ultimately, a language has to be speakable by humans -- we know that humans have essentially the same sorts of brains -- and that it has to be learnable by child, and adults are often able to learn a language as well, and it has to accomplish the types of things that humans need to do. I think it's also interesting to think, 'Can anything be done about this tendency that adults have' -- okay, well, if adults are good at words, can anything be done about adults having more difficulty with learning new sounds or having more difficulty with learning new grammatical constructions? There's one interesting study about sounds in particular from 2002. They had adults sit down in front of a computer with headphones, and they were played two different sounds that they weren't good at distinguishing between based on their first language -- or based on any languages they already spoke. They had them press a button for which one is which sound. As expected, the adults were really bad at this because it was a sound that they didn't know how to distinguish. An hour later, after doing this tortuous experiment, they were sill bad at it."
42,48,Lauren,Shock. Horror.
42,49,Gretchen,"Then, they had them re-do this experiment, or it was a different group. It was the same task of they had to press a button for which sound it was. But this time, they gave them immediate feedback after every single button press for whether they'd gotten it right or gotten it wrong. Now, within an hour, the adults actually got pretty good. They got up to 80% accuracy rather than 50/50, even in unfamiliar words. In a similar study, they began even pronouncing these sounds better because they just got all this training. I came across this a number of years ago and I was like, 'Gosh darn it, why can't I download an app on my phone that does this for me for any pair of sounds?'"
42,50,Lauren,They should've just packaged up their experiment and started selling it to people as a language learning --
42,51,Gretchen,"Right? Why doesn't this exist? Because if I'm trying to learn this distinction, I just need something that gives me this feedback. If I could invest an hour into doing this, and then now I'm able to hear the difference between a retroflex T and a non-retroflex T, this would be really useful for me. I don't know why this doesn't exist. Somebody get on that. Free app idea. There is hope for adults, maybe, if we can figure out the right tasks for them to really target the specific types of things."
42,52,Lauren,"Like having an app like that that would prompt you and make you feel motivated ties into what is a massive area of literature within language acquisition studies, which is the area of motivation which, obviously, many things I like about linguistics, but one of the things I really like is that you think you're studying language and how it works, and then you get to read a whole bunch about the linguistics and psychology of motivation in language learning because it's a whole field into itself. Obviously, it has a big implication because if you can understand how motivation works in acquiring languages, you can look at what makes a language easier or harder to learn not in terms of the language itself but in terms of how much a person can bring to learning it."
42,53,Gretchen,"This is the basic idea that, like, if I'm really excited to learn French, and I wanna learn it, and I have French friends who I wanna talk to, then I'm gonna be more likely to learn it faster than somebody else who isn't excited to be in a French class or doesn't have any French people they wanna talk to -- isn't excited to do that. This seems like it might be kind of self-fulfilling. If I'm excited to learn a language, I'm gonna go out and find more exposure for it. I'm gonna go find music to listen to in it, or I'm gonna go watch movies in it, because I'm excited about it. But there's other factors beyond that, right?"
42,54,Lauren,"Yeah. One of the distinctions that I really like is Bonny Norton's discussion of the relationship between motivation and investment. Motivation is all those things you talked about in terms of how integrated the language is in my experiences, my attitude towards the learning situation, any anxieties that I have around learning, but also it looks at investment as part of, 'Do I feel like this learning experience is aligning with my identity as a person who wants to learn this language?' not just in terms of the language learning part but as your whole identity. If you are in a classroom situation where the teacher actually draws on other parts of your life and your experience to make that classroom a welcome experience for you as a whole person, that's gonna help you, irrespective of your motivation. You could be the most motivated person in the world to learn -- I think about Latin and why people don't like learning Latin a lot of the time is because they can come thinking that they have all this motivation to learn Latin, and then they get to the classroom, and there's all the stereotypes about you just sit there and have to learn verb conjugations and there's no interest in the classroom in connecting that with anything else you're interested in."
42,55,Gretchen,"Or this idea of like, 'Oh, you need to read about Caesar's wars,' and if you don't care about Caesar's wars, then you're like, 'Well, why am I even doing this?' Is that the idea there?"
42,56,Lauren,Yeah.
42,57,Gretchen,"An interesting case study about this -- I've been playing with languages through Duolingo, as you do these days, and I was looking at Dutch. Because of that, I've started following some Dutch linguists on Twitter, and it was really great because they'd be posting about linguistics, which is obviously a thing that I care about and I find interesting, but in Dutch. I wanted to find out what they were saying because here's this topic that I care about and I can find out stuff that's going on, or I can guess what they're saying because I already know things about linguistics and be like, 'Oh, they're probably talking about this thing because I have this certain background.' Whereas, if I was trying to take the generic advice of, 'Oh, follow some Dutch local news channel that's gonna talk about,' I dunno, 'transportation policy in Amsterdam,' or something, like, I just don't know if I care about transportation policy in Amsterdam the same sort of way."
42,58,Lauren,"You are much less invested, I would say."
42,59,Gretchen,"Right. Much less invested in like, 'Are they gonna put another bike lane in?' than I am in like, 'What's this person saying about linguistics?'"
42,60,Lauren,"You see this with students in classrooms when they're given projects that allow them to bring other skills in alongside just the language learning. If they're allowed to bring other elements of their life or their identity into the language learning experience. I think this goes really to the heart of some really interesting non-classroom-based language learning contexts for second language learners, especially in the minority language and language revitalisation context. In fact, the classroom in itself can be so isolating in terms of people's identity and, therefore, their investment that, for a lot of language learning contexts, classrooms are actually not always helpful."
42,61,Gretchen,"I'm thinking about this in terms of learning languages in the classroom. When I was in high school and I was learning French, and I was learning German, and so of course I was interested in learning all of the grammatical stuff and learning the languages in the grammatical tradition really aligned with how I saw myself. I wanted to learn all of that stuff. But definitely not everybody who learns a language wants to learn it for grammatical reasons or wants to learn it to become a linguist. Some people wanna talk with their grandmother, and the language learning classroom isn't necessarily conducive to that."
42,62,Lauren,This is super relevant to the language revitalisation context. I remember you talked with Ake Nicholas about this.
42,63,Gretchen,"Yeah. I did an interview with Ake Nicholas for Lingthusiasm previously about language learning in language revitalisation contexts. One of the things that she talked about was having students make videos and tell stories about aspects of pop culture that they were already invested in rather than telling them that they had to learn about the traditional stories in order to access the language. She said, 'Let's meet them where they are with the pop culture and have them do that in the language as well, not just' -- you have this double barrier of you need to learn the folklore and you need to learn the language at the same time. Maybe the language can eventually be a gateway to the folklore but, for the moment, you can also use it to talk about globalised pop culture -- Disney movies, or Dumbledore, Harry Potter, or these kinds of things as well. You can use it to talk about multiple domains and let's find a domain that the students are already interested in."
42,64,Lauren,"I really appreciate Ake's commitment to thinking about the students' whole identity as speakers, or heritage speakers of this language, as well as people who consume pop culture."
42,65,Gretchen,It's nice to say that those things don't have to be in contention with each other.
42,66,Lauren,"Even beyond the classroom, you have language learning situations in what are known as either master-apprentice language learning programs or language nests which really focus on communication. They're less focused on overt grammar teaching. It's a space where you have more experienced speakers of the language spending time with people who are trying to learn the language in really supportive, and open, and encouraging ways that really focus on identity-based interactions as well. They're often really grounded in just spending time together."
42,67,Gretchen,"One of the examples that really stuck with me when I was reading Leanne Hinton's book describing the master-apprentice program, which I think is called, 'How to Keep Your Language Alive,' I read it a number of years ago, and she was talking about activities that the mentor and apprentice can do with each other. Sometimes, they're called 'mentor-apprentice.' In the Canadian context, they're not super keen on 'master' as a word, which --"
42,68,Lauren,Fair enough.
42,69,Gretchen,"It's from the idea of like a master shoemaker or something, but I can see why people might not like it as well. You have the mentor doing something like everyday tasks -- doing laundry or chopping wood or cooking something -- and the apprentice is going along with those tasks, and you're talking about the tasks as you're doing them. Partly, it gives you concrete objects so, if you're doing laundry, you can be talking about what the different items of clothing are called or what the different colours are if you have to sort them for the laundry. If you're cooking, you can be talking about the different names of the foods. You have this very concrete setting which the language learning classroom often has this de-contextualised thing of maybe you have pictures of what you're talking about but you don't necessarily have a lot of physical objects to talk about, so you can't recover the meanings of things from contexts as much. You have this context. You can do some of the chores you need to get done, which helps people fit it into their everyday lives as well. When they do training for these programs, sometimes you'll get people from a whole bunch of different languages coming together to do training for the mentor-apprentice programs in general, and they'll often say, 'Let's start out by learning a couple key phrases like, 'What's this?' and 'Give me that,' and 'Pick it up,' or 'Give me this,' or 'Give me that'' -- different types of things that you can use in a lot of different contexts to get your way into the language and to give someone simple instructions -- 'Put this here' or something like that. Then, you can build that up into 'Put the shirt in the washing machine' or something like that. You can build that up into more complicated things, but they learn a few basic phrases that are really useful for actually doing something together. It's an interesting way of fitting language learning into everyday life a little bit more, making it less de-contextualised, because the classroom is not an ideal environment for learning a language. A lot of people spend years in a classroom learning a language only to discover that when they go out on a street somewhere and they try to talk in the language, they don't have the basic vocabulary you need on the street. You don't know how to say, 'Excuse me' or something like that when you're passing someone on the street because you never had to learn that in the classroom, but you do know how to say, 'Can I sharpen my pencil?' which I've never needed to say since I left the classroom. It does give you this artificial vocabulary. If your motivations aren't aligned with the classroom already, you can find it even harder to have motivation to learn a language."
42,70,Lauren,"I always love how my motivation tanks in a week in a classroom where the textbook doesn't align with a thing I feel like I'll ever do. It's just like, 'Well, I'm never gonna go shopping for a suit or go to the opera. Okay. Sure.' Even though a lot of the vocabulary and the grammar is relevant, it doesn't, I guess, align with my identity."
42,71,Gretchen,"When I was learning languages in school, I was always asking the teachers or the professors, 'How do I say 'linguist' in this?' because they'd say, 'What do you wanna be when you grow up?' or something and I'd be like, 'Linguist!' This was always a word that I remember in many different languages that I learned because it was this very important word for me. Whereas, something like, 'Okay, am I gonna become a race car driver?' or something, like, 'No. I don't care about the parts of a car in English. Why do I care about them in another language?' I think there's also, as English speakers, we're often coming into language learning from this classroom-based perspective or this dictionary-based perspective of like, 'Oh, I need to look up all the words for this.' There's also the case of learning languages where you don't necessarily have a language in common already, or you don't necessarily have a dictionary that you can go look things up in, or you don't necessarily have a textbook that you can look things up in. The mentor-apprentice program was one of the things that's designed to work in the circumstances where you don't necessarily follow a curriculum, you follow a life and you start talking about the things in a life. Another case of that is what's called, 'monolingual fieldwork.' When linguists are trying to figure out the grammar of a new language or how a new language works, one type of fieldwork that happens is you have bilingual fieldwork where you have a speaker that already speaks a language you have in common, whether that's English or Spanish or Chinese or Arabic or another one of the big languages in the world. A linguist can learn that in a conventional way and then come in and work with bilingual speakers. In a monolingual context -- and this was especially more common before globalisation was quite as much of a thing -- you have a linguist who's asking somebody about a language without sharing any language in common. There's an interesting demonstration of this on YouTube with the language Hmong where you have a linguist who's -- both people actually do speak English because this was in the US that I saw this demonstration. I was there when the video was recorded. But the linguist decides to speak a different language that the Hmong speaker doesn't have, and the Hmong speaker has been previously instructed like, 'Only speak Hmong,' and you can communicate quite a bit. The linguist had some props, like a stick and a rock and stuff like that. People are generally pretty good at understanding, 'This person's trying to communicate with me. Let me try to do my best effort to communicate back with them.' You can do things like point to the stick or point to the rock, or drop the stick or drop the rock, or break the stick in half, and you can get, 'Okay. The speaker's saying something,' and we're not completely sure exactly what it means, but we can figure out, 'Okay. Let's write this down. Then, if we keep asking' -- so if you get the word for 'stick' or 'the stick' or 'one stick,' you're not quite sure what one it is. Then, you get a word for 'rock' or 'one rock' or 'the rock' or something like that, and then you have, 'I dropped the stick,' 'I dropped the rock,' or it might just mean, 'drop the stick' or 'drop the rock,' you can figure out which part means 'drop' because it's the part that doesn't mean the thing you already identified as 'stick.'"
42,72,Lauren,"The important thing about monolingual field methods is that it is obviously useful in a context where you don't have a language in common but, as a way of introducing yourself to the structure of a new language, it can be good because it can stop translation and accommodation effects happening. If you are working in a language that is a second language for both of you, you may be interpreting what each other are saying through those languages. There's a lot of encouragement to use these field methods to avoid those translation effects. It can be effective in that way."
42,73,Gretchen,"You don't necessarily wanna make assumptions, or you might be -- the language that you have as a common language might not have a lot of structural properties in common with a language that you're interested in, so you may be missing some of the structure if you're just translating it straightforwardly into some other language. It can help avoid those assumptions and it can also get you in the habit of speaking as much of this other language as possible rather than falling back on this language you have in common because you're both more fluent in it together. It can get you in the habit of learning how to speak faster."
42,74,Lauren,"When I was in Nepal, this happened with me a bit because I have Nepali in common with the Yolmo speakers and the Shuba speakers that I work with. We would fall back on that a bit because the great thing about monolingual field methods is that it is a really great way to elicit data and it is really great if -- you get so much more insight and you obviously have a far richer experience if you spend your time talking to people in their first language. But the difficulty there, in terms of being a language documenter and a language learner, is that you can document things and write them down a far quicker rate than your brain can integrate and process them. Even if you have figured out, 'Ah, this is how they do plurals' without ever asking them overtly -- you can be like, 'Ah, this is how plurals get done' -- but then actually embedding that in your spoken competency can lag way behind. There're some things that I have spent hundreds and thousands of words writing about and observing, and I am still really bad at using. This is the disjuncture as a language documenter and a language learner that I experience."
42,75,Gretchen,"One big factor for motivation for language learning is, 'Oh, no! I won't be able to eat if I can't find out some way of conveying to people that I need to eat' or these other types of basic life events that are important. If you keep yourself in this monolingual environment, then you have to figure out how to talk because you have to figure out how to convey, 'I need to eat now' or something like this."
42,76,Lauren,"As someone doing language documentation, my motivations are, 'Right. I have three more weeks and I still have to figure out how relative clauses act in the negative if there's also a conditional there.'"
42,77,Gretchen,"Right. It may be more efficient to be like, 'Okay. Why don't I just present you with some examples in this language that we both speak, and we can get more directly there rather than have to come up the scenario in the language itself.'"
42,78,Lauren,"Yes. But I still love monolingual methods and I still love trying to ground myself in that. If you have watched Arrival, it's very much -- they were trying to broker this kind of monolingual method to an extent there. Disappointingly, there is a blog post on the NASA website that says that they think this face-to-face monolingual fieldwork context type activity will probably be the least likely scenario when we encounter extra-terrestrial life. You just have to keep refining those skills for Earth-bound languages for now."
42,79,Gretchen,"I mean, I dunno, the Arrival movie did a pretty good job of demonstrating how you could use monolingual fieldwork to communicate with aliens. I think NASA should be investing some money into this. The flip side of getting better at language learning skills at a metalevel is also that people who are fluent in a language already can get better at providing comprehensible input for people who are still learning the language. That's a whole additional skill that is part of this meta-skills when it comes to learning a language."
42,80,Lauren,"Certainly. I think regardless of whether a language is considered more difficult to learn or less difficult to learn or has more complex structures in some ways or less complex structures in other ways, I think just even -- I think sometimes we can get so concerned about the difficulty of any language learning that we just forget that any amount of language learning is still good. Anything that fosters any amount of communication is still a completely valuable and enriching experience."
42,81,Gretchen,"There's this really great quote from Kato Lomb's Polyglot: How I Learn Languages that expresses this really well, which says, 'We should learn languages because languages are the only thing worth knowing even poorly. If someone knows how to play the violin only a little, he will find that the painful minutes he causes are not in proportion to the possible joy he gains from his playing. Solely in the world of language is the amateur of value. Well-intentioned sentences full of mistakes can still build bridges between people. Asking in broken Italian which train we are supposed to board at the Venice railway station is far from useless. Indeed, it is better to do that than to remain uncertain and silent and end up back in Budapest rather than in Milan.' I think we can get too hung up about this question of what's easy and what's hard. The effort itself is still really useful even when it is hard. [Music]"

43,1,Gretchen,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics! I'm Gretchen McCulloch. I'm here with Dr Kirby Conrod who's a linguist at the University of Washington. But first, some announcements. The LingComm grant is still open until June 1st. You should apply for that if you have a linguistics communication project that you think will helped by a bit of money and a bit of support. There's more details for that on the website at lingcomm.org. That's 'comm' with two Ms as in 'communication.' We'll link to that in the description as well. [Music]"
43,2,Gretchen,"Hello, Kirby! Welcome to the podcast."
43,3,Kirby,Good morning. Thank you for having me.
43,4,Gretchen,"Thank you so much for coming. I wanna start with the first question that we ask all of our guests which is, how did you get interested in linguistics?"
43,5,Kirby,"I have to preface this by saying that I didn't know I was going to major in linguistics when I went to my undergrad for my four-year college. I got into UC Santa Cruz. It was lower on the list, but I ended up having an amazing time. When I was applying to colleges from high school, I thought I wanted to be an English major. I got to UC Santa Cruz and I realised, 'Oh, my gosh! You guys don't have an English major.' It's just not a program that they have. So, I was like, 'Okay. Well, I'm gonna make my own English major out of spare parts.' What I did was I decided, 'Okay. I'm gonna double-major in literature and linguistics and that will make an English major.' What ended up happening was I essentially made, somehow, the opposite of an English major. It really ended up being the absolute perfect thing for me. What really cemented, like, linguistics is where I was going to stay for sure was my first syntax class in my first year of undergrad. The first day of class my professor, Jim McCloskey, walks into the class and says -- and I'm a freshman. I'm a little baby at this point. He walks into the class and says, 'This is probably the hardest class that this university offers. Please don't take it for a grade.' I have to say it was good advice. It was very hard. Taking it pass/fail meant that I could really focus on what I was learning. This was a Syntax 1 class. Syntax is all about the idea that we can make an equation to put words together to produce only the real sentences of language and not the sentences that don't happen in language. By the end of the quarter, you have a pretty good working model of what sentences can be. It's not complete yet. It's always an ongoing project. The other thing that really drew me to linguistics was that my instructors in undergrad were always really honest about this, and I try to be really honest too, about this is not a solved problem. This happens constantly -- now that I'm teaching Syntax 1 and I'm on the other side of the room -- it happens constantly that students will ask me questions that the answers don't exist yet. It's not that the answers aren't out there. It's that we haven't figured it out yet. This happens all the time. As a student, to me, that was really moving and exciting of feeling like I could contribute something. There's a lot that needs to be contributed. In undergrad, my instructors were very upfront about this of undergrads can and do produce new knowledge in their linguistics classes. Sometimes, undergrads go to conferences, present their work, do original research. It happens because there's just a lot of unexplored space."
43,6,Gretchen,This was something I found really exciting as an undergrad as well that I can be looking at things and no one else has looked at this.
43,7,Kirby,"It's really, really cool. It's one of these things that it gives you goose bumps to be sitting in a class and realise if I have an idea of how to deal with this, then I'm the first person to have this idea. I don't have to just go back into the literature and find So-and-So has already solved this problem. It's a matter of I can solve this problem. That's really, really compelling."
43,8,Gretchen,"You don't have to go through 200 years or 500 years or 1,000 years of intellectual tradition of 'I need to learn this entire history' before I can possibly make any sort of contribution to this area. It's like this is a young field and there's still stuff to do that."
43,9,Kirby,It feels like a math class where math isn't finished being invented.
43,10,Gretchen,"I guess there are still mathematicians who are inventing math, but you have to have a PhD in math before you know what math hasn't been done yet."
43,11,Kirby,"Whereas, very much it is the case that Syntax 1 students will run into new math in terms of syntax. It's really cool and compelling to me."
43,12,Gretchen,"This gets us into the next question which is, how did you get into your current research topic? What was the new thing that you were trying to figure out?"
43,13,Kirby,"I got into my current research topic when I got to grad school. I already knew that I wanted to study syntax, so I was taking syntax classes. In my first year of grad school was the first year that I was out as nonbinary and asking people to call me 'they' and really being a participant in the trans community. Most of my friends were trans. The nonbinary stuff and the grad school in linguistics happened to me at the same time. What this meant was I was sitting in semantics or syntax classes and reading stuff in our textbooks about pronouns that I could just say, 'Well, that's factually wrong. That's descriptively just not what happens.' The reason that I knew this was that I was in this situation where being very newly out as nonbinary and being very newly asking people to use these pronouns, it was the situation where people would use just sort of random pronouns about me. I got the full spread of the three big ones of people would call me 'he' or 'she' or 'they' sort of at random. The other thing is that people would switch pronouns in the middle of the conversation and not necessarily notice it. Or I would constantly be having a conversation where one speaker -- talking about the same person -- one speaker is using one set of pronouns and the other speaker is using the other set of pronouns. None of this is something that can be adequately described in your grad school semantics or syntax textbook. What you're going to see is something like, 'Mary likes himself,' marked as ungrammatical. They're gonna put the star on it and they're gonna say, 'This doesn't happen.' As a trans person and as somebody with ears, I could just factually say that's not true."
43,14,Gretchen,Because people are saying sentences like this all the time.
43,15,Kirby,"People are saying sentences like this all the time. One of the things where I had this perspective that previous linguists had not had. So, I was really pulled to say I want syntax and semantics and sociolinguistics -- I really want us to be able to explain this. Our theory is inadequate if we are throwing out data. This is something where the only time I would see this mentioned would be in footnotes of like, 'Well, that's not really relevant.' I was really pulled to say that is relevant. It's relevant to me every day. I can't get away from it. I came in knowing that I liked syntax first and being pulled towards thinking about gender and pronouns second because it was this apparently over-simplified area that left a lot of questions unanswered for me."
43,16,Gretchen,"You're like, 'Look! I have this data and our current theory doesn't account for that.'"
43,17,Kirby,Exactly. That's the thing that all syntacticians are doing all the time. It's why we get really rowdy when you get a bunch of them in a room is because we all feel that excitement of there's something that you can't explain. You've given me an explanation that doesn't explain everything. I have to make sure that people know about this.
43,18,Gretchen,And this idea that syntax should also be taking into consideration the variation in terms of how people use language and how different groups of people use language and learning from sociolinguistics about addressing these types of things better.
43,19,Kirby,"Yeah. This is something where at my graduate institution where I got my PhD there is a lot of sociolinguistics. There is several sociolinguistic faculty. We have a lab. In my undergrad, we didn't have sociolinguistics as a focus. We didn't have any sociolinguistics faculty. It was very new to me. I was really excited by it because it feels like, yes, here's all the complexity and diversity that my experience as a language user tells me it's out there. Here's a way of thinking about it. As a syntactician, I'm really interested in incorporating the stuff that people are doing socially with language because I think if we're building our model, our algorithm, of what are possible things to do, it is a little bit dishonest to be like, 'Oh, but if you have this certain dialect, that's a different thing and we're just gonna ignore that data.' That feels a little dishonest. Then, the other thing is that it's not the case that anybody speaks just one exact English. Everybody has some level of variation or multi-lectalism or your big box of forms that you have as an option."
43,20,Gretchen,I like to say that people talk differently to your boss than you do to your dog.
43,21,Kirby,"Yeah. If I'm building a model that's supposed to generate all the sentences, I wanna generate all the sentences. That includes ways of thinking about how you talk to your boss or your dog. For pronouns, this is so important because it does apparently seem to have grammatical consequences. It's not just, 'Oh, well, we'll make the syntax part of it a little more vague and underspecified,' because there're syntactic consequences where stuff has to agree with itself. If you use a pronoun in a sentence and then you're gonna use another pronoun later, the rules are different than if you use a name and then use a pronoun later. The example I gave you of 'Mary likes himself' where I said it sort of depends -- I do hear people using pronouns in this way where it doesn't seem to be totally linked to the name itself. A name is something that it really depends on who we're thinking about in our mind. For example, my friend Rory who uses both 'he' and 'they,' you can say, 'Rory likes themself,' and you can say, 'Rory likes himself.' Those are both fine. Neither of them is misgendering them. But if I'm talking about Rory, even if we know that I'm talking about the same person -- especially if we know that I'm talking about the same person -- I can't say, 'He likes themself.'"
43,22,Gretchen,"Right. Because even though this person uses these two different pronouns, that makes it sound like you're referring to two different people in the context of that one sentence."
43,23,Kirby,"If I hold your head down and force you to say, 'It's the same person,' if I -- like in my example -- I'm like, 'Okay. I put the little numbers on it to say I'm really talking about Rory both times,' then you're gonna start saying, 'Well, it's ungrammatical. It's weird to say this.' The rules seem to be really different for matching names and pronouns versus matching pronouns on pronouns, which indicates to me that there is something going on in the grammar itself, in the syntax part of it, and it's not just social knowledge. It really has to be both parts of the puzzle to think about how we can explain what people are doing but also what people don't do."
43,24,Gretchen,"Because even within this 'Oh, you have more options,' that doesn't mean you have all of the possible hypothetical options."
43,25,Kirby,Yeah.
43,26,Gretchen,"But you could do something like switching from one sentence to the next. Is that something people do? Like, 'They like themself and he's a good musician' or something like this."
43,27,Kirby,"Yes. This is something where people do it about cis people -- about not nonbinary people too. This is something where I noticed it in undergrad, actually. A friend of mine was telling us he had gone on a hot date last night. We knew what kind of gender that he was dating. So, it wasn't that we didn't know the likely gender of who he was talking about. But he was telling us the story about this hot date using 'they' the whole time and saying, 'Oh, yeah, they picked me up. They were driving this beautiful car' and stuff like this. Then, a ways into the story he started using 'he' for a while, while talking about getting drinks at the bar of like, 'Oh, he bought me this beautiful cocktail.' At the end of the story, he switched back to 'they' of like, 'I don't know if I'm gonna text them again.'"
43,28,Gretchen,"Interesting. Like, as this person was getting more intimate in the story with this person they're switching to a more, I guess, specific gender in this context. Then, when they're saying, 'Oh, I'm not sure if I'm gonna talk to them again' --"
43,29,Kirby,"This is something where it's not the case that my friend's date uses two sets of pronouns necessarily. The thing about 'they' in particular is that it doesn't tell you anything about the gender. It can imply things, but it can't specifically tell you things. People have the option to use 'they' pretty much all the time. People do use it to give you a little more detail and a little less detail. When they're giving you more detail, sometimes that can give you additional of meaning of like, 'I want you to know this is an important part of the kind of relationship that I'm talking about.' When they give you a little bit less detail, sometimes it's like, 'Well, gender's kind of not relevant for this part. This is the part where I don't think it's important to talk about the specific gender of the person.' It's not that the gender stopped existing. It's just that we have this option of turning the dial up of how much we wanna include. This opportunity to switch and change pronouns in some contexts but not others is something that also brought up a bunch of questions for me as a student in graduate school learning about sociolinguistics because the other thing is that sociolinguists talk about gender, but they talk about it in the very binary way -- or up until a certain point. They're starting to really grapple with this. Reading my Sociolinguistics 1 and 2 papers, there's a lot of, 'Men do this, and women do this.' Or 'Men mostly do this, and women mostly do this.' No mention of nonbinary people. For one thing, they did not include any in the study. For another thing, many of the authors of early sociolinguistics work just didn't really have access to LGBT communities in the 60s and 70s. Or it was really separated from mainstream communities in a way that made it hard to compare directly. Reading these studies as an early student of sociolinguistics and being nonbinary in my first and second year of grad school, saying, 'None of this applies to me. You can't explain anything I do under this model' and really feeling like we have to develop the theory to be able to explain everything that's happening not just the stuff that we don't decide is weird."
43,30,Gretchen,Exactly. What's the point in having a theory if you're saying we're only gonna try to explain some of this data and just ignore a whole bunch that doesn't fit with the theory?
43,31,Kirby,"My motivation for pursuing my work in pronouns, and especially my work with nonbinary and trans pronouns, has been all about answering those questions that came up for me very early in my graduate school and saying I think our way of doing this is not sophisticated enough. I really want to push us further."
43,32,Gretchen,What are some answers or glimmerings towards answers that you've ended up with?
43,33,Kirby,"One of the things that I'm trying to discuss with people is that there're a bunch of other kinds of pronouns in languages besides English, and English has had these in the past, but pronouns that encode this very social information in the way that gender is and still have grammatical consequences. We've just been not using this model to explain what's going on with gender."
43,34,Gretchen,Things like formal versus informal 'you' and these kinds of things?
43,35,Kirby,"Exactly. One of the things that I've come up with is if we think of this existing thing, and there's some really great research in Spanish of Latin America where people will switch between 'tu' and 'usted' and 'voseo' -- 'tu' being the informal 'you,' and 'usted' being a formal 'you,' and 'voseo' is a form of the verb agreement. The verbs will change depending on the forms. There's some great work within the last few years about, yeah, people totally switch in the middle of the conversation and they totally switch in the middle of the conversation as a way of accomplishing certain social goals. This example given by Raymond 2016 where a 911 caller -- he's a tourist. He's speaking Spanish and he's calling and talking to the 911 dispatcher. At the beginning of the conversation, he's trying to say, 'I got scammed at this hotel.' He's very indignant. He's using 'tu' to the dispatcher as a way of interacting of like, 'You are a service person' in the way that you speak down to or, if you're rude, you speak down to people who are providing you a service in certain ways."
43,36,Gretchen,Kind of registering his anger by not being polite.
43,37,Kirby,"Yeah. Later in the conversation, when she's starting to ask for paperwork or receipts or stuff and he's starting to get nervous, he switches to the 'usted' forms because -- so Raymond conceptualises that the reason for this is that he now sees her as a gatekeeper to something that he wants. Now, he has to appease her rather than talk down to her. This is the thing of this all happens with gender too. It's a little bit more abstract because the social relationships that we're talking about are not up or down. You can map them onto hierarchies, but they don't cleanly follow. Thinking about systems that refer to people's gender, and especially systems that encode people's gender directly into the grammar in some way, as more similar to systems that encode formality or honorific marking is a really useful model. It's a really good way of getting away from the rigid binary models that we've looked at before."
43,38,Gretchen,"Because the idea is that honorifics, everyone knows that they change in a given social interaction and people can switch to using a different form of 'you' to address somebody or a different form of even 'I' -- like Japanese has all these different forms of 'I' depending on how polite you wanna be."
43,39,Kirby,"And depending on gender and depending on specific age -- yeah. There's a lot of rich expressive content there. Basically, the idea that comes out of my research is that you can use gender features -- and I'm doing air quotes, 'gender features' -- where you can use pronouns in English but you can also use other parts of speech that are more grammatical to do that work via gender marking."
43,40,Gretchen,What's an example of that?
43,41,Kirby,I'm gonna give you an example from Ru Paul's Drag Race.
43,42,Gretchen,Excellent.
43,43,Kirby,This was very early on in a season. A contestant is not doing well. This is the contestant who is actually eliminated first. Have you watched Ru Paul's Drag Race?
43,44,Gretchen,"I may have seen an episode at some point but I'm not particularly familiar, so you should proceed as though I know nothing."
43,45,Kirby,"One of things you'll notice when you watch the show is that the contestants and the judges mostly use 'she' for the contestants who are all drag queens but not always. It depends on how they feel about a particular queen. What you see with this contestant who's getting eliminated very early in the season, the lead up to her elimination is the usual reality TV of they do confessional shots where they're talking about each other and then the judges are talking shit about contestants in the way that one does on reality TV. The contestant who's going to get eliminated -- I mean, they set this up pretty clearly. They're going to eliminate her at the end of the episode. They talk a lot about how she is struggling with the performance. She's not doing a good job with her costume construction or deciding how to do the performing art of drag. When they're talking about her in her way of not being a good performer, they use 'he.'"
43,46,Gretchen,"Okay. Like, 'You're not performing femininity well, so we're not gonna use this pronoun'?"
43,47,Kirby,"It's not exactly about not performing femininity well because none of them talk about her not being convincing as a drag queen. They're mostly talking about her not being skilled as a drag queen. If you think about it as a type of performing art in the same way that opera or ballet or river dancing are all specific types of performing art that you can be good or bad at -- and the specific thing about drag performance is that if you are good or bad at the specific performing art, you get different pronouns. This contestant was not less feminine than the other drag queens. It's that she was not good at dancing, which this is conceptually a little bit further away from she's not very feminine. That was not the issue. It was not the issue that any of the judges or other contestants were talking about. They were talking about, you know, 'She's not good at dancing,' or 'She's not good at organising her time so she has enough time in the time period to construct a good costume out of garbage,' or whatever the reality TV challenge is -- the thing of there's always a time limit. Part of the thing of succeeding at the time limit is budgeting your time. If you're not good at that, then you're gonna do poorly in the contest."
43,48,Gretchen,That's not really gender.
43,49,Kirby,It's not gender. But using 'he' as a way of layering meaning on top of that -- and they didn't call her 'he' the whole episode. They did it only when they were specifically talking about her poor performance.
43,50,Gretchen,"Interesting. So, it's accomplishing this very specific sub-goal."
43,51,Kirby,"Yes. This is obviously a very locally constrained use of that meaning, but it's very productive -- meaning that people can use those meanings to accomplish a lot of different goals and they can do it without really thinking about it. They can extend the meaning and be very creative with it. This is the thing that really, to me, indicates these are up for meaning making in the same way that 'tu' and 'usted' are up for meaning making which is sometimes 'tu' and 'usted' mean 'I'm older and more senior than you,' but sometimes, they mean 'I need something from you."
43,52,Gretchen,"There's this incredibly complicated flow chart about when to use 'tu' versus 'vous' in French. One of the questions is like, 'Are you feeling lucky, punk?' and if you're feeling lucky, you use 'tu,' and if you're not feeling lucky, you use 'vous.' Sometimes, these decisions are microsocial decisions in a particular instance where you're saying, 'Here's what I'm doing kind of.'"
43,53,Kirby,"Essentially, my contribution here is saying that that flow chart of 'Are you feeling lucky, punk?' and a lot of microsocial decisions applies just as well to gender as it applies to formal pronouns. What this does is it means that we can conceptualise pronouns as more similar cross-linguistically rather than more different. This is a hard project because it doesn't look like pronouns are a natural class -- meaning that they're not made out of the same stuff in every language. Languages generally need pronouns as a way to avoid saying the same name over and over again. What this ends up doing is encoding social information to varying degrees."
43,54,Gretchen,There are lots of languages that don't have gender in pronouns at all.
43,55,Kirby,"The majority of the world's languages have no gender marking on their pronouns. The 'he/she' thing in English, we're in a minority position here."
43,56,Gretchen,"It's this weird artificial thing of Indo-European languages often have gender pronouns, but outside of Europe, very few languages do."
43,57,Kirby,"If you're gonna only compare cousins and then say that you found a fact about all humans, you have a pretty serious confound there in that they are related."
43,58,Gretchen,It turns out all humans have red hair.
43,59,Kirby,Yeah. Because I looked at all the Weasleys and they all have red hair and so all humans have red hair. It's nonsensical to do that kind of comparison and only look at Indo-European languages because they are related. You are going to get some factors that there's no reason to assume that's universal.
43,60,Gretchen,You've done surveys of how English speakers use pronouns has been changing demographically as well -- like by age.
43,61,Kirby,"Yes. When I've been doing these surveys, my biggest survey was looking at 'singular they.' Singular they has been in English for hundreds of years. There's lots of work on this."
43,62,Gretchen,It's in Shakespeare. It's in Chaucer. All of this stuff.
43,63,Kirby,"It's been around. But the kind of singular they that's been around is not the kind that I use as a nonbinary person. The different kinds of singular they are something like, okay, 'Someone forgot their backpack.'"
43,64,Gretchen,You don't know whose backpack it is.
43,65,Kirby,Or 'Each linguist should grab their nametag.'
43,66,Gretchen,"I think the example from Shakespeare is, 'There's not a man I meet but doth salute me as if were their well-acquainted friend.' Here, it's interesting because you have 'man' there, but he's clearly this man in a somewhat generic sense and using the 'they' there rather than, 'There's not a man I meet but does salute me as if I were his well-acquainted friend,' which would be more this specific 'men.'"
43,67,Kirby,"This is interesting because you'll also see sentences like, 'Pregnant women should always be given their parental leave.' We're definitely talking about women, so it's not the case that it's just like, 'Oh, well, Shakespeare thinks that man is the default kind of person.' No. It's also the case that you'll see that kind of generic singular they with 'woman,' but the thing is that we're talking about a set of people. We're talking about a bunch of people in a group and then saying each one does their thing, which is different than talking about a specific person. The new use is something like, 'Kirby forgot their backpack.' I'm a singular they user, meaning that I don't want to be referred to by 'he' or 'she' or anything else. I want to be referred to by 'they.' It is also the case that this can happen whether or not we're talking about someone who prefers that. Using 'they' about a particular person is syntactically different than using 'they' about a group of people that is singular because I'm talking about each one individually. So, 'Each student forgot their backpack' is different than 'Kirby forgot their backpack.' 'Kirby' is a specific person."
43,68,Gretchen,"Right. We can point to that person. 'Each person forgot their backpack' is, if I'm pointing to each person, I have to do a bunch of different pointing."
43,69,Kirby,"Yes. When I did my big survey, what I found was that use of the specific one -- and I tested it by using names. I actually tested it using a bunch of different gendered names and I compared it with other pronouns as well. I did masculine and feminine and gender-neutral names with 'they' -- singular -- and 'he' and 'she' to just see if there's a difference. What I found was that there is a difference, but not for everybody. Older speakers do find it a little bit less natural sounding when I use a name and singular they. It's different than when I use a name and 'he' or 'she.' Younger speakers -- and the age cut off is around 35, basically millennials on down -- younger speakers really don't have a problem with it en masse. Most of them find it fine and they'll rate it as 'This is just a normal sentence.' Obviously, there are individual people who are like, 'No. That sounds weird to me.' But it's not as many. When you chart it all out, it really looks like there's a slope that, as you look at older people, they have a harder time accepting that as part of the grammar or part of their unconscious syntax."
43,70,Gretchen,"Is this a thing that some older people are managing to do it, it depends on how queer friends they have? Or is it like a --"
43,71,Kirby,"The studies on this are very new. To sort of triangulate across my research and some of Lauren Ackerman's and some of Evan Bradley's, it looks like, in general, if you have more nonbinary friends then you're better with singular they. That makes sense. That's Lauren Ackerman's study. In general, if you are trans or nonbinary yourself, you're better with singular they. Binary trans men and women are, in general, better with singular they than cis people in general. Nonbinary people are sort of obviously fine with it."
43,72,Gretchen,"Like, 'Oh, look! I do this myself, so I guess I better practice it a lot' or whatever."
43,73,Kirby,"The other thing that influences it then -- I'm talking about three different studies. We haven't combined forces yet. This is all stuff that's been published within the last two years. It's very, very fresh off the presses."
43,74,Gretchen,This is cutting-edge linguistic research.
43,75,Kirby,"It's extremely cutting edge. Lauren Ackerman's stuff is saying if you have more nonbinary friends, you're better with singular they. I can say, 'Okay. If you're younger and/or trans and/or nonbinary yourself, you're better with singular they.' Evan Bradley has been looking at people's feelings about prescriptivism and feelings about gender ideology. People who have more prescriptive opinions in general are worse with singular they. Also, people who have -- this is what he calls 'benevolent sexism,' which is not 'Oh, I hate women and I'm gonna oppress them' --"
43,76,Gretchen,"It's like, 'I'm gonna hold open the door for all the women.'"
43,77,Kirby,"Yeah. Benevolent sexism is sort of 'I think that people of different sexes have fundamental differences and different needs based on their sex.' If you have that benevolent sexism, you're more likely to be worse at singular they. It's related to this idea that there are binary baseline categories of people."
43,78,Gretchen,"I found for me that acquiring singular they, which I feel like I've done in the past couple years because I know more nonbinary and agender people who use singular they as a pronoun, and at first it took a conscious thought, which is kind of like acquiring a language but in an easier way. I also have to do this conscious thought when I'm speaking French and I'm figuring out am I using 'tu' or 'vous' or am I doing this thing in French. It takes a bit off extra thought, but it doesn't mean that adults can't acquire a language because adults clearly do learn languages. This is not learning an entire language. It's doing something like that, but I think I had to believe that it was worth doing this additional bit of conscious effort in order to actually do it."
43,79,Kirby,"Yes. All the singular they researchers agree that the next step is figuring out, what is the factor that makes it easier for some people to learn it and not for other people? You're not the first person that I've talked to who has said, 'Yeah. I've learned it in the past couple years' or 'I've made an effort to learn it.' I also have people who have said, 'I just kind of picked it up from around me,' but as an adult. Not something where the Zoomers -- the very young Gen Z people -- who are coming into my freshman classes with singular they already. They're acquiring it as children. They don't have to do any work. They already have it. It is the case that some adults seem to be able to acquire it on purpose, and some adults seem to want to acquire it but really can't, or they report significant difficulty. You will get people -- and it doesn't seem to be correlated with age. We need to do studies about this. We haven't done it yet because we all need some resources to be able to do that. But there are people who say, 'I'm really trying to learn singular they, but I mess up often.' Well, people will frequently under-report how much they mess up. You will frequently say -- if you look at somebody who is saying, 'I'm trying to do better but I do make mistakes' -- they'll usually say, 'Yeah. I make one or two mistakes.' Then, you'll actually look at what they've said, and they mess up almost constantly. We don't really know yet what the issue is that makes it easier for some people to learn it."
43,80,Gretchen,"Or something like intimacy? I notice this on the internet especially because you don't have as many cues on the internet. Oftentimes, if you're referring to a commenter above you in a thread and all you know is that the commenter's initials are J.D. or something, you really have no information about this commenter, people will often use 'they' to refer to the previous commenter. Whereas, if somebody knows me, one of the ways that I can tell that they know me is that they're actually using 'she/her' for me as opposed to using the generic 'they' of the comment thread. It maybe signals a kind of intimacy."
43,81,Kirby,"This is something that Leah Velleman has talked about -- I cite her in my dissertation because it's a great idea -- something called 'distal they,' where it's a use of singular they that ends up implying social distance, essentially what you explained of like, 'Well, if they knew me, they would be using a more specific form.' It's in the same way that using someone's name, and especially first name, implies familiarity. It's not necessarily that a first name has some sort of grammatical feature of familiarity. It's just that it implies that you have enough social contact to know their first name, also they're not gonna get mad at you for using it and this sort of thing. That way of using 'they' to mark social distance or social closeness, if you have an option of a more specific pronoun, is something that falls out of how specific and how much information am I giving you about this person's social position. I assume if it were relevant or if you had more information, you would be giving me more information, and if you had less information, that might be why you're using this underspecified, vague form."
43,82,Gretchen,We've talked about people acquiring singular they very consciously and putting in this effort to do that. Did you also study why people are putting in this effort to organise their syntax? People don't do this all the time.
43,83,Kirby,I'm gonna do a rude thing to you. You told me that this is something that you have learned on purpose. You made an effort to learn it. Why did you do that?
43,84,Gretchen,"I mean, it seemed like the polite thing to do -- the 'being a considerate human' thing to do. If someone says, 'Please, call me this,' then I either need to do that or I need to accept this person's not gonna like me anymore."
43,85,Kirby,"That's the motivation. As far as I can tell you, and I haven't yet gotten into the formal research, but it seems like -- people volunteer the information to me pretty frequently -- that the reason somebody would decide to change their grammar on purpose is to avoid doing this thing that's baked into their grammar that ends up being very rude. Misgendering somebody is very rude. It is rude whether you do it to a trans person or a cis person. It just so happens that it happens to trans people a lot more often. You're asking me, why are people acquiring this? And the answer that you had given me yourself is, 'I don't wanna misgender people. It's rude.' It's rude to call somebody by the wrong name. It's rude to just decide to give somebody a name that they don't identify with. I think that a lot of people can say, if you just come up to me and say, 'Hey, I'm gonna call you 'Champ,'' maybe I don't want you to call me 'Champ,' actually. Maybe I don't like to be called 'Champ.' People really don't like that feeling of being called something that doesn't reflect what you think you are. If you know any nonbinary people, you have this motivation to not misgender them. A really sweet story that I can share, when my friend changed their pronouns to 'they,' one of the things that their cis friends did was they decided, 'Okay. We're gonna hang out' -- they all lived together. They were all roommates. 'We're gonna hang out today. We're gonna all clean the house. We're gonna talk about them all day and tell stories about them to practice -- to practice where they don't have to hear us mess up.'"
43,86,Gretchen,"Oh, nice. The friend wasn't there. It was just all of their cis friends saying, 'We're gonna practice.'"
43,87,Kirby,"Yeah. This friend came back -- came over the next week -- and everybody was already perfect at it because they had dedicated an eight-hour day of just doing that and correcting each other and getting the practice out of the way before it's gonna hurt somebody's feelings. That practice phase is something that's really useful. Asking a bunch of friends to spend eight hours cleaning is something that not everybody has time to do. The other thing that you can do is something like tell a story about the person and encourage yourself to practice self-correcting because it's in this way where you're doing it not in front of them, so you can get all your mistakes out of your system not in front of them. You're not asking the person to do the emotional labour of correcting you every time. You're just doing it out of the way, so they don't have to be on your case."
43,88,Gretchen,"The social awkwardness of like, 'Oh, do I speak up and then make this conversation about that or do I let it slide?' But then maybe they'll keep doing it, and this is something that's hurtful."
43,89,Kirby,"You can do that work without burdening the person because, okay, for my example, if I spent as much time in the beginning of my transition and grad school at the same time, I spent a lot of time correcting people and sending emails and really insisting. It took up a lot of time. I have to do it --"
43,90,Gretchen,You're trying to do a whole bunch of other stuff as well.
43,91,Kirby,"Also, I was in grad school. I was very busy. I had to do this with everybody. If people took it upon themselves to get good it on their own, that was one fewer of my friends and family that I had to worry about tutoring. My sister just did it on her own and practiced and doesn't mess up in front of me. It's fine. It means that I never have to put my mental time and budget for correcting."
43,92,Gretchen,"I think there are a lot of tips that people can have of, 'Oh, this does seem like a thing that I wanna do of like I do wanna respect people and I do wanna not hurt people,' but you're the individual pieces of that. And you're putting together a guide?"
43,93,Kirby,"It's not just me. I am absolutely indebted to the work of Bronwyn Bjorkman and Lex Konnelly who put together the They 2019 conference, which was a linguistics conference and was focused completely on nonbinary and trans pronoun use. One of the outputs of this conference is that everybody who attends is collaborating on materials and ways that we're going to share our research findings for people to use in their real lives. We are putting together brochures of -- how do you practice? How do you learn? How can you help people? These are something that we're trying to make very accessible and trying to make it very straightforward and shame free and all about allowing people to decide what they want to accomplish with their grammar because deciding to acquire a grammatical feature on purpose is making the decision that you're gonna rewrite something totally unconscious as a way to stop hurting people. That takes work. But even making the decision in the first place is really important. [Music]"

43,95,Kirby,Stay lingthusiastic! [Music]
44,1,Lauren,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics! I'm Lauren Gawne."
44,2,Gretchen,"I'm Gretchen McCulloch. Today, we're getting enthusiastic about schwa and stress. First, we made our LingComm grant goal! We're now giving out three grants to linguistics communication projects. The deadline for those applications is the 1st of June wherever you are, which is very soon, so make sure to get those applications in. That's 2020, in case you're listening from the future."
44,3,Lauren,"We're actually giving out four. We are giving out more than we originally planned, thanks to Claire Bowern funding a fourth LingComm grant on a project that looks at minoritised languages."
44,4,Gretchen,"Those grant applications are due on June 1st, 2020. If you're interested in applying for that, go to the website lingcomm.org. That's 'comm' with two Ms. You'll see all the details there."
44,5,Lauren,"If you're listening to this deep in the future, you can go to lingcomm.org to see what great projects we funded."
44,6,Gretchen,Indeed you can.
44,7,Lauren,"We now have new Lingthusiasm merch. We have little badges for you to wear through Redbubble, which is really exciting. They're super cute."
44,8,Gretchen,"Interesting! I think I would call those 'pins' or maybe 'buttons.' Whatever you call them, they are round circular things that you can pin on your clothes or backpacks that say fun linguistics things on them."
44,9,Lauren,Hm. I'd call them 'button badges' as well.
44,10,Gretchen,"I think 'buttons' is kind of ambiguous because you don't know if that's a kind of button you use that you sew into your clothing or that you pin into your clothing. Maybe I like 'pins'? Anyway, you can get these at lingthusiasm.com/merch along with more sticker designs and other Lingthusiasm merch like scarves with the International Phonetic Alphabet on them and other fun things like that."
44,11,Lauren,"This month's Patreon bonus episode is about numbers. We look at different counting systems, different number systems, and what using your fingers to count says about you. You can get access to this and 38 other bonus episodes at patreon.com/lingthusiasm. [Music]"
44,12,Gretchen,Okay. I have a puzzle for us.
44,13,Lauren,Awesome. I love a puzzle.
44,14,Gretchen,"I'm gonna give you a few words, then you can tell me what they have in common. Our words are 'about.'"
44,15,Lauren,'About.'
44,16,Gretchen,'Broken.'
44,17,Lauren,'Broken.'
44,18,Gretchen,And 'council.'
44,19,Lauren,'Council.'
44,20,Gretchen,Any thoughts for what they have in common?
44,21,Lauren,My immediate thought was I'm sad we don't have Lingthusiasm think time music.
44,22,Gretchen,We do have theme music. Maybe we could play it a bit again.
44,23,Lauren,"Hm. Ah. 'About, broken, council' -- they all start with different letters. They all have different letters in them. I'm assuming it's not something about what they mean. They're all two syllables long."
44,24,Gretchen,That's true. I should give you a couple more examples that also have this thing in common to see if that helps.
44,25,Lauren,Okay.
44,26,Gretchen,"We have 'about, broken, council, potato,' and 'support.'"
44,27,Lauren,"Oh, 'potato.' The goes my two-syllable theory. Definitely nothing semantic about their meaning. They still all have completely different letters. You've actually made it harder with more data, Gretchen. Harder. That's not useful."
44,28,Gretchen,The thing we wanna think about is not just what letters are in them but what sounds are in them.
44,29,Lauren,Right.
44,30,Gretchen,Is there any sound that all five of these words have in common?
44,31,Lauren,"If I look at the spelling, they all have completely different vowels. They don't even have the same vowels. But if I listen to how they're spoken, think about 'about, broken,' and 'council,' [Gasp] 'potato,' and 'support,' they all have schwa."
44,32,Gretchen,"They all have schwa, which I know is your favourite vowel. I have created this quiz just for you."
44,33,Lauren,Excellent. Thank you so much. They all have this /ə/ sound. It's the coolest little letter that doesn't exist as a written letter in English. It's one of the coolest sounds in English. I love it. We're doing a whole episode. It's schwa time.
44,34,Gretchen,"It's schwa time. So, /əbɑʊt/ has that /ə/ in the first syllable. /bɹoʊkən/ has that /ə/ in the second syllable. /kɑʊnsəl/ has that /ə/ there -- /pətɛɪtoʊ/ /səpoɹt/. There's the /ə/ going all the way through. Here's your second quiz. There's a special thing about this particular set of five words. They all have schwa in them, but they all have something else that's different about them."
44,35,Lauren,"They're all spelt with the actual different vowels. When I learnt that schwa was the sound that hid across all of the vowels -- it doesn't matter what one you write, if it's in an unstressed syllable, and we'll talk about that, it becomes a schwa -- it explained to me why I find writing some words so difficult. If you don't know how to spell 'potato' and someone says /pətɛɪtoʊ/, that could be a P-A, that could be a P-U. It's really hard to tell. But all of those are written with different vowels but sound the same in speech."
44,36,Gretchen,"Yeah! You get words like /dɛfənɪtli/, which was one of these words that I didn't know how to spell for the longest time. It would give me this red underline and I was like, 'Why? This looks totally reasonable to me!' Then, I had to learn that the schwa -- /dɛfənɪtli/ -- the schwa there wasn't spelled with an A, it was spelled with an I. You really can't tell in English because every single vowel letter can represent this particular vowel sound, which is really frustrating when you're a kid learning how to spell and yet is really cool when you're a linguist because it's one of these mysterious things that once you notice it, it's everywhere. Yet, you can go your whole life without noticing it."
44,37,Lauren,"We talked about all the vowels back in Episode 17 with vowel gymnastics and how, unlike consonants, vowels exist in this space and they all shift around like a multi-dimensional slide trombone. I guess that's why we went with 'gymnastics' as an analogy instead of 'multi-dimensional trombones.'"
44,38,Gretchen,"I mean, if someone wants to design a multi-dimensional trombone for me, I'll take it."
44,39,Lauren,"We talked a teeny bit about schwa in that episode, but I have been wanting to do an episode all about schwa for ages. Here we are. Exciting times."
44,40,Gretchen,"I think we should also mention what schwa looks like when it's written in the International Phonetic Alphabet because it is part of your icon or your whole icon on various different websites, is it not?"
44,41,Lauren,"Yes. If you've ever seen the upside-down E looking thing that is the Superlinguo logo, that is the sch -- so schwa is interesting in that it has a name. It also has, like all of the vowels, a representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet. That representation looks like an upside-down E. I'm not normally one of these people that has lots of opinions about fonts, but when it comes to how it's written, it is not an upside-down E. This is something I'm very fussy about."
44,42,Gretchen,What is the difference between a schwa and an upside-down lowercase E? Please tell the class because I don't know.
44,43,Lauren,"If you turn it back up the other way, it looks really unproportioned. It's like the top of the E is just way too high up. It looks all weirdly stretched."
44,44,Gretchen,"So, the thicknesses of the letters and so on are weirdly stretched? Is that the thing?"
44,45,Lauren,"Yeah. The height of that little loopy bit of the E, if you turn it back the other way and try and use it as an E, looks a bit -- it just makes it look like the E is gonna fall over. It's really wobbly."
44,46,Gretchen,Okay. I feel like we need to point this out that you know this because you made schwa cookie cutters.
44,47,Lauren,Yes. I designed and 3-D printed a schwa cookie cutter a few years ago for Christmas gingerbread.
44,48,Gretchen,"Then, a very helpful person on the internet said, 'Couldn't you just have used an E cookie cutter and turned the cookies upside-down?' and you were like, 'No, no, no, because the thickness is different.'"
44,49,Lauren,No. You absolutely cannot.
44,50,Gretchen,"I feel like, historically speaking, it probably was an upside-down E though because I know a lot of the IPA symbols are upside-down versions or rotated versions of existing letters because that way they didn't have to typeset new letters back in the metal printing days. But I believe you that, now that we have digital formats, schwa can have slightly different line thicknesses."
44,51,Lauren,"Yes. It has its own representation. It has a name that not many other vowels have names. Technically, it's a mid-central vowel, which just means it's just in the centre. It's not high. It's not low. It's not front. It's not back. It's not any of these dimensions that we talk about. It's just the most /ə/ vowel that exists, which is why everything ends up going towards it when it's not stressed because it's the least exciting thing to do with your mouth. There's actually a Wikipedia entry for the mid-central vowel -- that /ə/ vowel -- but schwa is so iconic there's also a separate Wikipedia page just to talk about it as 'schwa.' This is how strong its brand is."
44,52,Gretchen,"Schwa's brand is strong. Especially for the vowels, normally if we talk about vowels, we talk about /i/ or /ɛ/ or /ʊ/. You just say the name of the vowel -- or sometimes people say the name of the symbol. Like, 'small cap I' or --"
44,53,Lauren,'Open O.'
44,54,Gretchen,"'Open O' or something like this. Schwa has got this name that doesn't refer to the shape of its symbol, it's got its own name. The thing that's always tormented me about the name 'schwa' is, like, it's a cool name. I will grant you this. But it doesn't have schwa itself in the name."
44,55,Lauren,This is true and very disappointing.
44,56,Gretchen,"Other symbols, like 'theta' -- /θɛɪtʌ/ has a theta in it. Great. We're doing a great job. Good job, theta. Schwa does not have a schwa in it, and I find that kind of disappointing."
44,57,Lauren,Disappointing.
44,58,Gretchen,"However, I looked up the history of the name 'schwa.' Apparently, 'schwa' used to have a schwa in it and then it stopped, which I now think is even better. The word 'schwa' is from the Hebrew /ʃva/ for which the classical pronunciation was apparently /ʃəwa/."
44,59,Lauren,"Ah, so before modern Hebrew, it had a schwa in it. It was like /ʃəwa/?"
44,60,Gretchen,"Exactly. /ʃwa/, /ʃəwa/ -- maybe we should start calling it /ʃəwa/ because then it would have a /ʃəwa/ in it."
44,61,Lauren,Amazing. I think one of the things I like about the name of schwa is that the name itself encapsulates its history.
44,62,Gretchen,"Yeah. Initially /ʃva/ or /ʃəwa/ is the name of one of the sets of dots that indicates this sound -- because Hebrew writing, along with Arabic, are normally written with just the consonants. Then, if you want to indicate what the vowels are, you can add these extra little dots and bits above and below the consonants which, most of the time, aren't used but are sometimes used for children or for contexts where you wanna be super precise. One of the names of these sets of dots indicating the vowels is /ʃəwa/, which was used to indicate either the /ə/ sound, the schwa sound itself, or /ɛɪ/, which in most languages the /ɛɪ/ sound is written with what English calls a letter E. If you think of the /ɛː/ as in /kæfɛɪ/ or /foɹtɛɪ/, those Es are that /ɛɪ/ sound. This kind of explains to me why it's an upside-down E and not an upside-down literally any other vowel because every vowel letter can become a schwa sound because in this origin it could be used for either one of these two sounds."
44,63,Lauren,"Nifty. Even though it's pronounced /ʃva/ in modern Hebrew, the spelling of 'schwa' itself is actually from the German spelling for it. I think this was one of the reasons I like the name 'schwa' is that it encapsulates its history being borrowed from Hebrew orthography. Then, in the 19th Century, a lot of German linguists used it for that sound. That S-C-H spelling is the German spelling rather than any other language. Most satisfyingly, it was first used by a guy called Schmeller who has his name spelt S-C-H as well."
44,64,Gretchen,"Johann Andreas Schmeller, who also used the schwa. Maybe that's why he liked it."
44,65,Lauren,It became big in the 19th Century and definitely by the end of the 19th Century/Early 20th Century it was being used in texts to represent that sound.
44,66,Gretchen,Schwa is also very common in German. A lot of words that end in E in German have that E pronounced as a schwa. The name what in English would be Gabe -- the German name /gaːbə/ -- that /ə/ at the end is also a schwa.
44,67,Lauren,It definitely pops up in a lot of languages because it's quite efficient.
44,68,Gretchen,"You also get this optional schwa sound with Es at the end of the word in French. You can have /lɔ̃ːg/ but also /lɔ̃ːgə/, which is the word for 'long.' There's an E there that can be optionally pronounced. When it is pronounced, it's pronounced kind of like schwa. This gets to something interesting because German and French have these schwas that are spelled with the letter E at the end of a lot of their words. English, instead, has these completely silent Es at the end of a lot of its words."
44,69,Lauren,The bane of all children learning to read in English -- the silent E.
44,70,Gretchen,"Oooh, 'bane.' There's an example! Words like 'bane' and 'fame' and 'fine' and 'bone' and 'meme' -- that one is not one that I learned when I was in Grade 4 spelling class. There're all these words that end in silent E in English. The rule that I learned when I was in Grade 5 spelling class was the silent E makes the vowel say its own name."
44,71,Lauren,"Oh, I like that. I never learnt that. That's very handy, trying to get your head around the rules of reading English."
44,72,Gretchen,Yeah. It's really nice.
44,73,Lauren,I'm really jealous that I never learnt that very efficient way of thinking about what E was doing.
44,74,Gretchen,But it's a rule that's kind of unsatisfying to me as a linguist now because why should adding an extra vowel to the end of the word change how the vowel in the middle of the word is being pronounced? That's something that I found unsatisfying as a budding linguist. What sort of process is that?
44,75,Lauren,"I am going -- I mean, I know the answer. But if I had not known the answer, I would've taken a wild guess at it being retrospectively attempting to make sense of a historical process by pretending that there's some kind of reason for it."
44,76,Gretchen,"I mean, that's not not what's going on."
44,77,Lauren,The reason why they had to retrospectively come up with this rule is because the E used to be pronounced. It used to be pronounced as our friend schwa. They weren't just one syllable words. The were two syllable words. It was /banə/ -- 'bane' -- and /famə/ and /hamə/.
44,78,Gretchen,"Oh, so the schwa actually used to be pronounced there. You'd get, instead of 'fine,' like /fɪnə/. Instead of 'fame,' /famə/. Instead of 'home,' /hoʊmə/ or something like that."
44,79,Lauren,"Yes. You had two syllables instead of one syllable that we have now for 'fine,' 'fame,' 'home.' Those syllables started with a consonant, ended with a vowel. Then, over time, that schwa comes off at the end. It's not as easy to always pronounce it -- a bit like with the French example. In French at the moment, you can pronounce it, or you don't have to. It's starting to erode away at the end of a word. That was the process that happened in English."
44,80,Gretchen,"Right. This is really interesting because in English and in other Germanic languages as well there's a difference between the kinds of vowels that you can have in a syllable where there's a consonant at the end and in a syllable where there isn't. We have English words 'hid' and 'hide,' which have /ɪ/ and /ɑɪ/ in them both between H and D. But there's a word like 'hi,' but there isn't a word in English /hɪ/ or /fɪ/ or /kɪ/ or /mɪ/ even though all of these can be perfectly good as long as there's another consonant in them."
44,81,Lauren,"This is where the rules of English syllables interact with the rules of what sounds can go into them. We used to have two syllables in words like 'fine' and 'fame,' and now we have one. That little E sits there to remind us as a written fossil even though we don't pronounce it anymore."
44,82,Gretchen,"It reminds us that the vowel that's in this first syllable, which is now the only syllable, is the kind that can exist without a consonant after it. Because we can have a word like /hɑɪ/ and not a word like /hɪ/, if there's that E at the end -- you have /hɑɪd/ or something -- then that reminds us -- and by 'us' I mean people who know this history, which is not most modern contemporary English speakers -- that this is the kind of word that has the vowel that can exist in open syllables."
44,83,Lauren,"For the rest of us, it's just a handy way to spell properly."
44,84,Gretchen,There was a special reason why it was schwa that was so easily lost at the end of all of these words like 'fine' and 'home' and 'hide.' That's because schwa is what's known as a 'reduced vowel.' It's physically produced for a shorter amount of time than a full vowel like /ɑɪ/ or /i/ or even /ɪ/.
44,85,Lauren,It's what allows us to just sneak it in really quickly in syllables that we're not really focusing on.
44,86,Gretchen,"If we produce some syllables faster or quieter than other ones, those faster or quieter symbols tend to also have schwas."
44,87,Lauren,"This is why schwa crops up in all of these words regardless of what vowel they're spelt with. I'm pretty sure Lauren who really struggled to spell words because she couldn't distinguish the vowel because it was being pronounced with schwa when she was learning to spell would've said, 'Why don't we just spell all the words with schwa and be done with it?' That wouldn't be the most practical solution."
44,88,Gretchen,"The problem is, if we respell English to be consistent and every time we say schwa we write schwa, it works in the short term because we have this transparent relationship between the sound and spelling, which is nice. But the annoying thing -- this fact that you can write any English vowel letter for the sound schwa -- is also a fact about the structure of English. There are all these words that are related to each other where we can see that relationship more clearly based on the spelling than we can sometimes with the pronunciation. The spelling can help us notice when words are related to each other. If we take up a word pair like 'acid' and 'acidity' --"
44,89,Lauren,"'Acid' and 'acidity.' Well, that -ity bit on the end of 'acid' that turns it into 'acidity' also changes the vowel to a schwa."
44,90,Gretchen,"Yeah. /æsɪd/ and /əsɪdəti/ -- in the first one we have /æ/ as the first vowel and in the second one we have /ə/. Yet, it still seems pretty intuitive that these words are related to each other. It's just that when we do have this -ity on the end, we pronounce the main word -- instead of /æsɪd/, we say /əsɪd/."
44,91,Lauren,"It would be inconvenient in the even medium turn to lose the relationship between, say, 'courage' and 'courageous' just because we have that -ous on the end of 'courageous.'"
44,92,Gretchen,"It's the same thing there. /kʌɹəd͡ʒ/ -- the second syllable -age, there's a schwa. But /kʌɹɛɪd͡ʒəs/ -- now there's a different vowel there. It's just because we've added the -ous on the end. Yet, it's nice that these two words that are very clearly related to each other still look the same."
44,93,Lauren,"I guess it's particularly true as well of those word pairs in English that only differ because of stress. Like /ˈɹɛˌkəɹd/ and /ˌɹəˈkoɹd/ -- only different because of stress. Then, we'd be spelling them differently because each one has a schwa in the opposite place."
44,94,Gretchen,"/ˈɹɛˌkəɹd/ -- the schwa is in the /-əɹd/. /ˌɹəˈkoɹd/ -- your schwa is in the /ɹə-/. You'd have to /ʃwap/ the -- swap the [stutters] /ʃwaz/ -- /ʃwap/ the /ʃwʌz/? Wow. That's really hard to say. Swap the schwas. You wouldn't know what vowel to recover from the syllable once you started stressing it. It's the same thing with -ity and -ous. When you make 'acid' into 'acidity' and 'courage' into 'courageous,' instead of stressing the /æ/ and the /kəɹ/, you're stressing the /ɪd/ and the /æd͡ʒ/, if you will."
44,95,Lauren,Adding the extra bit to the word shifts where the stress is.
44,96,Gretchen,"It's these unstressed syllables where schwa -- not every unstressed syllable in English is a schwa, but a heck of a lot of them are."
44,97,Lauren,I think we'll keep the spelling system as it is.
44,98,Gretchen,"This was something that always used to come up for me back when I used to teach Intro to Linguistics. People would be trying to write things in the International Phonetic Alphabet for the very first time, so they'd go through each word, and they'd say it really slowly and carefully. What that would mean is that instead of saying /əsɪdəti/, they'd say something like /æsɪdɪti/. Okay. Or, instead of saying /kʌɹəd͡ʒ/, /kʌɹɛɪd͡ʒəs/, they'd have /kʌɹɛɪd͡ʒʌs/, /kʌɹɹɛd͡ʒ/."
44,99,Lauren,"They've gone back to stressing every syllable, so the schwas evaporate."
44,100,Gretchen,"Right! They'd write these words and they'd have no schwas in them all over the place. You'd have to say, 'You can say this word like this -- if you're really saying it slowly and carefully, and you were saying each syllable at once maybe to help someone spell it, you do have the full vowel there some level,' psychologically, for a lot of people, especially because of the spelling that's influencing you to tell you it's there. But in normal speech at a regular pace, most of the time you do say schwas a lot. It's an interesting tension where many of our schwas actually represent a sound that we could recover if you say the word slowly and carefully enough, which is also a reason to keep the spelling where it is because there is some psychological reality to the non-schwa version as well."
44,101,Lauren,"This discussion is very English-focused, I should say, because it's something that English seems to do in particular in terms of having this kind of stress and this reducing to schwa on unstressed syllables. In fact, it's a fairly prominent feature of the English accent. I imagine it's something that gets transferred when English speakers are learning to speak other languages. It's probably the closest I've come to having the ability to understand what the English accent in other languages must sound like to native speakers of those languages. They must just think that we're failing to hear vowels all over the place."
44,102,Gretchen,"'Why do all of your vowels become the same vowel?' I think the inverse is also the case is that it's one of the trickiest things for people who are learning English from a language that doesn't do this, which is most of them, to do is be constantly trying to hit this vowel that I don't even have. 'Don't you want your vowels to all be very distinct from each other?' Schwa or not schwa is this very English thing. The stress part about it being very important which syllable's stressed and which part of which word is stressed -- that's also a very English thing. I find the most interesting place to notice how important stress is in English is when it comes to poetry."
44,103,Lauren,Sure. Because a lot of poetry relies on having certain numbers of syllables. Using stress is one way to explore the rhythm of a poem or a poetic construction.
44,104,Gretchen,"Right. Some of the oldest English Mother Goose rhymes, nursery rhymes, have a consistent number of stressed bits per line rather than a consistent number of syllables. If you have something like 'Hickory dickory dock, the mouse ran up the clock.' There's three stress bits per line, but the number of syllables is quite different. The same thing with limericks in English, it's not that there's the same number of syllables in each line, it's that the stress pattern is you have to have three stressed syllables, three stressed syllables, two stress, two stress, three stress. You can do that with a varying number of actual syllables in it. Something like, 'There once was a man from Nantucket,' three stresses -- 'once,' 'man,' 'tuck.' Nine syllables. But 'A tutor who tooted the flute,' also three stress -- 'tu,' 'too,' 'flute.' That's eight syllables. And 'A wonderful bird is the pelican,' ten syllables but still three stresses."
44,105,Lauren,"It's funny. My brain is so tuned to listening to the stress in these, I actually found it hard to count the syllables as you were going because I was so tuned into the limerick structure of stress."
44,106,Gretchen,"A lot of very English-y poetry styles, as long as you get the stress right, you can really mess with the syllables because English pays a lot of attention to the stress. Whereas, in French, they don't have this individual, unpredictable stress at the word level the way English does at all. There's no /ˈɹɛˌkəɹd/ versus /ˌɹəˈkoɹd/ in French. Everything just gets a bit of stress at the end of the phrase or sentence or utterance or whatever you're saying. You might say something like 'Bonjour,' but you could also say, 'Bonjour, comment ça va?' and you just stress the 'jour' or the 'va.' You don't have to go anywhere in between and stress anything else. This means that French poetry can't do this stress counting thing because there's no stresses for them to count."
44,107,Lauren,"Ah. Normally, I spend a lot of time going, 'Oh, poor English speakers. They're missing out.' But poor French speakers! They're missing out on limericks."
44,108,Gretchen,I really don't know how you do a limerick in French. I think you'd have to pick a number of syllables that is approximately equivalent and just do that.
44,109,Lauren,"We talked about this schwa-syllable relationship being very English-focused for this episode, but it's not the only language in which schwa appears and is a little bit easy to drop once you have reduced the pronunciation of schwa. French was one example you had. In Indo-Aryan languages as well -- these are the languages of the same Into-European family as English but they're over on the Indian subcontinent, so Hindi. I know about this because I had to learn Nepali. They have schwa as a vowel. A bit like the Hebrew writing system, for this vowel in particular, they just don't write it down. You have to know when to pronounce this vowel by memorising. For some languages in the family it's just gone altogether. It's another example of how schwa in some languages can be really eroded. But not in all languages."
44,110,Gretchen,"This is actually true in Miꞌkmaq as well, which is an Algonquian language spoken in Eastern Canada. In their writing system they use the apostrophe to represent the schwa sound, but the apostrophe is only added when the schwa is quote-unquote 'unpredictable.' If you can predict the schwa, then you just put in the schwa where you know it's supposed to go because as a speaker you say it. Of course, I am not very good -- I don't speak Miꞌkmaq so I'm not particularly good at predicting where it goes."
44,111,Lauren,Unpredictable schwa is almost cooler than unstressed schwa.
44,112,Gretchen,"You can kind of predict it. Speakers actually know how to do it properly, but it's not always represented in the writing system which is, I guess, something it has in common with Nepali."
44,113,Lauren,Schwa has so many cheeky personalities.
44,114,Gretchen,"Schwa also shows up in English -- speaking of being cheeky -- as the vowel sound that people end up producing, if you're an English speaker, when you're trying not to make any vowel sound at all. If you're trying to say the sound that the letter B makes, but you don't wanna say B, you just wanna say that sound by itself, you probably end up with /bə/, which is still a vowel, it's just schwa. Because that's the least vowel you can make."
44,115,Lauren,Just adding a little bit so you can get that /bə/ across.
44,116,Gretchen,"Yeah. It also shows up sometimes in people's names. I knew somebody called /ksɛnjə/ and a lot of English speakers couldn't pronounce that /ksə/, the KS, at the beginning of her name, so a lot of people ended up saying /kəsɛnjə/ by inserting a little schwa between because that was how they were able to keep both the K and the S."
44,117,Lauren,"Very handy. Although, I like unpredictable schwa in Miꞌkmaq, one of the best things about schwa popping up in the particular context of unstressed syllables in English means that schwa is set up for being just a really great source of jokes because, when it comes to English, schwa is never stressed. I think that's a life motto we can all get behind."
44,118,Gretchen,"This means that there are people who've made t-shirts saying, 'I want to be a schwa, it's never stressed.'"
44,119,Lauren,There's a great photo from Sandy Abuadas who has made cookies for her students with schwa on them so that her students' finals will be stressless.
44,120,Gretchen,I love it! It's so good.
44,121,Lauren,It was very cute.
44,122,Gretchen,"I think the stress part -- in the technical sense, there's this very tempting pun with the stress part in the vernacular sense."
44,123,Lauren,"I think because it's a sound that is everywhere and ubiquitous but, until you study linguistics, you don't know that it is all around you. Not only is it around you, but it has its own symbol and it has its own name. I think that's why it's a classic linguist iconography to have fun with."
44,124,Gretchen,I hope that learning about schwa has not been stressful! [Music]

45,1,Gretchen,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics! I'm Gretchen McCulloch."
45,2,Lauren,"I'm Lauren Gawne. Today, we're getting enthusiastic about language families and reconstructing proto-languages. First, we're excited to announce that the LingComm grants have been granted. We have amazing winners that are listed in the show notes page or on the website lingcomm.org."
45,3,Gretchen,"You can stay tuned for further news from our four grantees. As their projects start coming out, we'll be telling you about them as well."
45,4,Lauren,"Speaking of things that are out and in the world, I'm very excited that P. M. Freestone's Crown of Smoke, which is the conclusion to the Shadowscent duology, is now available. The UK edition is available worldwide. I created the Aramteskan language for those books.

45,8,Gretchen,"While we're talking about history and getting kids excited about linguistics, can we go back into really ancient history and talk about how I got into linguistics?"
45,9,Lauren,"Oh my gosh, yes."
45,10,Gretchen,"I've told part of this story before. I first encountered linguistics when I was around 12 or 13, and I happened across a pop linguistics book on a bookshelf --"
45,11,Lauren,"Ah, so this was started by a specific book! How interesting."
45,12,Gretchen,"This was started by a specific book that I still have. I came across this bookshelf, and I just sort of picked it up because it looked like pop science and I knew I liked pop science. Then, I got about halfway through it, and I was reading it and I was like, 'This is so cool! This is the coolest thing! This book is never leaving my possession again!' Fortunately, it belonged to my grandparents and they were willing to let me steal it."
45,13,Lauren,Nice of them.
45,14,Gretchen,One of the things that really sparked my imagination when I was reading this pop linguistics book was that it had this chapter about proto-world.
45,15,Lauren,Proto-world?
45,16,Gretchen,I feel like you have to say it like that -- PROTO-WOOOORLD.
45,17,Lauren,"Ok, let me try. I was about PROTO-WOOOORLD!"
45,18,Gretchen,"Exactly. This is this tremendously exciting idea that maybe we could figure out what the oldest language in the world sounds like. To me, at the time, this seemed incredibly exciting. What an ambitious task. All of the 7,000 languages in the world, you could figure out what they might have in common. Unfortunately, as I discovered --"
45,19,Lauren,"I don't want to disappoint 13-year-old Gretchen, but that's a bit of a tall order."
45,20,Gretchen,"Unfortunately, as I learned more about linguistics, I also learned that proto-world is not a thing."
45,21,Lauren,"But, having said that, the ability to take what we know about languages now and work backwards is definitely a thing. That's the field of historical linguistics."
45,22,Gretchen,"Right! What we can do is we can go back at this time depth of a few thousand years -- 2,000 years to maybe 5,000 years -- and figure out what languages had in common there and figure out some larger language families. Fortunately, very interestingly, language is probably some hundreds of thousands of years old. There's just no way of going back to that extreme time depth. But, for this couple thousand years that we can do, it's super interesting."
45,23,Lauren,I think it's worth explaining why things get too squishy to go back to PROTO-WOOOORLD by looking at how we start doing historical linguistics and why you can only go back so far.
45,24,Gretchen,Exactly. I think the language that a lot of people think of when we think about reconstructing historical languages is this language called Proto-Indo-European. You don't have say to PROTO-INDO-EUROPEAN because this one's pretty solid.
45,25,Lauren,Yeah.
45,26,Gretchen,"This is the reconstructed ancestor language of many of the languages that are spoken in Europe and the Indian subcontinent. Not all of them. There are some that aren't related to this, like Basque and Hungarian. But most of the languages spoken in Europe, and a large number of languages spoken in India, all have this relationship."
45,27,Lauren,"I think it's not super surprising to people that languages are related. As an English speaker, if you hear German or Dutch, you're like, 'I can recognize some of those words. They're easy.'"
45,28,Gretchen,"I don't think it really takes a whole reconstructing proto-language to hear the English word 'apple' and the German word 'Apfel' and be like, 'Hm, I wonder if there's a connection there.'"
45,29,Lauren,'Woah! They're related?!'
45,30,Gretchen,"Or even better, the Dutch word which is literally also 'appel' but spelled differently. I don't think that's rocket science."
45,31,Lauren,"What I think is impressive though, and where historical linguistics really came into its own, is looking at similarities but also differences and figuring out how those differences were systematic, so you can work back in time. If you think about as languages go on the sounds change so, if you put that in reverse, you can reverse those sound changes to figure out what an earlier version of the language might've sounded like."
45,32,Gretchen,"You can make fun of this apple/Apfel example, but there are connections that are a little bit less intuitive. One of my favourite connections is you get these very large and elaborate tables, which we cannot convey tables in an audio podcast form --"
45,33,Lauren,"Not pleasantly, anyway."
45,34,Gretchen,"-- that go through and look at particular words. You have a word like 'pater' in Latin and 'father' in English and 'pitar' in Sanskrit and 'Vater' in German. You can look at then and be like, 'Huh, all of those languages except for English have that T in the middle.' English has a /θ/ sound, which isn't that different from a T. You have 'padre' in Spanish. You're like, 'Uh, D, that's not that different from a T.' Maybe there was an ancestor language that had a word like this for 'father' that also had a T in the middle. Or if you have 'pater' from Latin with a P, and Sanskrit both have a P, and German has a V, and English has an F, you can be like, okay, well, we have two Ps -- well, several Ps -- and a couple Fs and Vs. Maybe there was one of these, especially the P because Latin and Sanskrit are spoken pretty far apart -- German and English are spoken pretty close together, just geographically -- so maybe the ancestor language had a P there as well. You can do that comparison at this very, very nitty gritty level for a whole bunch of individual words and figure out which sounds change. Again, if you see P changing to F from Latin to English in 'father,' you should also see P changing to F in other words. The Latin word 'pes, pedes,' meaning 'foot,' it's cognate with foot because, again, there's that P to F change. Well, German is 'Fuß,' which isn't a V, so, again, you have to account for this. You can go through and make these very elaborate tables with cross comparisons."
45,35,Lauren,"My favourite historical sound change comparison, because I think it's always good to have a favourite, is the -- if you look across a lot of languages that are related to Latin, they have a /k/ sound where the German languages, which branched off at a slightly different time and in a slightly different way, have a /h/ sound, which means that the word 'canine,' which is the Latin for 'dog,' and the word 'hound' are actually historically related. That /k/h/ is one example of the change."
45,36,Gretchen,Because they both have this N afterwards.
45,37,Lauren,"Yeah. There're other changes that happen as well. 'Heart' and 'cordial,' or 'cordis,' which is where a lot of our medical words around 'heart/coronary,' come from, that's that Latin /k/ again."
45,38,Gretchen,"My favourite example with English 'heart' -- which is, again, there's your H -- my favourite example of the specific /k/ to /h/ change is in 'cornucopia' versus 'horn of plenty.'"
45,39,Lauren,It's right there.
45,40,Gretchen,"That 'cornu-' at the beginning of 'cornucopia,' that's a horn! And the '-orn' part, 'corn' and 'horn,' you really see a lot of similarities because the rest of the sounds in those words haven't changed as much."
45,41,Lauren,"The nice thing about 'cornucopia' is that we borrowed 'copious' from Latin to mean 'a lot.' Because it wasn't just a word that stayed in English and had the systematic sound change, we didn't borrow it as 'hopious.' We just borrowed it with the Latin sound. That's the difference between words that are borrowed and words that are related."
45,42,Gretchen,"The neat thing about doing this comparative reconstruction is that you need to figure out, okay, first of all, what do we know about the history of this word? Because the word 'copious' in English isn't gonna give us evidence for what was going on in the ancestor language of the Germanic languages because we know that it was borrowed from Latin much more recently. First of all, figuring out where all these words came from and then doing the comparison only with that bit of core vocabulary that did have all of the sound changes happen to it. The fun thing is that, as an English speaker, because we've borrowed so many words from other European languages at various times, is that we can often see these sound changes happen even within English. Even if you don't speak Latin, you can be like, 'Oh, I know the word 'cornucopia.'' You can see this happen within English as well because we've borrowed words at different time depths."
45,43,Lauren,"One thing I'm always blown away with, with historical linguistics doing this comparison and then working backwards to reconstruct an older language, is just how many words it requires, how much knowledge of which words are a borrowing and which words are original to the language. For every sound rule there's always these sub-rule exceptions because in front of some verb something doesn't happen. It's this meticulous work. As computers have become more advanced, the scale of the work has expanded so much because you can crunch more data. There's very large spreadsheets and tables that happen to build these reconstructions. But even before that, people could go so far back to reconstruct what they think words were like before written records because writing is actually a relatively new invention, especially writing of sounds and not just images for words."
45,44,Gretchen,"Writing is so new. It's so interesting to look back at this part before written records exist. This is why people call them proto-languages. Any language that's preceded by a 'proto' is something that's been reconstructed. Sometimes, you get Old English. We have records of that. We have books about it. But if it's a proto-language, it's specifically called that because we don't have any sort of written records and it's been figured out in that sort of way. I think what I really love about historical linguistics is the way that it pays attention -- the people who do it -- pay such close attention to what's attested and what's reconstructed and the sources of information. There's this convention in historical linguistics to write an asterisk before proto-words. This confused me coming from the rest of linguistics because in the rest of linguistics, you put an asterisk before a word or sentence that's not grammatical."
45,45,Lauren,Or like in my instant message chat where I frequently have to use an asterisk because I misspelt a word and need to correct it.
45,46,Gretchen,"Well, okay, there's that too. I think that is a bit later of a usage than the linguistic sense. Normally, in most of linguistics, an asterisk is used for 'This is ungrammatical.' This is like 'horn plenty of' or something like that, which you wouldn't say those words in that order. Historical linguists use that asterisk as a reminder to themselves to be humble about it. It's not that it's ungrammatical; it's that it's unattested. 'This one isn't real' in the same sort of way as like, 'This is ungrammatical. It's negative evidence. This one isn't real.' Except, for the historical linguists, it's 'We've put in a whole bunch of effort and we've had all these theoretical debates and we've come up with our best effort possible with a lot of sweat and tears to figure out this thing that we still want to acknowledge as not real.' The asterisk there is really a sort of intellectual humility."
45,47,Lauren,"You begin to see why proto-world would be such a challenge because, by the time you get to Proto-Indo-European, which was probably spoken 4,000 years B.C.E. -- so you're looking at 5,000 to 6,000 years ago for Proto-Indo-European -- you are making a lot of guesses to get to that point. Then, if you try and compare it to any other proto-language that's been reconstructed, you're now making guesses out of two guesses which becomes very slippery."
45,48,Gretchen,"It's like if you have one number that's fairly uncertain that's got a margin of error -- you know, plus or minus 5% -- and you have another number that also has a margin of error of plus or minus 5%, and then you multiply together, you suddenly have a number that has an error of, I think it's plus or minus 25% because I think you also multiply the margins of errors. Don't quote me on the statistics, but the point is you get a worse number -- a less precise number that has a greater margin of error. The same thing happens when you try to do that. There are some attempts to say, 'Okay, well, even if we can't do PROTO-WOOOORLD, maybe we can find an ancestor language of Proto-Indo-European that is spoken in a slightly larger area,' but even that is still very speculative because of the time depth involved."
45,49,Lauren,"Unless we discover some way that spoken and signed languages left fossils or we invent time travel, neither of which feel particularly plausible, we're stuck with the --"
45,50,Gretchen,I always say this is the first thing that I'm gonna do whenever I get my hands on a time machine is I'm gonna go back and retrace some language families. People just don't seem to understand why this is such an important idea.
45,51,Lauren,So compelling. I would fund the heck out of that time travel research.
45,52,Gretchen,"Thank you! I appreciate it. We need to write a grant. It's still really neat. If you know a couple of Indo-European languages, you can use it to make nifty connections. I definitely managed to figure out some various Dutch vocabulary from my knowledge of English and German. I was able to be like, oh, I can probably triangulate on what this word means because I know what the sound changes have been. That's really satisfying. I also think that when we talk about historical linguistics and comparative reconstruction, it's easy to get down the Indo-European rabbit hole because it's so satisfying to do this with languages where you already know potentially more than one of them or at least you have a bunch of borrowed cognate vocabulary to work with and to see these connections between languages that you're maybe more familiar with. There's a whole bunch of comparative reconstruction that's also happened in language families in the rest of the world as well."
45,53,Lauren,"Yes. I'd hate for people to think that this is the only language that this has happened for. It is an area where there has been a lot of written records, and I think that has helped drive a lot of that work and a lot of local interest from Europeans who are interested in tracing their own languages back."
45,54,Gretchen,"I mean, the Indo-European languages have been written down longer than some languages, not as long as others. You could go pretty far back with Semitic languages too, I expect, because they've been written down for a long time. One thing that I find really interesting is -- so Proto-Algonquian, which is the ancestor language of the Algonquian languages which are spoken in a large portion of Canada, especially -- not in the north -- but a large portion from British Columbia all the way to Nova Scotia and the Maritimes on the east and into the north-eastern United States in New England. There's about 30 Algonquian languages. Proto-Algonquian is a really well attested, well reconstructed language family that is the ancestor language from which these languages are descended. The estimate's that it was probably spoken around 2,000 to 3,000 years ago and, like with the apple/Apfel example, it's very clear at a certain level to speakers that these languages are similar and that these languages feel like cousins. If you get some speakers of different Algonquian languages in a room together -- and I've been to the Algonquian conference when I was in grad school and you had different speakers and different linguists who had researched these languages -- sometimes they just sit around being like, 'What's your word for this? Oh, yeah, we have that.' It can be really fun."
45,55,Lauren,"Okay. So, no one is like, surprised by Proto-Algonquian as a concept?"
45,56,Gretchen,"No one is surprised by Proto-Algonquian as a concept. I noticed when researching for this episode that there had actually been a linguist who had noticed this connection 10 years before one of the early famous speeches about Indo-European. Even if you want European intellectual tradition bragging rights, which are their own thing -- it is definitely not where all knowledge comes from -- but even if you want to participate in that tradition, this language family has been talked about for a long time."
45,57,Lauren,Cool!
45,58,Gretchen,"I should probably mention a few of the names of the languages in Algonquian because many of them are languages that people have probably heard of -- Ojibwe, Cree, Massachusett, Menominee, Wampanoag, Blackfoot, Mi'kmaq, Innu. There're a whole bunch of languages that are in this family. A lot of words from them have been borrowed into English at this point. A lot of words for concepts that English speakers encountered in North America, things like 'moose,' 'chipmunk,' 'moccasin,' 'hickory,' 'caribou,' 'racoon,' 'skunk,' 'succotash,' 'toboggin,' 'woodchuck.' Some of these were reshaped on the model of more English-looking words. 'Woodchuck' was reshaped. But a lot of words for animals and concepts in North America were ultimately borrowed from an Algonquian language."
45,59,Lauren,That's really cool. I assume that place names are probably also somewhere this pops up a lot as well.
45,60,Gretchen,"Tons of place names -- 'Ottawa,' 'Massachusetts,' 'Connecticut.' I mean, and there are other indigenous languages spoken in this area. Iroquoian languages are also spoken in this area and they're not related, but they were some of the first languages that European settlers had contact with. A lot of their words for things in the North American continent became the English words for the items as well."
45,61,Lauren,"Once you have a word for 'raccoon,' you can take that word with you across the country."
45,62,Gretchen,What's also really interesting is that these languages had structural and grammatical similarities as well.
45,63,Lauren,"That's cool because so far, we've only talked about doing historical work by comparing words and sounds and working backwards from them. Of course, we also have grammar, and grammar between closely related languages can be very similar and tends to be more similar. If you've learnt a language close to English or you've learnt English from the basis of speaking another Germanic language and then learnt a grammar of a very different language family, I think that's probably something you've encountered before."
45,64,Gretchen,"Indo-European languages, for example, often have a grammatical gender distinction between masculine, feminine, and neuter. Some of them have collapsed some of those genders into just masculine and feminine, or neuter and common, with common as the collapsed masculine-plus-feminine gender. Or in some cases, like English, they only retained relics of that on the pronoun system. Algonquian languages have an animate/inanimate contrast, which is also a way of splitting things up. They also do particular things with the verb depending on whether they're dealing with animate nouns or inanimate nouns. There's a lot of ways that that animate/inanimate contrast shows up and goes all the way through the grammar."
45,65,Lauren,A bit like with sounds we look for that systematic change with the grammar. We can look at systematic ways that it pops up across each individual language and then compare them to see if we can find commonalities.
45,66,Gretchen,"Sometimes, reconstructing sounds can help us find bits of grammar. One of the ways where animate versus inanimate shows up in Algonquian languages is that the way of making the plural is different. If we can reconstruct a plural suffix for the animate nouns and we can reconstruct a plural suffix for the inanimate ones, then that must mean that they had this distinction between the two suffixes because otherwise they wouldn't both exist and they wouldn't exist in all the daughter languages."
45,67,Lauren,This is one of the fun things about historical linguistics is that it lets you dabble in all the different parts. You have to know a little bit about how sounds might work and change and how grammatical structures work and how they might change across languages as well. You get to look at all the different parts of how language works.
45,68,Gretchen,"Indo-European languages in general don't distinguish between inclusive and exclusive 'we.' You know, 'You and me, we're going to go to the movies' versus 'Me and this other person, we're gonna go to the movies, and we're leaving you behind.'"
45,69,Lauren,"Oh, okay. But at least I know. At least I'm not waiting for my invitation over here."
45,70,Gretchen,"At least you know. You're not waiting. The Algonquian languages all do make this distinction. That's something you can reconstruct because all these related languages make it. Whereas, Indo-European languages, none of them make this distinction. This is the kinds of fine-grained grammatical stuff that can last for thousands of years that this distinction sticks around, or it doesn't."
45,71,Lauren,So great.
45,72,Gretchen,There's this really great website the Algonquian Linguistics Atlas that has audio files of speakers saying various words and phrases in different Algonquian languages. They're kind of mapped around. You can click on sound files and hear what they sound like and how they're written in various different areas. We'll link to that.
45,73,Lauren,"In Australia, you also have this one language family reconstructed that has a really large geographic spread. That's known as the Pama-Nyungan language family, which is made up of the Pama languages, which is a subgroup, and the Nyungan ones. They're just talked about together as a single group. In fact, it's such a large group -- it's around 300 languages, we think -- that the dozen or so other language families that sit across the top of Australia are all just known together as the Non-Pama-Nyungan languages. Even though they're not related to each other, they're just lumped into being not this major language family."
45,74,Gretchen,"I feel like maybe I should clarify that the Algonquian language family is definitely not the only language family in North America. It's a very big one, but there are a lot of languages, especially on the west coast, that are in smaller groups. In towards the south into the US, there are various other groups as well. It's not quite as cohesive as the Australian picture."
45,75,Lauren,"Yeah. It's very diverse at the top of Australia. There's a lot of diversity within this Pama-Nyungan language family, but it definitely dominates in terms of the number of languages in Australia. One thing that I obviously don't just find upsetting because of its relevance to historical linguistics, but you're really working with fragmented records in Australia in a way that is obviously because of a direct and traumatic experience of colonization where you had an incredibly rich oral tradition, and you still have an incredibly rich oral tradition across millennia. Oral traditions have incredible ways of conveying rich time depth of information. It's just a very different experience to the written traditions we're used to with things like Latin and Old English. It means that, when those channels of passing on knowledge and passing on language were lost, we really lost this ability to tell the full story of Australia. A lot of the work that's done is done with very fragmentary records of word lists or, sometimes, just a couple of words we know -- maybe a few key words in a particular language. When I read about historical linguistics in Australia, I'm always just left with this really heavy-hearted feeling about the stories that we've lost in being able to tell this big time-depth story."
45,76,Gretchen,That's huge.
45,77,Lauren,"Because we have these really fragmentary lists of data, a lot of what we can say for certain about similarities and the things that make up the Proto-Pama-Nyungan language is around the sounds that are in the language. Like many of the Pama-Nyungan languages spoken today, it was a language without fricatives, so it doesn't have sounds like /s/ or /z/ that we take for granted in a lot of the other language families in the world and can make it very striking as a language family."
45,78,Gretchen,Interesting.
45,79,Lauren,"It had three vowels which, again, is definitely on the smaller side for human languages."
45,80,Gretchen,Which three vowels -- or is that not agreed on?
45,81,Lauren,"An /i/, /a/, and /u/. The cool thing is, when you have fewer vowels, you do more interesting things with the vowel space."
45,82,Gretchen,"When I was learning Arabic, which also only has three vowels, a lot of things that you might think of as different vowels in English are considered just like versions of the same vowel in Arabic."
45,83,Lauren,Yeah. It's really neat.
45,84,Gretchen,I think I noticed when I was visiting Australia that a lot of the place names that were based on local languages had /ŋ/ sounds in them. Is that something that's true of Pama-Nyungan?
45,85,Lauren,"Yes. The velar nasal gets a lot of use. It's in Proto-Pama-Nyungan as well. Although, when it occurs at the start of a word, we often have changed that so it's easier for English speakers to pronounce."
45,86,Gretchen,"Ah, yes. That old story. I mean, there are some languages in North America that were wiped out very early. We don't have a lot of records. One of them is Beothuk, which was spoken in Newfoundland. We know that, but we don't know very much about the language or the speakers in general. It's not even clear whether it was Proto-Algonquian or not -- whether it was its own language family. Another one, Wampanoag, has relatively recently been part of a pretty successful language revitalisation movement because they did leave written records -- quite a lot of them -- so speakers were able to bring the language of their ancestors back. Overall, a lot of the Algonquian languages still have at least some speakers around and many of them have revitalisation movements and these kinds of things because there is still sufficient language transmission happening or being very actively worked on to continue happening in a lot of these areas. It takes effort but it's not down to the situation where you only have a couple word lists."
45,87,Lauren,"Sometimes, when you see these very neat historical trees -- much like animal evolution trees, people will draw these tress of the evolution of languages like Proto-Indo-European as they split off into all the language families and then the languages we know today -- sometimes I feel like you can get so into paying attention to words in tables and sound comparisons you can kind of a forget that there's a big story of human history that happens across thousands and thousands of years when you're doing historical linguistics."
45,88,Gretchen,"Yeah, and that languages have this history but a lot of this history, I think, to get back to this question what can we even know, is related to other types of activities that happen in the world, whether that's conquest or war or people moving from one area to another. Those histories also show up in what we can know about language."
45,89,Lauren,"So far, we've talked about sounds. We've talked about grammar. But we can also look at which words you end up being able to reconstruct all the way through to the proto-language. The word for 'mobile phone' we're not going to be able to reconstruct back to Old English even if we have records or not."
45,90,Gretchen,"Oh, no! Really?"
45,91,Lauren,The words that we can reconstruct can tell us potentially something about what people were talking about back in a language before we have written records of it.
45,92,Gretchen,"Right. The idea being that if these languages all had a common ancestor word for 'fish' or something, we know that people must have had fish because otherwise they wouldn't have had a word for it."
45,93,Lauren,"Yes. There's been a lot of work on Proto-Indo-European for this just because there's been a lot of work on Proto-Indo-European and there's a lot of data for it. We know, for example, that words that we can reconstruct all the way back include domestic animals like 'cow,' 'sheep,' 'goats,' and 'pigs,' and words for dairy foods like 'milk' and words for 'wool.' That gives you an idea of the kind of agriculture they were performing."
45,94,Gretchen,The level of technology.
45,95,Lauren,"Well, yeah, we can reconstruct a word 'wagon,' and there's an indication that they had access to the technology of the wheel."
45,96,Gretchen,That's some technology right there.
45,97,Lauren,It's an exciting technology back then.
45,98,Gretchen,"They're a couple hypotheses about where this means that Proto-Indo-European was spoken. I think a lot of people these days think that it was spoken in the steppe -- the Pontic-Caspian steppes -- zone in Eastern Europe. That's around present-day Ukraine and southern Russian. There's also a hypothesis that it was spoken in Anatolia, which is pretty much modern-day Turkey, somewhere in that general direction, but there's still people doing archaeological research and various kinds of research to try to figure out exactly where. One thing you can do is say we're quite sure that it wasn't spoken on an ocean because there isn't a Proto-Indo-European word for 'ocean,' but there was for other smaller bodies of water. They had access to some water but not the big one. You can figure out things like that. For Proto-Algonquian, people think that it was spoken somewhere -- I think the recent research suggests that it's spoken immediately west of Lake Superior, based on looking at the names of plants and animals that are across the different Algonquian languages. Those are found in that particular area."
45,99,Lauren,"Once again, you have to add some knowledge of semantics and then some botany and agriculture to your list of things you need to know about when figuring out proto-languages."
45,100,Gretchen,"My favourite recent example of this is that a lot of people have been very excited these days about the fact that many European languages use a verb that's like 'to hamster' to mean 'hoard.' German has 'hamstern.' Dutch has something very similar. There's a bunch of different languages -- I think some Slavic languages have it. People were like, why doesn't English have this great word 'to hamster'? I was asking this on Twitter the other day and somebody pointed out to me that the range of the European wild hamster doesn't extend into Britain. It's only on the European continent."
45,101,Lauren,That is excellent. Maybe we have a hypothesis there about the extent of linguistic and hamster spreads.
45,102,Gretchen,"Well, English does have the word 'to squirrel,' which means something quite similar because we do have squirrels in English-speaking areas more than we used to have hamsters. No claims about Proto-Indo-European there, but it's an interesting example of how geography and climate and animals and plants and botany and so on, the flora and fauna, can influence what we know about languages as well."
45,103,Lauren,"We've talked about three different proto-groups. We haven't even talked about isolate languages for which you can't find any related languages to do any comparison. There are a whole bunch of other language families that have been constructed and reconstructed back to proto-forms. I work on Tibetan languages which are, depending on how far back you're willing to make educated conjectures, are either part of the Tibeto-Burman family, which includes the languages of Tibet and the languages of Burma and that whole region, that some people claim we can reconstruct even further back to include the Sinosphere, so the languages of China, which would be a much larger and older group. That's a part of the world that I work in directly in terms of proto-language reconstruction."
45,104,Gretchen,Another proto-language that I'm just a huge fan of is Proto-Bantu.
45,105,Lauren,"Yeah, that's a good one."
45,106,Gretchen,"I studied a very, very small amount of Kinyarwanda when I was in undergrad. Ever since then I've been like, Bantu languages are great! Proto-Bantu is really neat because one of the things that a lot of people know about the Bantu languages is that they have all of these noun classes. It turns out like, yeah, you can reconstruct all of these noun classes. Of course, there's controversy about exactly how many can be reconstructed to Proto-Bantu. A lot of the -- there are a certain set that are very well-established, and then there's another area where there's more controversy. We can also reconstruct where people lived and what technology they had. Agriculture, fishing, and the use of boats based on the vocabulary were already known to the Bantu people before they started expanding into different areas and the languages started diverging, but iron working was something that showed up later once they're already expanded. You can place the date of expansion between 3,000 and 800 B.C.E. These things you can know about these people so long ago is really neat."
45,107,Lauren,"Gretchen, if we wanted to get to proto-world, we would have to take all of these proto-families that people have spent centuries now meticulously working back to these incredibly tentative hypotheses about how these languages work and you would have to go back even further to get to proto-world. How does grown-up Gretchen feel about 13-year-old Gretchen's aspirations?"
45,108,Gretchen,"Well, I went back -- and I still have this book -- I went back, and I looked at it again for the first time in many, many years."
45,109,Lauren,"Oh, my gosh, amazing! What was it like to revisit?"
45,110,Gretchen,"I mean, fortunately, the chapter was only nine pages long, so there was only so much damage they could do in nine pages. I'm not naming the book. It was a great book for getting a 12-year-old interested in linguistics."
45,111,Lauren,It served its purpose.
45,112,Gretchen,"I haven't read anything else of it in many years, but I was very willing to be very credulous about a lot of these statements. One of the things that I noticed is that, so we're able to go back a couple thousand years by comparing what we have of existent languages or sometimes records of languages from a few hundred years ago or about 1,000/2,000 years ago you can go back an additional hop step of many 2,000 to 3,000 years. That's where we can go. The problem is time depth-wise. It's not just like, okay, well, what if we take each of these languages and compare them. Even if we could do all of this methodology, which we can't always, that only takes us back another potential hop step of another couple thousand years. We need to go back, like, 100,000 years. We need to do this step, like, 50 times."
45,113,Lauren,We're already in incredibly tenuous ground.
45,114,Gretchen,"We just don't have data at that point. Maybe 50 times, maybe 70 or 80 times, because we also don't know how far we have to go back because speech and sign doesn't leave fossils. Not only do we not know how far we have to go back, we start multiplying very approximate numbers by each other and then we just keep doing so and the inaccuracies just keep compounding. I'm glad that this book got me into linguistics, but I'm also glad to leave it safely on the shelf as a memento. [Music]"

46,1,Lauren,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics! I'm Lauren Gawne."
46,2,Gretchen,"I'm Gretchen McCulloch. Today, we're getting enthusiastic about phatics, the parts of conversation that we use for their social meaning rather than their literal meaning. First, exciting book news! The paperback version of my book about internet language, Because Internet, is out in the world very, very shortly or possibly after if you're listening to this more than a few days after it came out."
46,3,Lauren,"If you've been thinking about buying Because Internet and you're like, 'I just need it to be cuter,' the paperback version is officially 200% cuter. It is so tiny and cute."
46,4,Gretchen,"Or if you're a person who likes to have the spines of books bend between your pages as you read them, I understand. You can now get that in paperback. This is a book all about various aspects of language on internet. We did a whole episode last year when it came out in hardback about various aspects of internet language when it comes to emoji. We'll be talking a bit more about internet-y things in this episode as well. If you like thinking about how we text and how we email and how we use memes and all of these types of things, or if you wanna know how other people are doing these things, this is a useful book for you."
46,5,Lauren,"You can still buy the hardback or listen to the audiobook if, for some reason, you are not into adorably cute, very bendable paperbacks."
46,6,Gretchen,"Yes. People have been saying very nice things to me about the audio recording, which I did myself, so if you like hearing my voice on this podcast and you would like to hear my voice for nine hours straight without any Lauren, you can also do that with the audiobook."
46,7,Lauren,"I should record a little backchannel track for people who just want to pretend it's an extended version of the podcast. 'Hm, that's interesting!'"
46,8,Gretchen,"Like a ten-second loop, 'Oh, how interesting!' so you can just stick it in wherever you want in the audiobook."
46,9,Lauren,'Yeah!' 'Ooo!' 'Ahh!' 'Uh huh.'
46,10,Gretchen,This sounds like a brilliant plan. We need to work on that.
46,11,Lauren,"Yes. This month's Patreon bonus episode is about music and language. It's our 41st bonus episode, which means you can get that and 40 other bonus episodes of the show, if you've listened to all of the main episodes, at patreon.com/lingthusiasm."
46,12,Gretchen,Lots more lingthusiastic content out there for you to enjoy. [Music]
46,13,Gretchen,"Hey, Lauren!"
46,14,Lauren,"Hey, Gretchen!"
46,15,Gretchen,How's it going?
46,16,Lauren,No bad. How are you?
46,17,Gretchen,Pretty good.
46,18,Lauren,It's nice weather today.
46,19,Gretchen,"Yeah, it's pretty hot here actually."
46,20,Lauren,"Ah, yeah, right. I forgot it's summer for you."
46,21,Gretchen,"Oh, right. You guys must have your sweaters out by now."
46,22,Lauren,It's a bit chilly in the morning.
46,23,Gretchen,"Yeah, well, okay."
46,24,Lauren,Yeah.
46,25,Gretchen,Yeah. All right.
46,26,Lauren,I better let you go.
46,27,Gretchen,Okay. Great to see you.
46,28,Lauren,Have a nice one.
46,29,Gretchen,"Yeah, you too."
46,30,Lauren,Bye!
46,31,Gretchen,Bye!
46,32,Lauren,See ya!
46,33,Gretchen,Bye!
46,34,Lauren,You hang up.
46,35,Gretchen,Click noise. Insert special effect here. I don't think we decided whether we were having an imaginary street-side conversation or an imaginary phone conversation because I feel like the beginning of that was imaginary street-side conversation and the end part of that was imaginary phone conversation.
46,36,Lauren,"The best thing about it was that was a conversation where we ostensibly didn't say anything meaningful, but we had a whole conversation."
46,37,Gretchen,It's a conversation that most people have probably had in some form or another. It's extremely familiar. It's very ritualised.
46,38,Lauren,"That's because the language that we use in greetings, in leave-taking, is something that is less about the literal content of what's being said and it's more about the social meaning of starting a conversation or ending a conversation or just acknowledging each other's presence by talking about the weather."
46,39,Gretchen,"Acknowledging the world -- it is a bit hard to talk about the weather over the internet, as we've discovered, because we don't necessarily have the same weather, which is the version that you have when you're meeting someone on the street. In many cases, it's less about the specific words that's being said and more about the social function of 'I'm acknowledging that you're here. We're having a ritualised exchange.' It's like doing a little social dance. We have a couple steps of a waltz, or a macarena, or whatever your dance of choice is, and then we move on with our day. It doesn't have to be a conversation that has a lot of content to it. We still have this acknowledgement of each other's presence."
46,40,Lauren,This dance-move ritual speaking is known as a type of speech called 'phatic' or 'phatic expressions.'
46,41,Gretchen,"'Phatic' is one of those great words that I find myself telling people about a lot because it's like everyone's encountered phatic expressions -- there's these things like 'How are you?' and 'Hello,' like the first thing you learn in a language class. Yet, the word 'phatic' itself -- it's P-H-A-T-I-C -- it's less familiar even though these things are so very familiar."
46,42,Lauren,"We're so used to these phatic interactions that until something jars with them, we don't often notice them. We can go through our day using many phatic greetings and leave-takings, but we don't always notice them until they maybe go off the rails or we're trying to do one set of dance moves and someone else is doing another."
46,43,Gretchen,"Especially, sometimes you get a phatic expression that starts changing -- it goes according to certain fads, I guess, not that kind of 'fad-tic.' One of these examples is with what you say in response to 'Thank you.'"
46,44,Lauren,"See, I always get in a little bit of trouble because my first reaction is always to be like, 'No worries.'"
46,45,Gretchen,"Right. That's the very Australian response, right?"
46,46,Lauren,"Yeah. In fact, someone was like, 'Well, you say 'You're welcome.'' It's just like, 'Ah.' Yeah, I guess that is an answer as well, but it's not my first, informal default."
46,47,Gretchen,I feel like 'You're welcome' is the version that shows up in the English language learning textbook not so much the version that I actually say on a regular basis.
46,48,Lauren,What do you normally reply to a 'Thanks' with?
46,49,Gretchen,"I think I would say, 'No problem,' maybe also 'No worries' sometimes. I think it's spread here. But 'No problem' is definitely one of the defaults for me. This can create some tension because if all of these are accomplishing the same thing -- they're the thing that you say in response to 'Thank you' -- they're all fitting in the same function socially. But because if you're used to one and you hear the other, you might interpret it more literally. That can sometimes make people start over-examining and questioning the individual words in that. 'What do you mean 'No problem'? Of course it's not a problem! What do you mean? Of course it's not a 'worry'!' Or like, 'Well, you are welcome. Are you not welcome?' People can get very caught up in the literal meaning of phatic expressions when something's undergoing a change, like changing from 'You're welcome' to 'No problem' to 'No worries' or these kinds of things and think that somebody, therefore, in this interaction must be doing something wrong, when it's really just the like, okay, language changes sometimes. This is one that's undergoing a particular change. People are using it phatically."
46,50,Lauren,"I think when everyone is joining in a square dance, you don't really notice that you're all seamlessly participating in the same dance. Then, if someone pulls some other moves, it can feel very disconcerting."
46,51,Gretchen,"It's like, oh, now I'm doing the chicken dance in the middle of the square dance."
46,52,Lauren,Yes.
46,53,Gretchen,"There is an interesting example of this that came up for me when I was in UK. I think I was specifically in Canterbury. I was going into various shops and, you know, people do -- like, you say 'Hello' when you go into the shop. People were saying to me, 'You all right?' And I was like, 'What do you mean? Is something wrong?' Because to me 'Are you all right?' is like 'Are you okay?' That's what you say to someone who's fallen down in the street and you need to know if you need to call an ambulance or something."
46,54,Lauren,Or you're just checking whether you're bleeding from the head or something.
46,55,Gretchen,"Right. Like, 'Are you gonna be able to get up by yourself or do you need some assistance from a passers-by?' Right?"
46,56,Lauren,"Oh, no. You were getting too sucked into the literal meaning. They were just saying, 'Hello. I'm starting this interaction.'"
46,57,Gretchen,"Exactly. They were really saying the equivalent of where I would say, 'How are you?' or 'How's it going?' Once I started going to the second and the third and the fourth shop, I started figuring this out. The first one I was like, 'What's going on?' But then you hear it again and you're like, 'It must be me. I am the outsider here.' Whereas, the inverse -- I think if you say, 'What's up?' to at least some British people, they interpret that as like, 'What's wrong?' The same passer-by fell down in the street and you're asking if they need assistance. Like, 'What's up?' some people interpret that way. Whereas, to me, it's just like, 'Oh, how's it going? What's up?' they all mean the same thing."
46,58,Lauren,I like when people get very distracted by what the 'it' is in 'How's it going?'
46,59,Gretchen,'How's what going?'
46,60,Lauren,Which in Australian English can be completely reduced to /haʊz gɑ̃/.
46,61,Gretchen,'How's goin'?'
46,62,Lauren,"Yeah. Just to show that it really is ritualised, you don't even need to clearly articulate it."
46,63,Gretchen,"I had this fun experiment that I would do in high school on my poor, unsuspecting classmates."
46,64,Lauren,I love a good Gretchen proto-linguist story.
46,65,Gretchen,"I've now memorialised this story in the pages of Because Internet because I was leading into discussing phatic expressions on the internet and I was like, 'Oh, I need an offline example, so I'll write this down.' So far, no one has contacted me about this. I don't know if they noticed at the time. What I would do is there was this thing that people would do which, you know, is possibly the case in any high school, I dunno, where you're walking down the hallways between classes and you see your friends who aren't in the same class as you. You're like, 'Hey, so-and-so, what's up?' 'Hey, what's up?' And you just keep going as you're passing each other in the hallway between one class and the next. I realised, because I was a budding linguist, that sometimes people would say, 'What's up?' 'Not much.' 'Nothing much.' Sometimes, people would say, 'How's it going?' 'Good. How are you?' These were accomplishing the same thing. I didn't know the word 'phatic expression,' but I was like, 'These are accomplishing the same thing.' So, what I did was if people said, 'What's up?' I would say, 'Good. How are you?' And if people said, 'How's it going?' I would say, 'Not much. What's up with you?'"
46,66,Lauren,I do like it when people do this unintentionally because they're both on autopilot for their own dance moves. I'm not surprised that you of all people decided to use this as an opportunity to try that out.
46,67,Gretchen,"Look, it's very typical. I will grant this."
46,68,Lauren,What was the response? What was the early data collection?
46,69,Gretchen,"The thing is, is like, people wouldn't notice. This is why I think no one from my high school has emailed me to be like, 'Hey, I read this thing in your book and I remember you doing this.' Because I just didn't say anything. As long as you do it without missing a beat and just kind of as if it's totally normal and natural to say, people don't notice because they're both accomplishing the same thing phatically. It's when you catch yourself and you're like, 'Oh, what's up? No. I mean, how's it going with you?' Then, people -- like, 'Oh, no! Something's broken' because they've recovered the literal meaning. But as long as you just treat it as a dance, it's kind of like when I was learning how to do swing dancing for a while. When I was learning how to do it, the most important thing was just to not stop. If you stopped and were like, 'Oh, no. Did I get that step right?' Whereas, you could just keep going and, even if the steps weren't perfect, you could figure it out."
46,70,Lauren,"This is basically me when it comes to dancing, yeah."
46,71,Gretchen,I feel like we should specify that we're not talking about the kind of dancing that you do when you're alone at home in your pyjamas and you're just rocking out in front of the computer. We're talking about the social dances that require you to take into account other people and how they exist and move together without people in some fashion.
46,72,Lauren,"As long as you move some limb on every beat of the macarena, you can pretend to be keeping up."
46,73,Gretchen,I wonder how much you could mess with the macarena and still have people think of it as a recognisable macarena. This sounds fun.
46,74,Lauren,I feel like high school corridor Gretchen would approve this experiment.
46,75,Gretchen,How badly can I misspell the YMCA dance? Just wondering.
46,76,Lauren,"Other than people mis-stepping or deliberately mis-stepping, the other time phatics can break down and people get a bit unable to navigate them is when the literal context breaks this ritualisation. If everyone's going through a bad patch at the same time, and you call someone up and you're like -- the default to start that conversation is 'How are you?' It's just like, there's also this second layer of the dance where you can all be like, 'Yeah, look. Fine, I guess,' where the tendency to just wanna say, 'Yeah, fine. How are you?' is at loggerheads with the fact that we all know we're going through a bad phase at the moment. It's like, 'Ugh.' But I also really appreciate that if you are going through a bad phase, it's still completely fine as part of the ritualised dance to be like, 'Yeah, I'm fine.' You don't actually have to engage with someone if you don't want to."
46,77,Gretchen,"Exactly. There are non-responses you can give, 'Not too bad' or 'Oh, well, it's a day' and just keep going with that, which means you don't have to give maybe strangers in a café or something this great insight into your interiority because you're not actually friends. You can just do the ritual dance and you have done the dance at the ritual level and it can be okay to stay there with other types of acquaintances."
46,78,Lauren,"The other time I really notice the ritualised nature of phatic expressions is when I'm learning a new language because they're often, like, Day 1 Chapter 1 of a textbook. You learn how to say 'Hello, how are you?' 'Good-bye. Have a nice day.' You also just have to use them a lot if you're speaking a language or if you have a good language teacher who makes you use these in every class. They often are also the things that stay in your brain the longest."
46,79,Gretchen,"They have that ritualised response -- it's like one person yawns and so you need to yawn. One person says, 'How are you?' and you can't help but reply, 'Good. How are you?' even if you're not thinking about it too hard."
46,80,Lauren,"Once you learn the steps to the dance in a particular culture or language, in Nepal, for example, instead of 'How are you?' or talking about the weather, the opening move of the dance is 'You eaten?' And you reply with, 'Yeah, I've eaten' or 'Haha, not yet.'"
46,81,Gretchen,That's great.
46,82,Lauren,"But until I really got the hang of it being a ritualised dance, I'd take it really literally and be like, 'Oh, well. I had breakfast a little while ago, but I'm not that hungry now, so maybe I'll eat later.' People would just be like, 'What is happening?'"
46,83,Gretchen,"'Why are you doing this?' Because of course you've eaten at some point in the past, but maybe it was too -- yeah."
46,84,Lauren,"They were just like -- I was just moving the conversation on. I am actually calling to ask you about going out this afternoon, and I'd been stuck on eating still."
46,85,Gretchen,"It's also funny. I've noticed this especially doing radio interviews for the book actually is because when you're on the radio, they want you to do a mic check. To do a mic check, they usually just talk for 30 seconds about anything. The standard question that they ask you is what you had for breakfast. They don't care what you had for breakfast. They don't care if it was healthy. They don't care if you just had coffee. They really don't care what you had for breakfast. They just need you to talk for 30 seconds. The first couple times I went into a radio station and they asked me what I had for breakfast, and I'd be like, 'Uh, you know, oh, did I have eggs or cereal this morning?' and really have to think about it very hard."
46,86,Lauren,They're just asking you a very function question and you are taking it way too literally. You're like me in Nepal.
46,87,Gretchen,Exactly. This is like the 'Have you eaten?' question in a couple different places that people can do this. I also noticed this in Montreal when I moved here because sometimes you learn a phatic expression in a textbook that's not actually the current phatic expression anymore or in a particular area.
46,88,Lauren,"'Ah, thank you.' 'You're welcome.'"
46,89,Gretchen,"Right. If you learned 'You're welcome' and then show up in an English-speaking area and everyone's saying, 'No problem' and 'No worries' and you're like, 'Oh, no! No one prepared me for this.' I remember shortly after I moved to Montreal, and I had learned my language textbook, like, the way you say, 'My name is' is 'je m'appelle Gretchen' or whatever."
46,90,Lauren,"Even as someone who speaks no functional French, I know that is how you say that in French."
46,91,Gretchen,"The literal translation of it is like, 'I call myself.' It's using the verb 'to be called' like an 'appellation.' Whereas, the vernacular way that people actually say this, at least in Montreal, is generally 'Moi c'est Gretchen.' This means literally 'Me, it's Gretchen.'"
46,92,Lauren,Translating these things literally never works well.
46,93,Gretchen,"Right! The literal translations never work particularly well. Completely different words, same social function. I remember I was at a crowded party or something. I think I might've actually been trying to swing dance."
46,94,Lauren,Excellent.
46,95,Gretchen,"It was a bit of a loud environment. And somebody gestured to themself and was like, 'Moi c'est' whatever this person's name was. I was like, 'What? What am I supposed to say to this? What do you want in response?' It was clearly this ritualised thing. Then, if you wanna ask someone else's name, you could say, 'toi,' like, 'you,' which, again, is not how I have learned to do this in the language learning classroom sense."
46,96,Lauren,"Oh, my gosh. You had to learn new dance steps and new social dance steps at the same time. What a champion."
46,97,Gretchen,I know! It's so poetic. What a metaphor we have going.
46,98,Lauren,"I love cross-cultural examples of phatics and ritualised speech. I'm actually very disappointed in the lack of examples on the Wikipedia page for these. If people want to share examples -- but even more excitingly, if you want to edit the Wikipedia page so there's more than English and then a couple of Japanese and Persian examples because there is a lot of cross-cultural variation."
46,99,Gretchen,"That's so public-spirited of you, Lauren. It's always really interesting to hear people's examples and it's very salient to you when you trip into something that's not the phatic expressions you're used to. The ones you are used to are so non-salient until something happens. It's a really fun area of stories in different languages or different cultural circumstances."
46,100,Lauren,"Another place I really enjoy people playing around with phatic expressions is in fiction, especially because we're both big sci fi and fantasy readers. Being set in different worlds or different times, it's such a great opportunity to play around with these rituals and create norms that are very different to ours."
46,101,Gretchen,"Absolutely. One example that I really like is from The Just City by Jo Walton, which is set in an ancient Greek-esque fantasy world where one of the characters is fictionalised Socrates. The characters all say to each other when they greet each other, 'Joy to you,' in English."
46,102,Lauren,"Oh, that's nice."
46,103,Gretchen,"Yeah. Which is this different greeting from, you know, 'Good morning,' 'Good night.' It very clearly has this function of a greeting and a farewell, I think, they also say when they're leaving. I asked Jo, because she's a Montrealer and I know her, if this is a translation of something. She was like, yeah, this is a translation of a greeting 'χαίρετε,' which gets used both in Homer and Plato and all the way up to Modern Greek that people used, sometimes translated as 'Rejoice' but also 'Joy to you' is a reasonable English translation."
46,104,Lauren,Cool. So bringing a set of phatic rituals from one culture and language into the fictionalised world as part of giving it a bit of an authentic flavour.
46,105,Gretchen,"Right. This explanation isn't in the text anywhere. You don't need to provide this additional context to a reader because they can figure out that the characters are arriving and leaving and greeting each other. It just helps emphasise it is a bit of a different world. Especially probably saying something like, 'Good-bye,' which in etymology is 'God be with you,' might strike you as kind of weird in this context where there is Athena and Apollo and not a god that is the form of the one that's the etymology of 'Good-bye.' It provides a useful little nugget of world building to have the phatic expressions also be different."
46,106,Lauren,"It's one of the things I really enjoyed about working with P. M. Freestone on the language construction for her Shadowscent duology is that she thought really hard about plausible in-world phatic expressions. So, the leave-taking ritual is 'Stars keep you,' which is related to the star wheels, which are related to destiny but also navigation and a few spoiler-y plot points that I won't mention from those books. It's just one of the little things that really situates you in a world outside of our own. I always really appreciate that."
46,107,Gretchen,It's that extra thing that indicates something in the book. There's also the classic 'May the force be with you' Star Wars leave-taking expression.
46,108,Lauren,Which always rubs up against the phatic expression of 'And also with you' from Catholic church excursions in my childhood.
46,109,Gretchen,"Yeah. I definitely had enough exposure to this that I am like, 'And also with you?'"
46,110,Lauren,"It's like, oh no, we're mixing up two dances here."
46,111,Gretchen,"I think that speaks to the power of the phatic expression as a dance that often has a call and response or a first part/second part -- or multipart -- thing where you do have this impetus to respond in a particular way, the same way if someone just lets 'How are you?' hang. You're like, 'No, no, no. I need to resolve that.'"
46,112,Lauren,I've actually been very pleased in my elaborate multi-year Star Trek television-watching deep dive that I've been on to discover the response to 'Live long and prosper' is 'Peace and long life.'
46,113,Gretchen,"Oh, that's very nice. I know the first part but not the second part."
46,114,Lauren,"Yeah. I mean, you can just reply with the gesture. You can reply by repeating. But there is actually a call and response option there which really fits with that phatics as dances where you're both making moves."
46,115,Gretchen,"There's the new world-building task of make a two-part phatic construction. It's not just phatics in face-to-face communication. It's also there are written phatics. One of my favourite kinds are these letter-writing conventions where you have these very elaborate greetings and farewells. This is not as common in the modern-day email. There's this great example of that in the musical Hamilton where in the archival records between these two characters -- well, real people, I guess -- they have exchanged a bunch of letters that culminate in them fighting a duel. But they sign each of these letters, that are clearly very angry because it ends in a duel, with 'Your obedient servant' even though they're really annoyed at each other."
46,116,Lauren,I feel like that is an even more extreme version of the saying that you're fine when you're not fine.
46,117,Gretchen,"Right! Clearly, you're not an obedient servant. This irony is so noticeable to the modern reader that there's a song in the musical about them fighting the duel which has as the chorus the obedient servant part because the dramatic irony is just too tempting for a modern reader. Although, back in the day, it's not particularly ironic because this was just a stock phrase."
46,118,Lauren,They were just signing off their letters as they were taught.
46,119,Gretchen,"That's just what you put. That's kind of like saying, 'Sincerely.' Sometimes, you can send someone a really nasty letter and still say 'Sincerely' and you're like, 'Ha ha ha! I hate you but sincerely.'"
46,120,Lauren,"Yes. I feel like we maybe are more attuned to the dissonance in writing because we, just like with writing as a practice itself, have to learn it very overtly, often at school. I still remember having lessons in how to set out a letter. There is a lot about learning phatics that happens throughout your childhood years, which I find interesting because we tend to think about language learning as this thing you get out of the way by the time you've gone to school. You can speak but learning the more elaborate dances of these phatic turn-taking expression dances, we do it our whole life as we move through different places where we need to practice them."
46,121,Gretchen,There's this really brilliant example of this from Winnie the Pooh.
46,122,Lauren,"Oh, excellent."
46,123,Gretchen,"Which, I think, children's literature often illustrates this literalness because adults find it very funny. It goes, ''And how are you?' said Winnie the Pooh. Eeyore shook his head from side to side. 'Not very how,' he said, 'I don't seem to have felt at all how for a long time.' 'Dear, dear,' said Pooh, 'I'm sorry about that. Let's have a look at you.''"
46,124,Lauren,"Oh, bless poor old Eeyore."
46,125,Gretchen,Poor Eeyore.
46,126,Lauren,"Poor Eeyore not feeling very well and not realising that he was just meant to say, 'Fine. How are you?'"
46,127,Gretchen,"Or even, 'Not so great,' but -- there're ways to say, 'Not so how,' but it's not the 'How are you?' 'I'm not how at all.' Or 'How are you?' 'How do I what?' which was one of my favourites as a kid."
46,128,Lauren,"That's a good one. In Nepali, one of the informal ways, instead of saying, 'Have you eaten?' is to just say, 'How's it?' I definitely need to say, 'Tik chha.' I definitely like, the first many times that was said to me, was just like, 'How's what? What am I meant to be replying about? I don't even know what I'm meant to be talking about let alone how it is.' I feel for Eeyore on many levels there."
46,129,Gretchen,"I think 'How do you do' is a really good example of one that's gotten older and become more deprecated. I wouldn't expect anyone to say that now. I had one teacher in school that would say, 'How art?' whenever he would see us in the hallway. It was just the thing that he said."
46,130,Lauren,That is the person who still practices Medieval court dances while we're all doing the macarena.
46,131,Gretchen,"This is like, yeah, you're doing a different dance, but it was still very clear in context, right?"
46,132,Lauren,That is an adorable affectation.
46,133,Gretchen,"Sometimes, I say, 'how goes' and I don't know where I got it, but people seem to understand it. Maybe it is a semi-literal translation from French because in French 'ça va' is like 'goes it' or 'it goes.' I think another part of the child language acquisition bit that happens at an older age is also acquiring things like phone scripts like, what do you say when you're on the phone? Because it's not quite the same as when you're greeting someone in person."
46,134,Lauren,"Oh, my gosh. I used to hate the phone. My mom used to -- I remember being overtly coached by my mom in what I should say, and she was like, 'And then the person will say, 'Hi, this is blah. Is your mom there?'' I just used to be like, 'Okay. Are you sure they're gonna say that?' I just hadn't got the dance moves down pat and it felt like a lot more effort. My mom was like, 'I already know exactly how this phone call's gonna go. It's fine.'"
46,135,Gretchen,"I find as a kid I really hated trying to pick up the phone, too. Even as a young teenager I really hated picking up the phone, especially once I sounded old enough that people thought I might be my mom, but I still clearly wasn't. Now, as an adult, I find myself using the scripts that I overheard my parents use. If I need to spell my surname over the phone, I spell it the same way my mom spelled it in the same groups -- M-C-C, U-L-L, O-C-H. You pick up those ritualised bits of conversations. It's easier for me to do it as an adult because I'm able to just directly access the adult rituals rather than try to do this weird child-mediated ritual of like, 'Is your mom there?' I never heard my parents do that half of the conversation."
46,136,Lauren,"You'll be shocked to know that once I got the phone script down pat, I used to enjoy messing with it."
46,137,Gretchen,[Laughs] Of course you did!
46,138,Lauren,"Which used to happen a lot because, as I've probably talked about in the naming episodes, both of my parents are called 'Chris' for short. So, people would be like, 'Hi, is Chris Gawne there?' And the only acceptable moves usually are, 'Yes, I'll get him for you' or 'No, he's not in at the moment. Can I take a message?' No one expects the, 'Which one?'"
46,139,Gretchen,"Because, especially if they only know one of your parents, I guess then they think they know unambiguously who they're asking for."
46,140,Lauren,"Very satisfying. Once you get comfortable with the script, the power that it allows you to have is very satisfying."
46,141,Gretchen,"One of the things that I was fascinated to find when I was diving into the research on this for Because Internet is that when the phone was introduced as a piece of technology, this didn't just stress like you and I and probably a lot of people out as kids, this stressed out the whole society."
46,142,Lauren,That is actually really reassuring.
46,143,Gretchen,"Right? People were really unsure about what you should say when you pick up a phone because how do you say, 'Good morning' if you don't know if it's morning where they are or, like, I dunno. There were a couple options that were proposed for things that one could say on answering the phone."
46,144,Lauren,Was one of them 'Hello'?
46,145,Gretchen,One of them was 'Hello.'
46,146,Lauren,Okay. Good.
46,147,Gretchen,One of them was 'Ahoy hoy.'
46,148,Lauren,"Oh, Gretchen, we have squandered an opportunity that was presented to us as a society."
46,149,Gretchen,"The thing is, is that now 'Hello' is this general-purpose greeting, but it wasn't at the time. It was a thing you said, like, 'Hallo' to summon dogs and stuff."
46,150,Lauren,Oh.
46,151,Gretchen,'Hello' was not a greeting at the time.
46,152,Lauren,"Right. It's not like they were just like, 'Well, we'll take this thing we use face-to-face and use it on the telephone.'"
46,153,Gretchen,"No, no, no. This was like, 'We're gonna invent this new greeting.'"
46,154,Lauren,Ah.
46,155,Gretchen,"For a while it was like this telephone thing that one said and people who said 'Hello' face-to-face were a little bit gauche. It's kind of like some people get worried now if people say 'LOL' or 'OMG' face-to-face, and you're like, 'I don't know. That's an internet thing. Can you actually say that out loud?' Then it was like, 'But you're saying 'Hello' and you're not on the telephone.'"
46,156,Lauren,'Ahoy hoy.'
46,157,Gretchen,'Ahoy hoy.' Another suggestion which I'm pretty glad this one didn't catch on was 'What is wanted.'
46,158,Lauren,"Oh, that sounds very -- that is a very aggressive first move."
46,159,Gretchen,It's very abrupt. One of the suggestions for what you said when you finished your phone conversation was just 'That is all.'
46,160,Lauren,And just hang up?
46,161,Gretchen,Just hang up.
46,162,Lauren,"I mean, I think it would've been better for everyone to stop us from the endless good-bye loops if we had just, as a society, accepted that that was the phatic conclusion."
46,163,Gretchen,"Well, I think there's actually something really useful about those good-bye loops though because when you say good-bye to someone in person, you get to watch them pull away from you, if necessary, you know, very Mr. Darcy-esque like, oh no, I'm gonna watch them pull away from me. You have this gradual leaving. Whereas, when you hang up the phone or when you hang up a video call for that matter, the rupture is very final. You hang up and then it's over. You need more steps to have happen so that you don't just feel like, 'Well, that's over and that's done.' You need a longer turn-taking or leave-taking process. I think about the same thing doing video calls where you have a whole group of video-called people. Everyone's waving at each other as you're leaving. That's kinda that signal, when everyone's doing the wave in the video, that now you can click on the X and you won't be missing anything because you've all synced up on the waves, which is a lot easier to do in the video space than it is in audio only."
46,164,Lauren,"For sure. The anxiety about phone greetings reminds me a lot of the almost annual put it in your calendar discussion about anxieties over how to start and end emails. As a society, we still haven't collectively agreed on a 'Hello' equivalent."
46,165,Gretchen,"Yeah. There's several and it depends on which subculture you're in. It's interesting because in text messages the norm is very much in the other direction. You often don't begin a text message or a chat or something with like, 'Hey, how are you?' I think people often view if you just send someone an instant message or a chat message, some of them it's like, 'Hey, how's it going?' without any indication of what you want from them. It's sort of weird. If you're gonna start a conversation with someone in chat, you have the responsibility to introduce a topic because that way they know what they're getting into when they send that first reply. They can judge if they have time to respond. It's more like, 'Hey, just have this question about this thing' or 'I just saw this link and I thought you might like it.' Then, the person knows when they start replying what kind of conversation they're trying to enter into. But in email, it's the inverse. You get this sort of, people making fun of grandparents texting of like, 'Hi, so-and-so. How's it going? Here's this thing. Love, Grandma and Grandpa' in the text message. Whereas, in email, the inverse is the case where you do wanna have these greetings and people who don't send the greetings, sometimes they're the ones that occasion angst or which greetings you pick occasion a lot of angst."
46,166,Lauren,I think we should go back to 'Your obedient servant.'
46,167,Gretchen,"One of the examples that I actually had in Because Internet of these elaborate phatic expressions in letters was, 'To the right noble and valorous Sir Walter Raleigh' from this letter from Edmund Spenser. I cited this as an example of like, nobody does this anymore. Then, there was a class who was reading the book as part of their internet linguistics/digital media communications class, and one of the students sent their professor an email with 'To the right noble and valorous Professor so-and-so' because of the book. I was just so pleased about this. They told me about it. I was just so delighted. Maybe we should go back to this. It's also one of these cases where as long as someone isn't actually sending you a nasty email where they call you nasty names, which is definitely they're definitely trying to be very rude if they're doing that, but if the case is like, 'Is this person using a comma or not?' 'Is this person using 'Hi' or 'Hey' or 'Dear' or something,' like everyone here is trying to be polite. Those are all things that people are trying to be polite or someone is signing off like, 'I hope you're well' or 'Hope you're bearing up' like, 'Hope you're doing as well as possible under the circumstances.' There're all these different variants that one can use and they're all trying to be polite. I think that thinking of them as part of the unified class of phatic expressions can help us relax a little bit about trying to read too much into the messages that we're getting or getting really worried about the messages that we're sending other people because it's a reflection that, ultimately, everyone's trying."
46,168,Lauren,"I really like thinking about phatics as this more abstract attempt at a cultural dance because it makes me far more relaxed about when these friction points happen, and people maybe don't use the forms you expect. It allows me to reflect on my own choices and how I am maybe doing social politeness. It also just makes me really satisfied when you and someone else get all the dance moves right in a little interaction in a shop and you can think about it more in terms of the social interaction it's achieving rather than the specific steps that you're taking."
46,169,Gretchen,"I think this is one of the things that attracts a lot of people to linguistics is having this stuff of like, 'Oh, here's this thing I took for granted that I haven't thought about and here's actually what's going on' or 'Here's this overt description of what I'm doing' and this can make it easier to do the dance and not worry that, oh, maybe it's inauthentic because the authenticity is doing the dance. We're participating in a particular dance, and you're seeing someone who's doing this dance, and there's still space to have the deep heart-to-heart conversations. But not all the conversations that we have need to be that heart-to-heart. There's a space for both kinds of interactions. [Music]"

47,9,Gretchen,"Lauren, I have a game for you."
47,10,Lauren,I love games.
47,11,Gretchen,I'm gonna give you a word and then you say whatever word you think of quickly after that.
47,12,Lauren,Okay.
47,13,Gretchen,Let's start with 'red.'
47,14,Lauren,Blue.
47,15,Gretchen,Big.
47,16,Lauren,Small.
47,17,Gretchen,Fast.
47,18,Lauren,Slow.
47,19,Gretchen,Loud.
47,20,Lauren,Quiet.
47,21,Gretchen,Online.
47,22,Lauren,Offline?
47,23,Gretchen,Afloat.
47,24,Lauren,'Asink'? What is the opposite of -- I don't know what the opposite of 'afloat' is.
47,25,Gretchen,"'On shore,' 'on board,' I dunno."
47,26,Lauren,Sure.
47,27,Gretchen,I didn't think through that one very deeply.
47,28,Lauren,I've been doing so many of these in children's picture books at the moment. It's always a great delight.
47,29,Gretchen,"These words are -- or at least mostly, with the exception of 'asink,' perhaps -- these words are mostly adjectives, which is the kind of word that you may have learned if you played Mad Libs as a hobby like I did growing up -- is a word that describes things."
47,30,Lauren,I feel like that's a good start for what an adjective is in terms of you just need a pithy definition. But I feel like these words all have more things in common than just that.
47,31,Gretchen,"The thing that I find really interesting about adjectives as a category is that they're one of those categories that seems like it gets passed down to us from the descriptive grammatical tradition. When you start looking at it more closely, it breaks apart really quickly. There are more differences and more similarities in other types of categories. It really starts to make you question the notion of parts of speech. When linguists talk about diagnostics for adjectives, in English, sometimes we diagnose adjectives by saying, okay, you can add endings like '-er' or '-est' on them or use words like 'more' and 'most' with them to make comparatives and superlatives. You can have something be 'redder' or 'bluest' or 'bigger' or 'smallest,' 'louder,' or 'quieter.' It doesn't always work though."
47,32,Lauren,"'More online,' 'most online.'"
47,33,Gretchen,"Fair enough. 'More afloat,' 'less afloat,' 'afloater.' Adjectives are words that they have this descriptive property, but they also have this morphosyntactic property that they can be compared to degrees like other adjectives."
47,34,Lauren,"Once you start realising this is something that adjectives do consistently in English, but other word classes don't, these '-er' and '-est' suffixes can be used to figure out what isn't an adjective as well."
47,35,Gretchen,"If we have a word like 'dog,' and I don't think there is 'This dog is 'dogger' than this other dog.' 'This is the 'doggest' dog.'"
47,36,Lauren,"Definitely not in standard English. I think it's a great example of how we can be playful, but I don't think it would come off as a very standard form. Or we wouldn't have like, 'You are more 'danciest.''"
47,37,Gretchen,'The 'dancest.''
47,38,Lauren,'You are the most 'dance'' doesn't work because --
47,39,Gretchen,"I mean, you can be a 'dancer,' but that doesn't make you more 'dance' than the other person if you're a dancer. That's a different kind of '-er.'"
47,40,Lauren,"You're a dancer, but I'm the 'dancest.'"
47,41,Gretchen,"That sounds like an invitation to a dance off! Yes, I mean, you can do these, but they very clearly have this playful quality that 'fast/faster' is just like, yep, you can do that. Whereas, 'dancer' or 'dancest' has this playful quality that you can do it if you wanna have a bit of fun, but it's not something that's already part of the canon of things that people typically say in English."
47,42,Lauren,"This is why we refer to them as diagnostics in the way that we take a temperature on a person to see if they have a fever, we can use these morphemes to test whether a word is an adjective in English or not."
47,43,Gretchen,"Or to have the weird fun of making something into a different lexical category than it had previously belonged to. If I wanna say, 'Oh, this thing is 'funner,'' like, hey, that's a bit of fun you can have with lexical conversion."
47,44,Lauren,Are lexical conversations the 'funnest' thing you can do? I think so.
47,45,Gretchen,"They are the 'funnest.' There are other ways of doing this. That's a test you can do with putting endings on the word, and you can also do tests by what kinds of sentences you can put it in. If you have something like, 'the red car' or 'the big car,' then if you wanna test, oh, does 'dance' work in there -- 'the dance car.' Kind of? Again, it sounds like maybe you're having a bit of fun with the language. Or 'the dog car' -- it's an interesting example because if you take a word like 'the doghouse,' right, 'dog' is clearly describing 'house' there. I think that's one of the issues that confuses people when you're talking about adjectives because you can use other kinds of words to describe something or to modify something like 'doghouse' or 'dance' -- I feel like a 'dance car' -- I dunno, there's a 'party bus.'"
47,46,Lauren,The dance car is the budget version for when you only have a couple of friends.
47,47,Gretchen,"Or maybe it's a car that can dance itself. You can be a 'partier,' but you don't have a 'partiest,' like, 'This is the 'partiest' bus,' 'This is the 'dancest' car.' It can let us do these diagnostics language-internally and figure out here's what's going on in English, here's what's going on with this particular word. Where, if we wanna try to force it into the mould of being really adjective-y, then we can do it, but it's very clearly playful. Whereas, if we make this one into a very adjective-y mould, it's like, yep, okay, lots of people are already doing that."
47,48,Lauren,"We've been using the '-er' comparative and the '-est' superlative suffixes to tell if something is an adjective, but we can also use a negative diagnostic to check if something is definitely not one of the other word categories."
47,49,Gretchen,"Right. If you have a word like 'party' or 'cake,' which we know is a noun, one of the things that nouns can do is nouns can become plural. You have 'cakes,' you have 'parties' -- this sounds like a great afternoon. I'm having the party cake."
47,50,Lauren,But you can't have 'bigs.' You can't use the plural on an adjective.
47,51,Gretchen,"Right. 'Bigs' and 'smalls' and 'reds.' If you do, it's kind of because you're actually treating this adjective as a noun. Sometimes that means -- so if I'm doing laundry, I can be like, 'Oh, I'm gonna put the reds in this pile and the blues in that pile.' Now, I've taken these words that are traditionally adjectives and I've converted them into nouns, which is something that people do pretty regularly. This isn't as playful because people have already done it. And, oh, now I'm actually using this adjective as a noun. English is a language that's very prone to bringing words to cross over into other lexical categories. Many other languages also do this. It's something that we miss when we talk about, 'Oh, 'red.' It's an adjective,' because you can sometimes use it as a noun. If you talk about like, 'I'm gonna wash all the reds together,' you're using it as a noun there. It's not that 'red' is always an adjective, it's most canonical form is an adjective in the same way that you can make 'This is the 'partiest' bus I've ever seen.' If you wanna make that into an adjective, you can."
47,52,Lauren,"I used to get very anxious about this because I liked just being like 'These words are adjectives and these words are nouns.' Once I got comfortable with the diagnostic approach of just looking what a word is doing in the particular context it's being said, it's actually a lot more liberating and relaxing to be like, 'I will just accept this word on the terms that it arrives at me.' I can look at where it is in the word order because that's important for English. I can also look at what suffixes it has because that's also useful for English. I can use these criteria every time. I don't have to remember a list of what's an adjective and what's a noun and what's a verb. I can just use these criteria that I know when I come across an example."
47,53,Gretchen,"I think it's one of the things that distinguishes a linguistic approach to grammar from a 'I'm taking this high school English class' approach to grammar because I definitely remember being taught, okay, if you wanna know if something's an adjective, you can look it up in the dictionary, and the dictionary will tell you. This, of course, raises the very obvious question of, 'Well, how did the dictionary makers know that this was an adjective? Who decided that?' Dictionaries are great. I'm not anti-dictionary. But if you're always looking for external authorities for something that you can actually logic out for its principles, it's unsatisfying. Whereas, being able to actually deduce, 'Oh, I know this is an adjective because I've run it through these tests,' let's you feel like you're figuring something out about that world. It's the appeal of doing a logic puzzle as opposed to being told like, 'Here's what the sudoku looks like. If you wanna know what the correct answer is to the Sudoku, you just look it up.' It's like, well, you could actually just do the sudoku and then you could figure it out. That's more fun than looking up the answer to the sudoku."
47,54,Lauren,Yeah. I enjoy being a part of speech detective and figuring out what a word is doing in a sentence using the linguistic evidence that I have.
47,55,Gretchen,"Similarly, we have existing diagnostics around verbs. Verbs in English, when they're in the third person singular, often have this other S ending that's not plural. If I say something like, 'She bigs' or 'She reds' or 'She blues,' this is very clearly being jocular with language almost to the point of incoherence because I'm not quite sure what any of those mean."
47,56,Lauren,"I guess you could say, 'She bigs herself up' and in that complex structure it's the 'big' that takes the plural?"
47,57,Gretchen,"Totally. I mean, I don't know if that's an idiom that I have but, when you say, I'm like, 'Oh, yeah. Sure.'"
47,58,Lauren,"I'll accept that. It's these edge cases -- every time you're like, 'I figured out what this category is,' and then you find these edge cases, and then you find the edge cases to the edge cases, and then someone will have written their whole PhD dissertation on an edge case of the edge case, but that is what makes language so fun to play with."
47,59,Gretchen,"Absolutely. I think if I wanted to make these colour terms into verbs, I'd really wanna add a suffix at that point. 'I'm gonna 'redden' my shirts by washing them in with the reds.' Sometimes, we just make something into a different part of speech by treating it as if it is, and then it is that way. Then, sometimes we add a suffix, or we add something else to it that makes that conversion happen. Maybe it's because 'redden' exists that it's difficult to say like, 'I 'red' the shirt by washing it with the reds.'"
47,60,Lauren,"Once you realise how effective this adding suffix morphemes to words to create new words and new word categories is, you're like, 'Ah, this is how English has 100,000 or 200,000 words,' or whatever people say. Because any noun, if you are a creative enough English speaker, can be adjectivised with the right amount of creative use of the resources that you already have."
47,61,Gretchen,"Yeah. I mean, I just said the 'really adjective-y adjectives,' which makes 'adjective,' which is itself a noun, into an adjective. Or it can be 'adjectivised,' which then makes it into a verb."
47,62,Lauren,Then we can talk about the 'adjectivisation' of nouns.
47,63,Gretchen,"Right. We could talk about 'adjectival,' which is the adjective of 'adjective.'"
47,64,Lauren,Yes.
47,65,Gretchen,"Or the adjectival form of 'adjective' if you will. I think we're really rapidly approaching the place where 'adjective' doesn't actually feel like it means anything anymore, just in the sense of we've been saying the sounds /æ/ /d͡ʒ/ /dɪk/ /tɪv/ too many times in a row."
47,66,Lauren,"I'm really grateful that we have the diagnostic criteria to know that it does actually mean something in English as a category. This is where your native speaker intuitions or finding a speaker of a language to consult their intuitions is really important because, as we've already said, there's a difference between forms that we recognise as people regularly using and ones that we're just making up for creativity sake for this episode. There are lots of other intuitions that people have about categories like adjectives that they may not have consciously ever reflected on. I think the order of adjectives is definitely one of those things."
47,67,Gretchen,Ooo! Is this the 'big red car' versus 'red big car' thing?
47,68,Lauren,"Yes. I think of it as the 'iced tea' phenomenon, personally."
47,69,Gretchen,I could go for some iced tea right now.
47,70,Lauren,"Sure. If you would like a flavour of iced tea, what type of iced tea would you like?"
47,71,Gretchen,I dunno. Maybe I'll take a lemon iced tea.
47,72,Lauren,"I always used to order lemon iced tea in Singapore. It took quite a while, while I was living there, is realise that I was in this weird negotiation with people because I would order a lemon iced tea and they would say, 'Yes, one iced lemon tea for you.' 'Lemon iced tea' is the phrase that I am used to. It took a long time for me to actually remember to order an 'iced lemon tea.' I figured out it was because, for me, 'iced tea' was the genre. That's the minimal unit. Then, I would add 'lemon' as a second adjective to modify that because I could have lemon iced tea or peach iced tea or any other delicious flavour of iced tea."
47,73,Gretchen,Mango iced tea or something.
47,74,Lauren,"Whereas, for Singaporeans, it was the fact that it was lemon tea or milk tea or black tea --"
47,75,Gretchen,"Yeah, okay, and then you could have hot milk tea or cold milk tea, hot lemon tea or iced lemon tea."
47,76,Lauren,"Mm-hmm. In this case, the adjective order was dependent on what we thought we were modifying to begin with."
47,77,Gretchen,"That's really neat. There's this meme that circulates the internet every so often pointing out that people say 'the big red balloon' or the 'the four big red balloons' or 'the four big old round red rubber toy balloons,' and this sounds like a lot of description to go to when I'm talking about balloons, but it sounds unremarkable to you. Whereas, if you put it in another order like, 'the toy rubber red round big four old balloons' --"
47,78,Lauren,I can actually feel you pause and mentally process that.
47,79,Gretchen,"The ironic thing is, is I'm reading it out loud and yet it's still so difficult to say out loud from a page. Because there're certain conventions about orders that people put adjectives in, and you don't even think about this because you just do it instinctively. It seems to often work fairly similarly across languages, which is kind of interesting."
47,80,Lauren,"Even now that we've just figured out what adjectives are, there're actually sub-categories within adjectives. Are they describing different properties of something? Is that where they come from?"
47,81,Gretchen,"Yeah. For example, people tend to put size before colour -- that's your 'big red' thing. Or objective or subjective opinion can sometimes go -- it can go in a couple different places. You have 'big bad wolf,' not 'bad big wolf.'"
47,82,Lauren,"But maybe there's a bad small wolf, just to go back to the lemon iced tea situation."
47,83,Gretchen,"Well, and that's the thing. There is some sense in which there's a bit of a default order, but there's also a sense in which 'the bad big wolf' and 'the good big wolf' -- you could use that order if you wanted to have a direct contrast there. So, in addition to the fact that, hey, the order you put adjectives in is actually more regular and more complicated than you thought about it -- there's revelation Number 1 -- revelation Number 2 is, you can break it still. You can do other things with it than this pattern you didn't realise you were following. You can follow this second pattern you also didn't realise you were following."
47,84,Lauren,It's adjective awareness all the way down.
47,85,Gretchen,"Yes. One version of this order that people have described is: quantity; objective/subjective opinion; size; age; shape; colour; quote-unquote 'real' adjectives or adjectives not otherwise specified; and purpose. That's something like 'rubber' for the adjective not otherwise specified -- material, maybe -- purpose, something like a toy. That is one order you could come up with. It words fairly well if you're just substituting 'red' and 'blue' with each other, or 'old' and 'young' with each other, in respect to these kinds of things. You can keep stacking adjectives and see which orders break. Of course, sometimes, if you put 'good' in there, it's not necessarily gonna work the same way as 'high-quality,' even though those are both opinions. You can start creating a really elaborate taxonomy of adjective orders, and you can kind of get somewhere, but you're also like, 'Where am I even going?'"
47,86,Lauren,"Obviously, intuition is part of this because we found it easier to process one order than the other, but linguists also draw on corpora. People will look at how adjectives have been ordered in speech to look at which ones people prefer to go before or after. It's actually incredibly rare to get seven adjectives. It's really rare for people to describe a balloon in that much detail."
47,87,Gretchen,"Well, and it's interesting that we have intuitions about how these seven adjectives can be ordered even though it's very rare that we actually say seven adjectives in a row like that. That's kind of neat. In languages, languages like French, which often puts the adjectives after the noun, you may get the same order but in the inverse. The order is based on what's closest to the noun not the linear left to right order or first to last order. It can be based on what's closest to the noun and build outwards in the other direction. Although, French has this interesting complication which is that some of its adjectives, 'big' and 'small' -- 'grande,' 'petite' -- tend to go before the nouns, whereas most of its adjectives go after. You have this interesting intersection there."
47,88,Lauren,Our English diagnostic criteria for adjectives going before a noun is not gonna work as neatly for French.
47,89,Gretchen,"Right. One of the things that you learn in French class is like, 'Oh, there're these two classes of adjectives. There's the class that goes before the noun and the class that goes after.'"
47,90,Lauren,Cool.
47,91,Gretchen,"Or, for some of them, if you put this adjective that conventionally goes before the noun and sometimes it goes after, it means something slightly different when it goes after. Maybe it means something a little bit more literal or something. The question of which part of speech categories are the categories that we actually should use and which ones are just spurious differences that don't really matter because it's not part of the real categories -- it turns into this giant can of worms when you start opening it. Because, in French, we could say, 'Oh, well, we have adjectives. Adjectives are adjectives. Surely there are adjectives, right?' But then why not, in French, have two different categories of these modifiers that go before the noun versus these modifiers that go after the noun? Why unify them both under 'adjectives'? They don't behave the same way."
47,92,Lauren,Do they behave the same way in other ways?
47,93,Gretchen,"They do behave the same way in other contexts. You can describe them with comparatives and superlatives kind of like you can in English. It's not a suffix. It's a different word like 'more.' But one of the key things is that they agree in gender and number with the nouns that they modify. If you talk about 'a blue car' versus 'blue cars,' you're gonna put that extra S silently -- in the writing, but not necessarily in speech -- on the word 'blue' as well as the word 'car.'"
47,94,Lauren,Okay.
47,95,Gretchen,"This is much easier to see in a language like Latin, which actually pronounces these differences, versus French where it's kind of fossilised and maybe fake -- I dunno, it depends on who you ask -- because it's mostly there in the writing at this point. In Latin, it's definitely very actively there in the actual speech. It's actually still pronounced. In Latin, any sort of ending change that you do on the nouns -- if you make it plural, if you make it possessive, if you make it the subject or the object of the sentence -- all of these types of changes that you could do to the noun you have to do with whatever adjectives it goes with. The big way that you can tell that something is an adjective is because it's doing all this stuff to match its noun. If you read Latin poetry, you can see the noun and the adjective can be split apart on different lines, and you can tell that they go with each other because they have matching endings."
47,96,Lauren,"It's really cool that adjectives have a noun-y property in French because there's a language in Nepal called Manange where some of the adjectives have a verb-y vibe rather than a noun-y vibe. I know about this because in a grammatical description by my colleague and collaborator Kristine Hildebrandt, she talks about -- they have this really small set of adjectives that behave more like adjectives as we think of them in English, but then they also have this set that they come from verbs. You can see how they're related."
47,97,Gretchen,"An English version of that might be if I say like, 'The cat is running,' I could also talk about 'the running cat' or 'the walking cat,' where 'run' and 'walk' are canonically verbs, but you can also use them in an adjective-y sort of way. You don't get to talk about 'the 'runningest' cat' or 'the 'walkinger' cat.' You kind of could."
47,98,Lauren,"You can talk about the 'more cooked cake' -- 'Mine turned under baked, but yours is more cooked.' But, anyway, you absolutely couldn't use the 'Look at if the adjective is doing noun-y things' criteria that's very important for French. You can't use that for Manange. You have to look at how they relate to the verbs instead."
47,99,Gretchen,"Well, and it's interesting because, doing the research for this episode and looking at Latin in a bit more detail, it turns out that Latin grammarians actually didn't distinguish in the same way between nouns and adjectives at all. They talked about this broader category of 'nomin' or 'names' of which both nouns and adjectives were sub-categories. You had your substantive nouns and your adjectival nouns. These are both sub-categories of the general categories of nouns. Then verbs was its whole other thing. In some respects, I like to think of them as 'adje-verbs' and 'adje-nouns.' You have your adjectives that work like verbs do and your adjectives that work like nouns do. This is true of Algonquian languages as well is you have in these languages 'to be red' or 'to be big' is a verb. Instead of saying, 'This house is big,' you say, essentially, 'The house bigs' or 'The house reds,' and that means, 'It is big' or 'It is red.' It's all one word."
47,100,Lauren,"Cool. That's very verb, as opposed to the Manange which are kind of verb-y."
47,101,Gretchen,"Yeah. They conjugate like verbs. The verbs get different types of endings and so on. They really act like verbs. Whereas, the nouns do a different thing. They have the endings like verbs do. It's interesting to see -- okay, the idea that adjectives exist. You can find evidence in English that they're distinct from both verbs and nouns. They can do different types of things. But depending on the language, something that means essentially the same thing -- like 'red' or 'big' or something which seems very descriptive-y -- can, in some languages, have formal properties that makes it more like a verb, and then other languages have formal properties that makes it look like a noun, or neither of the above. I went and looked at the book Describing Morphosyntax, which is a book that tries to do a --"
47,102,Lauren,Here's all the possibilities.
47,103,Gretchen,"Yeah. It's a book that tries to catalogue the possibilities for what languages can do, which of course is biased towards which languages have been previously described, but it does give you a bit of a picture of what some languages do at least. They actually break down five different types of ways you could treat adjectives."
47,104,Lauren,"Okay. Here are five common ways, if we look across the world's languages, adjectives tend to exist."
47,105,Gretchen,Right. They call them 'property concepts' because it's not clear that all of them are actually adjectives.
47,106,Lauren,Okay.
47,107,Gretchen,We've talked about three of them already. One is property concepts could be verbs. The second is property concepts could be nouns. The fifth is there's a distinct class of adjectives for property concepts.
47,108,Lauren,"I love that's the fifth. The thing that we think of as the most obvious is like, 'Oh, and also this thing.'"
47,109,Gretchen,"The other two are -- sometimes property concepts are treated as nouns and sometimes they're treated as verbs depending on the demands of discourse. The example that this book has is in Dutch, but I'm more familiar with the German case which works in the same way, I think. This was one of those weird facts you have to learn about German adjectives if you learn German adjectives in school. Thy way that they articulate it in this book was not the way that I had learned this. It was just like, 'Here's this class of adjectives and it does several different weird things.' It's very cool when you think about it in this way, which is that when the adjective goes before the noun -- if you have something like 'a red cat,' 'a red car,' which is 'eine rote Katze,' 'ein rotes Auto.' 'A red balloon' -- 'ein roter Ballon.' In that case, the adjective, 'red,' has a different form depending on which noun it goes with. It acts like a noun because it gets all these noun endings depending on the gender. But if you say, 'The cat is red,' 'The car is red,' 'The balloon is red' -- 'Das Auto ist rot.' You don't put the ending there. You just have the bare form of the adjective. In that sense, it's acting more verb-like because it doesn't do the same gender agreement that it does when it's before the noun. This was taught to me as like, 'Here's this thing you have to memorise,' but to think about it in terms of a typological perspective of maybe adjectives are fake and these words are sometimes acting as nouns and sometimes acting as verbs depending on other things in the discourse, it's just a really interesting proposal. German speakers probably think that they have adjectives, but it's an interesting formal proposal."
47,110,Lauren,I like it as a way to re-think something you take for granted.
47,111,Gretchen,"Because it is true that sometimes they really seem to be very noun-y and they get these endings that the nouns get. Sometimes, they don't get these endings. There's also an extent to which they don't really act like verbs because verbs get endings depending on what -- if they were being really verb-y, you should have like, 'You 'red,'' 'Du 'rotest,'' which that doesn't -- 'Du 'rotst'' -- that doesn't exist. They don't act fully like verbs, but they could act in the same way that you can say, 'This is open,' 'This is closed,' 'This is opened,' 'It is closed.' It could be some sort of verbal participle thingy. I dunno. It's an interesting way of pointing out that even the diagnostics that say, 'It takes on morphosyntactic properties of one type of part of speech, therefore it must belong to the same category as that part of speech.' If you have a case where sometimes it has the same endings and sometimes it doesn't, then there are two things going on."
47,112,Lauren,Hmm. You've talked about four out of five possibilities for how things we think of as adjectives occur across the world's languages. What is the fifth?
47,113,Gretchen,The fifth one is also a part-time thing which is that some property concepts get treated as nouns and other ones get treated as verbs.
47,114,Lauren,"Right. So, kind of the opposite."
47,115,Gretchen,Right.
47,116,Lauren,Okay. This is our Manange example where you have that very small set that act as adjectives in a particular way and you have a set that act as more verb-y adjectives.
47,117,Gretchen,"Yeah. For example -- and I don't know if this is true of a particular language -- you could say, maybe, colours and numbers in this language get treated as verbs but sizes and qualities get treated as nouns or vice versa or some sort of distinction like that. The example in this book is with Yoruba, and I don't know enough Yoruba to have a concrete example of how that works."
47,118,Lauren,It does exist in real languages. That's good enough evidence for me.
47,119,Gretchen,"It kind of takes us to this question which, you know, is also a question, if we look back at the Latin based or Greek based -- because Greek did the same thing as Latin where it lumped nouns and adjectives together for, again, really good language internal reasons that they had the same sets of endings -- of, is the class of adjectives even valid? Is it even really a thing when you start looking at the different types of evidence for a distinct class of words, in this case, across different languages?"
47,120,Lauren,This brings us back to that question of those diagnostic criteria and the ways of testing if something is an adjective or maybe a noun or a verb that we talked about in more detail for English and a little bit of detail for other languages which is that you need to figure out the criteria that you're using for diagnosis in each language. You can't just come in with the English criteria and try and apply them to Yoruba or Manange or French because it won't work.
47,121,Gretchen,"It begs the question -- in English, there's an established grammatical tradition of saying, 'Here are the diagnostic criteria for adjectives' and if you're gonna work in English, it's useful to know what the rest of the literature says for what adjectives are. If you're working in a language where there hasn't been this descriptive grammatical tradition, you're coming in and saying, 'Okay, so, first thing I need to figure out -- are there any diagnoses that could prove that this is a different thing? What would it mean to be different? What are the language-internal things that could prove that some set of unknown words is different from some other set of other unknown words? I don't know what the words are in each of these categories yet.'"
47,122,Lauren,"Yes. I remember doing this for Yolmo. There's a bit of flexibility about whether an adjective can go before a noun or after a noun. They seem to mostly go before, I think, but I never actually -- with the data that I had -- managed to tease apart if it was a thing that was completely free or if it was because people were focusing on a particular bit of information and they wanted that at the start or the end. Going back to that thing about corpora, one of the examples that I have in the descriptive grammar of Lamjung Yolmo that I wrote is in there because I was just so excited to have a spontaneous example of someone saying a sentence that had three adjectives in it."
47,123,Gretchen,Because it's so rare!
47,124,Lauren,"Getting people to say something off the cuff with seven adjectives in it is so rare -- impossibly rare. Even just having three adjectives I was like, 'It's so pretty. I have no reason to put it in the grammar except that there're three adjectives here.' I had to start from scratch with this language -- well, start with the existing literature because why make life hard for yourself -- and figure out my own criteria for whether the category of adjectives existed at all to write about them in grammar and how to explain them."
47,125,Gretchen,"But the existing literature doesn't look something like the 1,000-plus page Cambridge Grammar of the English language that has everything described in exhaustive detail plus the hundreds of other books that are written about it. It's like, 'Oh, there are two books. Okay, that's fine.'"
47,126,Lauren,"There're a few things around, yes. It's these edge cases on edge cases that we've been talking about, which is why something like the Cambridge Grammar of the English Language doesn't just have, 'Adjectives describe and modify nouns.'"
47,127,Gretchen,"That's it. The one-page Cambridge Grammar of the English Language. That's all that's there. There's 1,000 pages of, I dunno, probably 50 or 100 pages about adjectives in CGL. I haven't checked."
47,128,Lauren,Looking at the variation across languages in how what we think of as adjectives behave and how you have to use language specific criteria for deciding if there are adjectives and what they look like brings us to a bigger philosophical question as to whether adjectives exist in Language as a thing at all -- once we start looking at all the variation across the world's languages.
47,129,Gretchen,"And even more broadly, whether it's legitimate to look at multiple languages and try to apply the same sets of categories. Is it legitimate to try to say that languages have nouns and languages have verbs? Even if we can establish maybe noun-hood and verb-hood -- because those are, I dunno, fairly basic -- does that mean that the more edge case-y categories like adjectives or adverbs or prepositions or something like that, which can sometimes be done with other types of grammatical features, do those exist? Is it even legitimate to try to cross apply these categories in languages? It's an ontological question that doesn't have an easy answer."
47,130,Lauren,This is actually an ongoing question in linguistics. It doesn't have an easy answer. People are still grappling with this idea of language internal categories versus language general categories.
47,131,Gretchen,"There's a large extent to which the categories that we think of as basic, primary categories -- nouns, verbs, adjectives -- are inherited from a particular type of intellectual tradition of looking at languages. I mean, kind of the Greek and Latin one except not entirely because they didn't actually necessarily think adjectives were entirely their own thing."
47,132,Lauren,What a revelation.
47,133,Gretchen,"It comes from a particular grammatical descriptive tradition. Perhaps, if we'd started with a different language, we might've said, ah, well, a really important distinction is -- let's say you're gonna be French -- whether it goes before the noun or after the noun. Actually, this is a fundamental distinction and we need to go looking for this distinction in a whole bunch of other languages because we have this easy diagnostic for it in French. Surely, there's some sort of fundamental ontological distinction between this set. So, where do you make your fundamental ontological distinctions and where do you say, 'Oh, actually, these are just two sub-types of adjectives' or 'These are two sub-types of verbs. Some of them just tend to be adje-verbs.'"
47,134,Lauren,This ongoing debate about word categories and their existence across language is so long-standing in linguistics that the two different sides of this argument as affectionately known as 'lumpers' and 'splitters.'
47,135,Gretchen,Great names.
47,136,Lauren,Great names. Whether you lump words together that may have been across what people have more lately decided as separate categories. Those original Latin grammarians lumping what we think of as nouns and adjectives together -- great lumpers. We're much more splitter-y in our approach these days.
47,137,Gretchen,"By comparison, we're much splitter-y. Whereas, if we were to say, oh, it turns out that the kinds of things that can go before a noun and after the noun are something different, we could become even more splitter-y if we wanted to. You can find people who'll argue for a lumpier approach or a splittier approach within the same language, sometimes using the same data to say, 'Oh, well, there are some similarities or there are some differences and it depends on whether you think the similarities are more important or the differences are more important for whether you're gonna argue for one or the other.' I love how it destabilises this -- we think of, again, as this fairly intuitive notion of an adjective to say, 'Well, maybe adjectives aren't a thing' or 'They're not a thing in all languages' or 'The evidence for them is different depending on what language you're looking at.'

Her linguistics research interests include language and ethnicity, sociolinguistics, and critical race theory. Welcome, Shivonne."
48,3,Shivonne,"Hi, Lauren! Thanks for having me."
48,4,Lauren,It is absolutely a delight to have you here today. Can you tell us a bit about how you got into linguistics?
48,5,Shivonne,"Sure. I actually got into linguistics when I was in sixth form, which is the last two years of high school in the UK. I did A level English language. As part of that, I did a mini research project."
48,6,Lauren,Cool!
48,7,Shivonne,"Yeah, it was really cool. I did some narrative analysis of a couple of recordings of my cousin at different developmental stages. He was, I think, something like 5 and 9. I compared how his narrative structures had developed over time, essentially."
48,8,Lauren,"Cool. Had you happened to just record him as a 5-year-old because he was cute, or were you thinking that you had plans to analyse his language?"
48,9,Shivonne,"Neither. His family just did lots of home videos, and something he liked to do for himself was just stand in front of the camera and record himself telling stories."
48,10,Lauren,"Oh, how wonderful."
48,11,Shivonne,"I got him to do another one at the time that was kind of so many years later. That was the one I asked him to do. It was just a stroke of luck that that data existed, essentially. I was really interested in child language acquisition. But also, as I think a lot of people are, I was also just interested in accents and the different ways that people spoke and understanding why that was and what kind of social things drove that. Then, I studied linguistics as an undergrad and then went on to master's and PhD after that."
48,12,Lauren,"Did you know from studying English language that linguistics was a thing that existed? Was it on your radar and you sought it out? Or did you get to university and go, 'Ah, here's the thing I wanted to do'?"
48,13,Shivonne,"So, something in the middle. I knew I really enjoying doing that research project, for example, in school. I didn't know what I wanted to study at university, so I spoke to my English teacher. She asked me what I enjoyed, and I told her the specific bits of our English course I liked. And she said, 'Oh, well, you should look for a university course that includes linguistics.' I had that steer from her to look for English language and linguistics undergrads. I ended up at the University of Sheffield and really, really loved it because there was a lot of flexibility in what we were able to study. I was able to really tailor in terms of what I studied, which I really enjoyed."
48,14,Lauren,"You managed to do a little bit of research in your high school subject, which is really cool. Is there, for you, a coherent narrative line between that and then going on to your PhD research?"
48,15,Shivonne,Not particularly beyond that that was linguistics. I honestly didn't see that as research at the time. I did think I really fully understood what that was. I only started to understand that university lecturers do research -- I only got that insight because I got a job as an RA for one summer in my penultimate summer. I think all of that only really came through towards the end of my undergrad and then through my master's.
48,16,Lauren,What did you do for your summer research position?
48,17,Shivonne,"I worked on Emma's Isle of Scilly project, which the Isles of Scilly are a group of islands off the southwest coast of England. They're about 30 miles off the very bottom corner off the coast of Cornwall. They're quite isolated because of that. Emma has gone on holiday there for years. She discovered an archive of video interviews and, as a linguist, had some thoughts about the local dialect and wanted to explore a bit more. When she found this archive, it was like, 'Jackpot -- I've got all this data!' My role was to help do all the data management for that, essentially -- transcribing and archiving the data. Then, because I'd had that involvement with the data, at that point, I was then able to write my undergrad dissertation on some of the data. That was really cool."
48,18,Lauren,Amazing! I love the theme with your high school work of finding existing recordings and using them strategically. I think that's a really nice thing that a lot of us can learn from using data that's already out there in the world.
48,19,Shivonne,"Yeah, definitely. I hadn't even picked up on that until you just pointed it out, actually. But, yeah, I mean, especially as an undergrad, it took a lot of stress out of the dissertation because I didn't have to do the data collection. I already had it. It absolutely makes sense to do things like that when we can."
48,20,Lauren,And what makes this dialect so distinct?
48,21,Shivonne,"I think the reason it's interesting is because there's not been a lot of research about it but the stuff that has been written, essentially, just kind of lumped it together with Cornwall. But as we see quite often with island communities, it's a lot more insular than Cornwall. You get the thing that you see quite often -- I think Martha's Vineyard is a classic example -- of somewhere touristy that young people then leave and don't want to go back to. You get a traditional older people living -- who work in the tourist industry. Then, on the Isles of Scilly, you also get a lot of more wealthy people going there to retire and having holiday homes there and stuff like that. The thing that I looked at for my undergrad dissertation was the stylistic variation because their video archive had two different interviewers. There was a local person who'd done some interviews, but then also somebody who had moved there later in life did some interviews as well. I looked at the differences with a couple of speakers in how they interacted with those two different interviewers. There are definitely differences from Cornish English for sure. The vowel space looks slightly different. I can't -- honestly, it's so long ago since I looked at that I can't remember the details. But, yeah, there were definitely differences in terms of pronunciation as well as grammatical stuff. Emma's done a lot of work on it since then."
48,22,Lauren,"I assume that when people were chatting to the more local interviewer, they tended to be even more strongly local in their pronunciation and their word choices. Did that come through?"
48,23,Shivonne,"Yeah, exactly. I remember one of them, it was almost like he was a different person with the local interviewer. He was a lot more talkative and, for me, a lot more difficult to understand because his accent was pretty broad. They're also rhotic in that part of the country, which isn't that typical of the rest England. That threw me for a loop to get my ears into listening to that dialect."
48,24,Lauren,"It is something that, in terms of the methodology for how people collect data, deciding who was going to be the person that goes into that space and does that data collection is going to really influence how people speak and the type of data you collect. You've had to, I know, kind of think about this really critically and come up with some innovative ways in your own later research when you started to collect data as well -- how to navigate that."
48,25,Shivonne,"Yeah. I think it's something that, as linguists, quite often we know that that's there and that's an important thing to consider. But sometimes it's almost like, well, if we acknowledge, it then that's enough. I don't think we are always as critical of that as we could be -- or critical in acknowledging how that shapes the findings that we get."
48,26,Lauren,All of this experience led you to then -- did you go into a master's or did you go into a PhD programme?
48,27,Shivonne,"I went into a master's program. I did a master's degree at North Carolina State University. That experience was really affirming in terms of that I want to be a linguist and also really eye-opening in terms of different ways of being a linguist, like doing more impact-related stuff -- I hate the way that 'impact,' I think, is a really kind of UK higher education buzzword."
48,28,Lauren,Definitely.
48,29,Shivonne,"But basically doing more public-facing linguistics and doing linguistics that is for and serves the communities that you're collecting data from. I really enjoyed that experience. It was a two-year master's as well, which I think if you're gonna do a master's -- a one-year master's is typical of a UK master's."
48,30,Lauren,It's a 'Blink and it's over' situation.
48,31,Shivonne,"It's just not enough. And, yeah, because it was two years, I was able to spend the first year properly getting more closely into sociolinguistics specifically. And then in my second year I had the time to actually develop a research project in a way that I think you don't necessarily have the time to do if you do a one-year master's. It's all like a big rush in the summer. And, you know, I got into conferencing and doing all that other I find fun academic related stuff as well because we had the time to do that. Yeah, I really enjoyed my time there. Then, I went straight from the master's to the PhD. At that point, when I did my master's, I was like, 'I know I want to do a PhD.' I ended up at Queen Mary University for that."
48,32,Lauren,Did you have an idea when you went into the PhD program what you wanted to work on? How did you come to decide on your area of focus?
48,33,Shivonne,"Throughout all of my undergrad research project and my master's research project what I was really interested in stylistic variation. We all, I think, are aware that -- even if we're not linguists -- we're aware that we'll talk differently to different people, or we have a job interview voice, or a telephone voice, and all those types of things. I found that stuff really interesting. I think when I was doing master's Sarah Benor's paper on ethnolinguistic repertoires came out. Devyani Sharma had also published some stuff recently about stylistic variation in a British Asian community in London. It was just, for me, a really hot topic and something that I was really interested in -- how people moved it forward using different methodologies and trying to really unpick stylistic variation as it happens on an everyday basis, rather than the traditional Labovian approach is to look at, you know, 'Oh, let's have a reading list, and we'll compare that to spontaneous interview speech.' But, of course, those are quite artificial speech contexts. It's not the same as how we're interacting on a daily basis. I was really interested in the fact that things were moving towards getting into more detail about that. That's what I did my master's project on. I got some self-recorded data and looked at stylistic variation in that. My PhD project, I initially proposed to do the same in London with adolescents. I was also really interested in some recent work that had come out about Multicultural London English, which is this variety of English in London that has emerged over the last 20 years. Jenny Cheshire and Paul Kerswell and team had been publishing on that. I think at that point there'd only been two or three publications. It was all quite new still. I was interested in bringing those two things together -- finding out more about Multicultural London English but looking at stylistic variation using more novel methods for doing that in London."
48,34,Lauren,"I think it's worth flagging for people who aren't familiar with the UK context just how different London is but also is perceived to be from the rest of the country. This is mostly my outsider-who-came-and-lived-there-for-a-couple-of-years view, but it seems -- I mean, London does just have a lot more linguistic and ethnic diversity than many other places in the UK. There's also this idea for many people mentally that if you're a Londoner you may not visit other parts of the country very much. It has a mental state a bit like people talk about New York or something. So, the linguistic context of what's happening in London is very specific to the ethic and social and economic dynamics of that particular part of the country."
48,35,Shivonne,"Absolutely. It's a real economic hub, isn't it, London, in the UK. Post-PhD, that's why I stayed in London because that's where the jobs are. Things like, I think -- these figures are not precise but just as a rough idea -- I think something like the percentage of black Britons in the UK is 2% or 3%, but then in London it's like 13%. It's really, really quite different. Comparing even with other cities, it's just a really unique social context in London compared to the rest of England and the UK."
48,36,Lauren,That's the London part of London Multicultural English. I don't think I've ever really interrogated what the 'multicultural' is doing in that name. Is there an assumption that it's a particular set of cultural groups who have come together to form this variety?
48,37,Shivonne,"This is my interpretation. I think to really get a proper answer about why it was given that name you'd have to go to Jenny and Paul who decided that's the label they wanted to give. I also think it's important to say I think they recognise that it's an imperfect label. But I think the idea behind it was essentially, when they were first observing language change in London and doing their data collection, I think there was an expectation that there might be some differences between speakers depending on their ethnic or cultural background because London has so much -- it's ethnically diverse, but there's a lot of people moving into London as well as people whose parents or grandparents were immigrants. There's also a lot of ongoing in-migration into London of people from all over the place. Other cities in the UK will have a lot of immigrants from Poland or that -- but London, people are coming from everywhere. So, I think, essentially, what they found was that language had shifted amongst working class young people in London, but there weren't significant differences between the young people because of their background, it was because of who they were friends with -- so peer social networks. The young people with the more ethnically diverse social groups, they were the ones who used the linguistic features of Multicultural London English. That included white British young people in London -- or adolescents. I think the intention of that label is to essentially say you can't predict who is going to speak this way based off of the more traditional social categories that we use in linguistics. The young people were predominantly working class, and they predominantly lived in inner-city London. But in terms of ethnicity or culture or other languages spoken or anything like that, none of that stuff predicted. It was the diversity of their peer group networks."
48,38,Lauren,"Right. It is worth flagging as well, one thing that that I really noticed in the UK is obviously race and ethnicity and cultural background are something that people are very aware of and talk about a lot, but this idea of class and working class is very ingrained in the British mentality as well in a way that -- Australians are very desperate to believe that we are some kind of egalitarian society. If you speak to any Australian, they'll say they're middle class. Whereas, in Britain, everyone seemed quite okay with pointing out who was working class and who was middle class and who was posh. You had all these social markers about where you went on holiday and what supermarket you shopped at were meant to give insights into this structure of class. I found that really different to how Australians perceive themselves, and I think it also feeds into people's language choices."
48,39,Shivonne,"I think the key thing that's really different about the UK context compared to Australia and also America is that people who identify as working class are proud of that. There's no shame about being working class. That's not to say some people don't feel ashamed. Some people want to be socially upwardly mobile, and they want to leave behind their working class roots. But for those people that are working class and identify as working class, all the cultural things that come with that, they're important, and they're valuable, and they're proud of those things. I don't see those same dynamics coming out in other western English-speaking countries. I think you might have that -- using America as an example -- you might have it in a specific city or specific town or within a state, for example, but there's not this more unified across the country sense of being working class is something you can be proud of. I think you do have that in the UK. It's definitely different."
48,40,Lauren,"You have to pay attention in this complex social environment to all of these factors but, as you said, the thing that seems to determine what variety people use is their social network. Of course, you looked at an environment where social networks are -- maybe the most important place in the world for social networks. You went and looked at people and their language and their social dynamics in high school."
48,41,Shivonne,"Yeah. I love teenagers. I think teenagers are fascinating. I think they're great and interesting people. I think that quite often because it's such a quick transitional time, I think we often don't engage with teenagers enough. Yes, I was really keen to go into a school and -- it's where they spend so much time. It's where they're doing a lot of their identity forming and figuring out who they are. I thought it would be a really interesting way to get a bit more insight about how all of that works for these young people. As I said before, I was interested in looking at stylistic variation. I went into it with the assumption that these young people, because they lived in an inner-city area of East London, that their language would reflect what had been found previously by Jenny Cheshire and Paul Kerswell. However, I came up against two things that were unexpected, 1.) that getting teenagers to cooperate -- that's the wrong phrasing because that's obviously unethical. You're not persuading people, pressuring people, into doing research. But essentially presenting to them the value of engaging with the research was definitely challenging. My intended approach to collect data on stylistic variation was not feasible. I wanted to do self-recording. I was doing interviews with them, but I wanted them to record themselves in lessons when I wasn't present, and I wanted them to record themselves at home -- just having dinner with their family or hanging out with their mates. Basically, they just would take the recorders and it would sit under their bed for a month. Or they would use it and they would do something really, really performative, which is not un-useful data but, you know, there needs to be other stuff to compliment that. It's really difficult."
48,42,Lauren,But your genius data collection plans were thwarted by teenagers.
48,43,Shivonne,"Essentially. But that's the nature of doing research, isn't it? You've just gotta roll with it when things come up that you don't expect. I did traditional sociolinguistic interviews, and I was also doing ethnographic work alongside that. I got a load of data anyway. It just shifted the focus of my work. Then, I also -- because of the work that had been done previously -- I didn't anticipate ethnic identity as being something that would be overly salient for these young people. I think it's definitely just kind of a problem in general in diverse urban centres across Europe. The way that they're presented it is quite often just, 'Oh, well, they're just really diverse and ethnicity doesn't matter anymore.' It's almost like that colour blindness in looking at race and all that type of stuff. I bought into that. Then, when I went into the school, I was like, 'Wow, no. That's not -- no. That's not what's happening here.' It is important."
48,44,Lauren,What was happening for the kids?
48,45,Shivonne,"Well, the girls in particular. In some respects it was things that were to be expected. Everything was super gendered. The girls hung out with the girls. The boys hung out with the boys. They had their different areas in the yard outside where they would go at their breaktimes or recess or whatever you call it. They had very typical gendered social practices. The boys would go and play football at breaktime. The girls would sit on the steps and gossip and do their ma -- you know, all of that stuff was all just like when I was in school. It's not changed. However, there were all of these little nuances to how they presented themselves which, for me, a lot of it was grounded in asserting their ethnic identity. Part of why I'm able to say that so confidently is because that's what they called themselves -- their peer groups, the girl peer groups. There was the black squad. There was the Asian squad. There was the white squad. And then there was the Skittle squad because they were all different colours. They rebranded themselves after I'd been there for about a term -- the main squad -- because they wanted to assert themselves as the popular ones. But, yeah, I mean, just the fact that those were the labels -- and they weren't throwaway labels. That's how they referred to each other across peer groups as well. I mean, how can you say that that's not an important part of their identity if that's what they're actually calling themselves? Then, you know, there's the hair styles. There were differences between the groups in terms of what they did with their hair and how they wore their -- they wore school uniforms, but there were differences in how they wore their uniforms. All that type of stuff was going on. Yeah. I was not expecting that."
48,46,Lauren,"Yeah. After being told you were expecting everyone to just be one big happy melting pot, those group creation strategies were still there."
48,47,Shivonne,"There's this term 'homophily' -- I think 'homophily.' It's basically, when there are people like you, you will gravitate towards those people. I think, for me, an explanation for why we don't always see that in ethnically diverse communities is because sometimes there just aren't enough other people like you. You're not gonna not have any friends as a teenager. From my own experience, for example, I'm a mixed-race black woman. I grew up in the countryside in rural Shropshire, so there was no one else that looked like me. But I wasn't gonna not have friends. So, all my friends were white. But if there was someone who looked remotely like me, I definitely gravitated towards them. I can personally relate to that feeling. I think my experience at this school was a really nice example of where this can happen -- it does happen -- because that stuff is important."
48,48,Lauren,"I think it's one of those things where, especially when there is a feeling that there is so much divide around race or ethnicity, we can forget that being aware of race is not in itself a racist action. Students in this school are probably doing a better job of navigating a complex cultural environment than a lot of adults seem to manage to do."
48,49,Shivonne,"I think then the interesting thing for me was how that then related to their language and their linguistic practices. Going back to what I was interested in in the beginning, Multicultural London English, that definitely was present, but there were differences, particularly for the girls. The white squad girls sounded, without doing any recordings or analysis, they just sounded very different to their peers. Their pronunciation was different. They did not have the same vowels that were documented in the MLE literature. What I heard then played out in my analysis. Unfortunately, I didn't get a huge amount of data from the boys, so it's difficult to say for sure, but there was definitely descriptive evidence that there were differences for -- the black boys were the more advanced in terms of MLE pronunciation, as in they sounded the most MLE, shall we say, than the other boys. There were definitely ethnic differences going on there. That's not to say it was just about ethnicity. There's all this other stuff going on. It's definitely gendered. There's definitely stuff going on also in terms of their school identity -- how they orientated towards the school. The main squad, for example, they were a mixed ethnicity group, and those girls didn't tend to sound as MLE as, say, the black squad. But they were also very pro-school. They wanted to do well in school. There were differences in terms of that type of stuff. It's just super complex."
48,50,Lauren,"That reminds me a little bit of Mary Bucholtz's work in the US looking at nerd girls and how people who are pro-school and very comfortable with school tend to have more standardised language, and they're moving more towards using the teachers as their peers almost more than their actual peer groups because they want to set themselves apart. It's interesting that those dynamics play out in this context as well."
48,51,Shivonne,"Absolutely. Even with the boys, there were two boys. They were both really bright, just characters, really stood out in their year group. That's, I guess, partly why I ended up being drawn to interviewing them. Addy -- this is a pseudonym, of course -- Addy was very pro-school. He did lots of extra-curricular activities and wanted to do really well. And he sounded not very MLE. He sounded definitely London, but not this shift in vowels and grammar that we see in MLE. Then John, on the other hand, he was smart. He did do well at school, but he very intentionally -- it's almost like he kept that hidden. It wasn't part of his identity to be good at school. It was part of his identity to be, like, a cool guy. He was really into music. He sounded very MLE. So, there's definitely all of that interesting stuff going on here as well. It just would've been really nice to have got some more data from a greater range of kids in this school because I think, yeah, to be able to unpick all of that a little bit more I think would've been really nice."
48,52,Lauren,Was that part of what your ethnographic methods were trying to get at -- understanding all of these social dynamics?
48,53,Shivonne,"Yeah, absolutely. I mean, all of that stuff I just told you about -- the different characteristics of the peer groups and differences between those two boys -- that's purely because I went to school three to five days a week, not necessarily for the entire school day each time. But I would observe at least two lessons, and I made an effort to stay there through their -- they had their recess break mid-morning and then they had their lunch break. I would always be there for those periods so that I could go and hang out with them outside when they weren't in the classroom."
48,54,Lauren,They got used to you being around.
48,55,Shivonne,"Yeah. Because of the way that the national curriculum is designed, when they're in lessons, it's just like, they're on a schedule. They have stuff to get through. There's a lot of content that is being delivered and that they're supposed to be kind of -- so actually the amount of interaction they're doing in the classroom really varied. One of my favourite lessons to observe, actually, was they had a citizenship lesson. That was a lot more -- there was a lot more dialogue because that was that was part of the, you know. But something like English or maths was just like, content, content, content, learn this stuff. Being outside was really key to be able to have that. Then it was interesting to be able to reflect and see how much of what was going on outside was brought into the classroom in terms of their social dynamics and things. I even went and observed after school things, netball games, theatre stuff. I really tried to see them in as many contexts as possible to be able to understand their social practices and linguistic practices as fully as possible."
48,56,Lauren,"Amazing. Because language is, as you have discovered, incredibly complex and messy and tied up in our identity and our aspirations and our peer groups. It's really great to have been able to go really deep into one little community and see what was happening there."
48,57,Shivonne,"Definitely. I think that's part of what drew me to working with teenagers specifically because I think that's when we're most creative, I think, because we're figuring all of that stuff out. It was really fascinating to see that in action and be with these kids for a year and see how they changed over that time. It was a real privilege to be able to have done that."
48,58,Lauren,And you finished your PhD around 12 months ago?
48,59,Shivonne,A bit longer. It's two years since I submitted my thesis. We just have a really delayed graduation in the UK.
48,60,Lauren,"Ah, yeah. We have the same in Australia. Did you share your dissertation with the students, and did they have any opinions on it?"
48,61,Shivonne,"I didn't share my dissertation because by the time I finished it, they would've left school But what I did do was, after I finished my fieldwork, I think it was the next semester, I went back and I did a presentation -- not like a formal presentation. It tried to be interactive, but basically just all the stuff I had observed that they did, I just kind of made an effort to validate that and say, 'Here are all these things you do with your language. Isn't it really cool that all of this stuff has a function, and this stuff is part of your identity, and it's legitimate? It's not wrong or incorrect.' That was really important to me to be able to do that for them because I think that's definitely a message that gets given to adolescents repeatedly through schools in the UK is that there's a right and wrong way to speak. I think that's a real shame when that's such an integral part of who you are and your identity."
48,62,Lauren,"Who you are and what your identity is, high school is a very emotional time to be prodded on those things even in the best of circumstances. Having someone affirm just how cool MLE is, I'm sure, was really great. You have had a, do we say, a lateral move since finishing your dissertation into, still a research career, but a very different pace of research."
48,63,Shivonne,"Yeah. I mean, as I said before, the stuff that's got me fired up about linguistics was doing stuff that's more public-facing, and that's what I really got out of my master's. I tried to carry that on throughout my PhD. I was never really 100% sure that academia was for me. Through having that at the back of my mind during my PhD, I was able to do research along the way about alternatives. I didn't get to the end and think, 'Oh, no! What am I gonna do now?' I put the time in of looking at alternatives and come across social research which is essentially using a lot of the methodological skills that I developed and learnt through my master's and PhD but, instead of using it just for linguistics, I use those skills to unpick more general social questions/social problems. Quite often, these are directly related to policy. So that's what I do at the National Centre for Social Research. I work on the Children and Families Team, specifically. So, the thread there is I do research in schools still. I do research with children and young people still. While there's not as much scope as I would like to do linguistic stuff, I loved all of that other stuff that I did for my fieldwork. The language is fascinating, but all that other stuff is fascinating too. Being able to find out about people's lives and find out about how young people feel about a new educational programme -- they've tried all that stuff -- is also really fascinating to me. It's been a really good alternative career track to go down for sure."
48,64,Lauren,"When you say it's research that directly affects policy, you mean government policy around the implementation of different programmes and stuff. There's a really direct line between the research projects that you do and that feeding into things that change government policy or direct government policy."
48,65,Shivonne,"Yeah. Sometimes it's about evaluating programmes and assessing whether those programmes have any impact, that they're doing what they're intended to do. Are they making any change? Sometimes it's just actually finding out about, okay, the government has implemented a new policy, how is that going? How are the people this is supposed to help -- how do they actually feel about it? How is it actually affecting their lives? One project that I did recently was about shared parental leave. That was a policy. It was implemented in 2014. It was this idea that in the UK you still just have maternity and paternity leave. Now, you can split it between both parents. So, it not only improves things for heterosexual couples but also gives more options to couples who are adopting and same sex couples -- not just the traditional heteronormative approach to parenting."
48,66,Lauren,Sounds great!
48,67,Shivonne,"There's a lot more options. Yes, sounds great! In theory. But there's not been as much take up as they had hoped, so our project -- we interviewed people who had taken it and who had chosen not to, and their employers, and different people, to find out not just what the individual's experiences were but also what kind of workplace barriers might there be to why people have not engaged with this policy as much as might have been hoped. That was really fascinating to be able to do that. It's really topical. It's something that while we were doing the research every month The Guardian was publishing an article about it. It was something that was really topical, and people are interested in. Doing stuff like that is really, really cool."
48,68,Lauren,"It's great that your linguistics PhD gave you heaps of training in general skills for doing this kind of research, but you make it sound now like it was a decision you were okay with to move into working in a non-academic research stream. But did it feel like an easy decision at the time? Or it is something that was more difficult?"
48,69,Shivonne,"I mean, I'll be honest, it didn't feel like a decision. It felt like just kind of how things panned out. Obviously, I'm able to reflect on it and make it sound positive. I'm definitely very happy where I am now, but it took a while to get there, Lauren. It took a while. [Laughs] I had a lot of feelings about not getting an academic job. I felt like I'd failed because I'd not got a job in academia. I felt resentful because I'd done everything that I was supposed to do. I'd not just done my PhD. I did the teaching on top of it. I worked as an RA. I did all this other stuff. I've got a publication. And then that still wasn't good enough to even get interviews. I just found that so upsetting and so frustrating. But because alongside that I had done all this -- I knew this was a possibility along the way, I just I think possibly didn't realise quite how much of a possibility that it was that I wouldn't get an academic job."
48,70,Lauren,Yeah. I don't know how well we set people up for that to be honest.
48,71,Shivonne,"I think it's one of these things that I knew it was a possibility, but I honestly thought wouldn't apply to me because you've got on to a PhD programme, and you're succeeding in that, you feel like, 'Okay, well' --"
48,72,Lauren,'I've survived this far.'
48,73,Shivonne,'Why should I not' -- yeah.
48,74,Lauren,I think there's a sense of survivor bias from -- your professors have generally been in academia for a while. That's why they're professors and supervising dissertations. And it means that training people in linguistics with the expectation they'll got out into industry is definitely not the default way we approach things even though that's what's gonna happen for the majority of graduates on a basic numbers level.
48,75,Shivonne,"I think as well, like, I mean, it's also changed a lot. I'm just thinking of my mentors. Emma Moore, I think, went from her PhD to her job -- you know, maybe worked at Manchester where she did he PhD for a bit and then went to Sheffield and got her job there, and that's where she is now. Devyani was my PhD advisor. She went straight from her PhD at Stanford to a full-time permanent job at Kings and then moved to Queen Mary. While they were supportive and endeavoured to help me to be realistic, I think the fact is that's not their experience of the academic job market. They're not able to give realistic advice. I should also say that I was very clear in that I did not want to move around. I was like, 'I've already done that. I've done my degrees in three different cities in two different countries. I just want to have my feet on the ground for a bit.' I knew that in making that choice, that massively limited my ability to get on the ladder. I just accepted that to be honest."
48,76,Lauren,I think knowing yourself is more important than chasing a postdoc and then another postdoc and then maybe I'm actually just talking about myself now. [Laughs]
48,77,Shivonne,"I mean, it's really difficult. I definitely get pangs of like, 'Oh, I miss linguistics.' I'll see people tweeting about stuff, and then I'm like, 'Oh, I wish I could go to that conference' or 'I wish I could find time to write a paper. I really want to have a paper for my dissertation. It would be really cool to have that out there.' But then I'm just like, but I have work-life balance, and I have a job that I really like, and those things were really important to me. And I've got them."
48,78,Lauren,"And you didn't even have to leave London, which is a nice addition."
48,79,Shivonne,"Well, exactly. It swings in roundabouts, isn't it. But, yeah, it sounds like a straightforward trajectory, and I guess on paper it was, but there was definitely a lot of emotional turmoil along the way for sure."
48,80,Lauren,Thank you for sharing the linear narrative and the feelings behind the narrative. I think it's important to acknowledge that and acknowledge that a lot of people do hope for the best and it doesn't always pan out in terms of academic careers.
48,81,Shivonne,"I should also say that even in terms of non-academic work -- 'alt-academic work,' if you wanna call it -- I really like my job now. I didn't at first. It was a real -- I talked about it with my line manager at the time and stuff. It was a real transition. It wasn't a transition in terms of my ability to do the job. I was more than capable of doing the job, and I performed well at my job. It was just finding it difficult to be in a space that was so different to what I had been used to. The things that I enjoy about my job now were also challenging at first in terms of working on project teams and not having the final say in terms of what the research design was or all those types of things."
48,82,Lauren,A very different dynamic.
48,83,Shivonne,"I love working on teams. I didn't not like working on teams then, but, you know, I love that now that you get to share the responsibility, you get to bounce ideas off of each other, the writing up findings into a report isn't as traumatic as writing in academia a paper or something because -- especially when you're junior. I'm sure it gets easier when you're older. But sharing that load is actually really fulfilling and enjoyable. But, yeah, it can definitely take time to adjust."
48,84,Lauren,"Of course, even though you don't do linguistics research in your day-to-day job, you are always a linguist."
48,85,Shivonne,Absolutely.
48,86,Lauren,Do you have any go-to linguistics examples or stories or explanations that you find yourself reaching for when people ask about linguistics?
48,87,Shivonne,"I mean, obviously, it depends what they ask, but I'll just give an example that used recently that, quite often, the things that are socially stigmatised in terms of language, there is evidence of similar patterns in other dialects or at a previous time where it wasn't stigmatised. That just really shows us why it's about who is using this feature rather than about the feature itself. The example I used for that, the person I was talking to was asking me about 'aks' instead of 'ask,' so metathesis -- swapping those two sounds round at the end, which is quite often stigmatised because it'll be black speakers who are using it and it's something that's evident in the US and also here in the UK. And I said, 'Well, you know, that was the way that people used to say it hundreds of years ago.' I think there are examples of it in Shakespeare. Shakespeare is revered and black people are generally kind of oppressed. It just really shows you that it's not the language, it's the people."
48,88,Lauren,That's a great one to go to. Because I know it does stand out for people as a salient feature.
48,89,Shivonne,"Yeah, it really does."
48,90,Lauren,"If you could leave people knowing one thing about linguistics, what would it be?"
48,91,Shivonne,[Sighs] I think my pet peeve is when people are described as 'having an accent.' We all have accents. We all use language in a way that has a social function. The reason that some things are stigmatised and others aren't isn't because there are good or bad ways of speaking. It's because we see people as being less than or as something to aspire to. I think recognising that is really key in shifting the narrative on those types of things.
48,92,Lauren,"That is a great sentiment to end on. Thank you so much, Shivonne, for chatting with us today about Multicultural London English and linguistic variation."
48,93,Shivonne,"Thanks, Lauren. I really enjoyed being here. It was a great conversation. [Music]"

49,11,Gretchen,"So, Lauren, I'm gonna talk to you about Beowulf."
49,12,Lauren,I know this because you have been messaging me for weeks about how we have to talk about Beowulf.
49,13,Gretchen,"There's a new translation of Beowulf. I'm really excited. This made me want to build an entire episode around the translator's relationship to the text because this new translation of Beowulf does a really cool job of it, and I wanna talk about it."
49,14,Lauren,I don't think you've been this excited about a translated text since Emily Wilson translated The Odyssey. I'm pretty sure that's what motivated our 18th episode on word translation.
49,15,Gretchen,"You are not wrong about this. I think there's a similar excitement that I have which is old texts -- texts that are a thousand-plus years old that have been translated so many different times by so many different people -- it feels like it's hard for someone to do something new with a translation of them. And yet, here people are doing that, which is exciting to me. This is the new translation of Beowulf by Maria Dahvana Headley. She's done some really cool things with translating Beowulf as a feminist text. It's a text that uses very modern style language in this thousand-year-old epic poem of Old English literature."
49,16,Lauren,"I feel like when it comes to translating, before you even translate one single word, there's all these decisions that a translator has to make. In Episode 18, we looked at translation, but we looked at word-to-word translation. And that's definitely one part of a translator's job, but they have so many more decisions to make. It is such an impressive job, and it's why it's as much an art form as it is a technical skill to translate something well. So, what are some of the big decisions that Headley made before even starting to translate Beowulf?"
49,17,Gretchen,"One of the things about Beowulf is, as an oral poem, it has this intricate rhyme scheme. The Old English rhyme scheme is based on half lines. Each line has two halves and there needs to be an alliterative bit in one half that is repeated in the second half."
49,18,Lauren,"So, Old English is way more interested in alliteration compared to our modern English obsession with rhyming. That's one of the stylistic features you find in Old English."
49,19,Gretchen,"It's all about the beginning of the words rather than the ends. Trying to figure out, okay, how much am I gonna use alliteration? How much am I gonna try to represent -- because we can do alliteration in modern English -- how much am I gonna try to represent the existing rhyme scheme? Where am I gonna try to put it in actual rhymes like you would do in modern English -- if you're writing a poem, you might rhyme it? What am I gonna do with the metre? She's produced this really oral text that uses a certain amount of modern slang as well in ways that are really effective. One example is there's a dragon in Beowulf, and the dragon at one point is described as 'Putting the world on blast.'"
49,20,Lauren,Nice.
49,21,Gretchen,"To some extent, this is modern slang, but it's also a very literal thing that a dragon can do. It's not using modern slang for gratuitous -- like, there's no 'lols' or 'omgs' in this text. It's not like here's this facile text-speak version of Beowulf. It's what are the bits here that actually work with the metre and the rhyme scheme but also not shying away from using a modern idiom where a modern idiom really works."
49,22,Lauren,"It's interesting to put this in contrast to the other most famous version of Beowulf in translation that I know of which is Seamus Heaney's from somewhere in the middle of the 20th Century where I feel like he tried to capture the mythical grandeur of Old English and chose very stoic, solid sounding Old English words. I don't think he would've had the dragon 'putting the world on blast.'"
49,23,Gretchen,"Well, I don't think he would've -- I think it came out in 1999, this translation. In some ways his translation is fairly vernacular, but he tries to do that in a different sense. Can I read you the first bit of the Headley translation and the Heaney translation?"
49,24,Lauren,Yeah. This is super fun.
49,25,Gretchen,"Okay. A big thing about Beowulf translations is the first word which in Old English is 'Hwaet.' That has gotten repurposed as a meme, which we're not gonna get into much detail about. Some people translate that as like, 'Lo!' or 'Hark!' or 'Listen!' or something like this. Heaney translates that as 'So,' which has already got a certain level of vernacularity to it. His first three lines go, 'So, the Spear-Danes in days gone by and the kings who ruled them had courage and greatness. We have heard of those princes' heroic campaigns.' This is very stately and like, 'Here's this thing you're gonna do.' If you compare that with the first three lines of the Headley translation, the new one, she translates this 'Hwaet' as 'Bro.'"
49,26,Lauren,"Hm, that's a very different tone."
49,27,Gretchen,"It's a very modern tone. I mean, you could pick a whole bunch of very modern things like 'Yo' or 'Hey all,' but specifically the reason she picks 'Bro' is because she wants to highlight the bro culture-ness of this entire story. You can see that in the next couple lines which is, 'Bro, tell me we still know how to speak of kings. In the old days, everyone knew what men were -- brave, bold, glory bound. Only stories now, but all sound the Spear-Dane song, hoarded for hungry times.' It just leaps off the page in a way that really excites me."
49,28,Lauren,"Yeah, no 'princes' there."
49,29,Gretchen,Right. 'Kings who ruled had courage and greatness' -- 'The men were bold.'
49,30,Lauren,"The thing I always love about Beowulf is that it's a millennium-old oral poem that happened to be written down, and a millennium ago people were like, 'Let me tell you about the olden days.' [Laughter]"
49,31,Gretchen,"Right, it still takes place in this semi-mythic space, and it uses a certain stylised language that we even think was stylised at the time. You're always picking between some kind of stylisation. There's no neutral choice that exists. All of the choices are recreations at some level."
49,32,Lauren,"I mean, it is kind of weird to think you're translating from English into English, but it just shows how much the language has moved on because reading Beowulf if you don't know Old English is an incredibly uncomfortable attempt to just guess some words that have retained some familiarity. I always find it interesting that you have to translate. And then because English went through enough changes by Shakespeare, we kind of put up with all of the features of Shakespeare that aren't immediately obvious to us."
49,33,Gretchen,"Right. But Beowulf is really this alien text. Like, 'Hwaet. We Gardena' -- and 'Gardena' is 'Spear-Danes,' but we don't have 'Spear-Danes,' and 'Gardena' is not obviously related to those. There's this great miniseries from The History of English Podcast that does a very in-depth line-by-line reading of Beowulf which I enjoyed a while back."
49,34,Lauren,My one semantic anecdote from that series is 'Gar-Danes' as in 'Spear-Danes' -- garlic is the 'spear-leek.'
49,35,Gretchen,"Yes, it is!"
49,36,Lauren,Because it's like a little spear.
49,37,Gretchen,It's like a little spear-leek. I love that anecdote. It's interesting to be reading Beowulf at the same time that my book club is actually reading The Tale of Genji.
49,38,Lauren,"Ah, from like a similar -- Genji's also a millennium old, yeah?"
49,39,Gretchen,Yeah! In some sense it's like Beowulf and Genji are kind of contemporaries.
49,40,Lauren,"But they're very much not contemporaries. Beowulf is about warrior bro culture in the Old English setting, whereas Genji is a Japanese court drama."
49,41,Gretchen,"I don't think they would've gotten along. I think they would've just found each other completely incomprehensible. Genji's also one of those classic texts that's been translated a whole bunch of different times in a whole bunch of different ways. For one thing, you're translating from a much older version of Japanese. There are modern Japanese translations of The Tale of Genji as well. And then you're also translating into a different cultural context. But the cultural context for Beowulf is also very weird. Like, I don't do going and fighting monsters under lakes any more than I do writing haikus about the moon. In fact, I'm probably more likely to write a haiku about the moon than I am to go fight a monster under a lake if we wanna talk about relatability."
49,42,Lauren,Everything I know about Genji is because one of my colleagues in the Languages Department at La Trobe is a Genji studies scholar. It's one of those pieces of work that is so big and so canonical that it has its own literary studies tradition associated with it. I also really love my colleague because the other part of her expertise is cosplay studies. I think it's such a great combination of Japanese cultural experience there -- Genji and cosplay.
49,43,Gretchen,"I mean, what more do you want? The neat thing about reading Tale of Genji at the moment is because I'm reading it as part of a book club through Argo Bookshop -- which is a bookstore that did the book launch party for Because Internet and I really like them -- they're having this Tale of Genji book club, and we've been reading it throughout the year a few chapters at a time because it's over 1,000 pages. It's huge. So, we've been reading it section by section, and different members of the book club have picked different translations into English of the same work."
49,44,Lauren,"Ah, cool! Are there radical differences between the translations? Or do they all try and go for a literal approach?"
49,45,Gretchen,"They're really different. One of the big things with Genji is at the time in 11th Century Japan it was considered very rude in the court to refer to people by their actual names. None of the characters in the original Tale of Genji manuscript have names, except for maybe Genji. So, you can imagine reading a thousand-page book where none of the characters have names is a bit of a feat of the imagination."
49,46,Lauren,Yes.
49,47,Gretchen,"Different translations -- and a lot of them have conventional names that literary scholars have used to talk about the characters. For example, Lady Fujitsubo lives in the Fujitsubo, which is the western pavilion, and so she gets called in the tradition 'Fujitsubo' because that's where she lives, and this kind of stuff. Or Murasaki gets called that after a flower, I think, the character. In some translations, they just use these conventional use names as if they're the actual names of the characters. In some translations, they just use descriptions like the original text did, and they don't really refer to characters by even pretend names or use names."
49,48,Lauren,"So, one of them is trying to strive for cultural authenticity, and the other one is trying to just help the poor confused reader a little bit more, and that's choices that each translator has decided to make."
49,49,Gretchen,"Exactly. You also have other types of decisions like, 'Are you going to try to' -- because it's a court drama, you have all these court positions. Are you going try to map those positions onto a western court so that people understand what a chancellor is? Or are you going to try to use those as a more direct translation of what the specific terms were at the time? That's just different decisions that different translations can use."
49,50,Lauren,"When you meet as a book club, is everyone following along, or is there a lot of clarifying across translations? Such an interesting little exercise."
49,51,Gretchen,"Well, the nice thing is, is the division into different chapters is very constant, so we can be like, 'Okay, we're reading Chapters 6 to 10 now. We're gonna talk about what happens in those.' But sometimes you do pull something up, and you're like, 'Okay, so this bit where this thing was said, do we think Genji is kinda misogynistic here?' And somebody will say, 'Well, in my translation, it doesn't actually seem like he's misogynistic.' And here's what's going on in this particular translation versus that particular translation. And how much of it is the translator bringing their own preconceived notions of how people relate to each other? Because some of these translations are from the 1920s or something. People may have had different politics there. And how much of that is in the original text which was composed by a woman who we don't know that much about? But it's the first modern novel. It's an interesting like, 'How much are you going to try to westernise this book for a western audience?' Which some of the older translations do a bit more with the westernisation adaptation because people in the west hadn't heard of Genji very much before. You do all this adaptation for your English-speaking readers. Whereas, more recent translators, people tend to have a higher degree of expectations of fidelity when it comes to a more modern translation. Sometimes they try to do that. And, you know, how many footnotes do you have? How much do you try to explain additionally? How much do you try to just make the text stand on its own as a story?"
49,52,Lauren,So many choices to make as a translator. I'm eternally grateful to people who do this and make it appear so effortless while doing so much work bringing all of this context together.
49,53,Gretchen,"It's really neat. I'm not gonna read this 1,000-page book five different times in five different translations, but being able to experience portions of those translations vicariously through other people talking about, 'Oh, here's what happened in this one, here's what happened in this one,' it does let you do this interesting comparative textual study."
49,54,Lauren,"I've been thinking about translation in practice a lot lately because having worked with P. M. Freestone on their Shadowscent books, 'The Darkets Bloom' and 'Crown of Smoke,' these books have gone into translation in a whole bunch of languages, mostly European languages to date -- Spanish, German, French, Russian, and Polish. I'm very excited about the upcoming Hungarian translation which will the first outside of the Indo-European language. But these translations involve a couple of things that are really interesting in that, in these books, I worked on creating the Aramteskan language, and for this language to work across different languages, sometimes it gets technically transliterated, or you need to add a different type of plural. For example, Russian has a different alphabet to English and so you need to fit this language into the Russian Cyrillic alphabet."
49,55,Gretchen,"You're not trying to pretend that Aramteskan is always written with the Latin alphabet. Even when the book itself is in Russian, you're like, we're gonna transliterate it into Cyrillic?"
49,56,Lauren,"No, translators have very much done what they think is most appropriate. I have a habit of buying these translations now and checking out what they've done because they're not just translating from English into another language, they also have to translate this completely fictional language and this fictional world into that language as well. It's one thing to maybe study in-depth Old English warrior culture or Japanese court culture and decide what to bring across, but with a fantasy world, there's all kinds of choices you have to make as a translator as well."
49,57,Gretchen,"Yeah, like what are you gonna do with the magic system? Or if you've invented all of these words for different scents or something, then they have to figure out some sort of equivalent of inventing those words for the other language."
49,58,Lauren,"There's a lot of scent vocabulary even in the English that P. M. Freestone has written in, so really taxing that part of the translator's repertoire. One thing that's been particularly interesting and that there's been some discussion on how to manage is that in this world, both in the historical part of the world and the contemporary part of the world, the culture and the grammar allow for gender neutral third person like the English modern use of 'they,' which Kirby Conrod gave a great interview about how that works in contemporary English. In fact, I did a little historical evolution of the pronoun system that fits with the story of the world where originally there was no gender distinction in the pronoun system, which fits with the old religious system of the world. And the religious system evolved younger gods that are all gendered, and the pronoun system evolved genders at the same time while still having that scope for gender neutral. Without spoiling too much, but a character that pops up in Book One and is much more a part of Book Two is gender fluid within the world. That works for current English because we have gender neutral singular they, but there are some languages like Czech or like Russian that the book's being translated into where there isn't that flexibility in the linguistic system. So, decisions have to be made about how that is negotiated in the translation."
49,59,Gretchen,Do you know what they did?
49,60,Lauren,"I don't know what they did for Russian yet, but I believe the solution in Czech is at various times this character is overtly identified using masculine and at other times using feminine -- being much more flexible about the duality of their relationship with gender."
49,61,Gretchen,"This reminds me of a thing that I heard Ada Palmer talk about at a conference panel with her book 'Too Like the Lightning' and the sequels, which are set in this far future of English -- well, far future and they're written in English -- in which singular they is used for everybody except when you're writing in this faux-archaic style with 'thous' and 'thees' and 'hes' and 'shes.' It's very marked at that point. Ada Palmer was talking about how this was translated into French where in modern English the progressive thing that people do is like, 'Oh, we can use singular they. That's very progressive.' In modern French, the progressive thing that people do is they make feminine versions of all of the professions."
49,62,Lauren,Right.
49,63,Gretchen,"You have feminine versions of 'professor' or 'doctor' or these kinds of things to try and make the gender more visible. And so erase the gender in the French version wouldn't have the same effect -- where you'd end up using the default masculine or something in the French version -- it wouldn't have the same effect as using singular they all the time in the English version. There are modern French pronouns like 'iel' that have been coined to solve this problem of using a gender neutral third person pronoun, but it wouldn't work to use them in this particular case because the style is supposed to be faux-archaic. What the translator ended up doing was digging out this French pronoun 'on,' which in the modern form 'on' is used like 'we' or like 'one does this.' It's related to like, 'One does this.' There's an older usage of 'on' which is like a non-specific third person pronoun as well that -- I speak French, but I didn't know about this archaic form. And the translator went and looked for what other historic pronoun things could I do and ended up doing with 'on' thing, which is a really interesting adaptation."
49,64,Lauren,"The thing I find interesting is if you were -- 50 years ago, you didn't have the grammatical resources in English to use singular they for a specific person. It's something that's really only emerged in the last couple of decades. I think the translator has felt frustrated to not have -- you know, you sometimes feel like you've got this road block because you don't have resources in one language that you have in another and you have to innovate. I did have a colleague in Italian studies tell me that they read a whole novel once where the gender of one of the characters was deliberately written around and avoided in a way that was an incredibly artful, thoughtful translation. It is possible that you could maybe do this with this character in the Shadowscent books, but it would be such --"
49,65,Gretchen,But you couldn't do it with the whole world in the Terra Ignota books because all of the characters would have to have that.
49,66,Lauren,"Yeah. And you could do that amount of heavy lifting at the cost of some other things, but when you're doing an efficient translation for a commercial novel, you don't have the resources to really max out your art and strategy in that way. It's interesting that, you know, translation is a really resource-intensive activity even to just do a good translation, let alone an incredibly strategic and thoughtful translation."
49,67,Gretchen,"Even translating one word, like that word at the beginning of Beowulf, involves thinking about, 'Okay, what kind of relationship do I want this word to have to the rest of the text? What am I trying to set up here in relationship to the whole text? Where do I see this attention-getting word as going?' Like, what the text as a whole is doing, which is this interesting question. I should say, speaking of translation news, this is very hot off the presses, but I have received news that there are gonna be translations of Because Internet into Persian, Chinese, and Japanese. So, all -- well, Persian is an Indo-European language, but it has a different writing system, and then two non-Indo-European languages. I don't know anything else about the details yet."
49,68,Lauren,This is news that I didn't even know. This is very exciting.
49,69,Gretchen,"It's very recent, yes. It's not -- I dunno. I will have official links when they exist. They won't exist for, I dunno, probably a couple years. I dunno how long it'll take them to do. I know nothing."
49,70,Gretchen,"The surreal thing about translation means that you will see you work and not be able to read it. There's something so amazing and magical about that, that words you have created are finding new audiences -- you know, there's a lot of trust in the translator in those contexts."
49,71,Gretchen,"Yeah, and I don't know if I'm gonna get to have any say in who they get to translate it and how much they know about the internet or things like that."
49,72,Lauren,"Translating non-fiction is an entirely different process because you're not translating an internal narrative world as much as you are potentially translating something that explains how this world that we live in right now exists, or how a set of historical realities existed. That also takes deftness and skill."
49,73,Gretchen,"And you're potentially trying to translate technical vocabulary between one language or another, which isn't necessarily the same as, 'Okay, we need to keep the characters' names consistent. It's like, 'We need to use this word that has a technical meaning in its technical sense.' Speaking of non-fiction translation, I dunno if you've been following in translation news relatively recently, there's been a lot of things going on with the Scots language Wikipedia."
49,74,Lauren,"Yes, I did read about this. So, Scots language is a language in the same family as English. It has a lot of similarities with English but is considered its own 'variety,' using that very deliberate linguist term where you don't commit to just how much it's a dialect or its mutual intelligibility with other varieties that its related to. And it has its own Wikipedia."
49,75,Gretchen,"Scots is kind of like, as an English speaker, I've always been kind of jealous of people who speak Dutch or German or something because they can kind of understand each other a bit. Or Spanish and Portuguese and Italian because they can kind of approximate understanding each other to some extent even if they haven't formally learned the languages. I've always been like, 'Why doesn't English have some closer neighbours?' But I hadn't been thinking about Scots when I was thinking that. Scots is probably English's closest neighbour but is still a distinct language and, especially, there are grammatical differences and there are a lot of political reasons as well why people consider it its own language. However, [laughs] the Scots language Wikipedia, which has all of these articles written in Scots, had apparently been being edited for the last seven years by an American teenager who didn't know any Scots and was just looking up the English articles in a Scots-English dictionary word-by-word and just picking the first word of the translation and subbing that in for the Scots word."
49,76,Lauren,"This has been such a difficult story to read because everyone throughout this process has acted in the best faith. This teenager wasn't doing this for any reason other than a passion for sharing knowledge on Wikipedia and a passion for seeing the Scots Wikipedia grow but with a really uncritical approach to translation. You can see where translation really does require this understanding of vocabulary choice and style choice and how it can all go really, really wrong."
49,77,Gretchen,"Yeah, it's really painful because this person started when they were, like, 12, and we have all believed very foolish things about the world when we were 12. It's just many of us didn't write thousands of Wikipedia articles in a language that is just really not the way anybody who actually speaks this language actually writes because it's cobbled together badly from a dictionary. It's this very painful, 'Oh, no! You thought you were helping.' And yet Wikipedia is used as the basis of a lot of machine translation, and language detection, various natural language processing tools, and so this has been potentially sabotaging the efforts to try to create other machine tools in Scots because they've all been in this weird dictionary-a-fied version of English."
49,78,Lauren,"It's been really heartening to see the Scots language community and the Scottish Wikipedia community come together to figure out a strategy for how to approach cleaning house -- I guess it's the biggest spring clean ever, right -- how to approach this, like, thousands and thousands of articles with this very strange approach to translation."
49,79,Gretchen,"It illuminates one of the issues with smaller language Wikipedias in general which is that they may only have a few active editors because to be a Wikipedia editor is to be a volunteer. It takes a long time to translate things or to write articles. If you're a language like English, you can have tens of thousands of editors. But if you're a language like Scots which has many fewer speakers, you may only have a dozen active editors of which maybe one of them is a well-meaning but very clueless American teenager."
49,80,Lauren,We've both done lots of Wikipedia editing. We have run LingWiki events to improve linguistics content on Wikipedia. It's challenging enough to write these articles in one language that I am proficient in. I'm always in awe of people who choose to translate and support content in their second or third languages because it is a non-trivial task to translate really complicated information in a way that is really clear.
49,81,Gretchen,"Translation is a technical task that is one of those things that looks at all of the different levels of language where you have some things at the individual word, or even sound, or if you're trying to translate poetry and you wanna make it beautiful in a very aesthetic sense with the physical properties of language, all the way up to words and sentences and structure and these discourse-y particles like 'Hwaet' at the beginning where you're trying to picture a whole framing device for the structure of an entire tone of a narrative. Or if you're trying to pick, 'Okay, how are we going to treat technical vocabulary that maybe has been borrowed from English?' because its scientific vocabulary that was invented from English, how are you gonna treat that when it gets borrowed into Scots? Trying to figure out how to make these technical decisions is non-trivial. It's this very interesting train wreck. It can go spectacularly right when you have this very clever decision for a dragon to put the world on blast, and it can also go spectacularly wrong when you just say, 'Okay, I'm gonna look through a dictionary and then pick the first word I encounter.'"
49,82,Lauren,"One of the great things about appreciating a good translation is that language never takes a break. Culture continues to change, and we move further away from the era of Beowulf. We move into new cultural settings and new cultural expectations. It means that there is space for new translations that bring new approaches, or try something different, or aim for really capturing something about the language of the era it was created in, or set an old story in a radically new setting. Even when you find a really satisfying translation, you know there's still possibilities for finding other interesting ways to engage with the text."
49,83,Gretchen,"I think that's a thing that's exciting about both the translations of these thousand-year-old texts, whether Beowulf or Tale of Genji, where they go through lots of different authors who put their own spin on the translation. And also thinking of Wikipedia as a place for translation where you have multiple authors working together on the same shared text, and a bunch of different people -- like Scots Wikipedia has been having these Wikipedia edit-a-thons to try to clean the place up. You have a whole bunch of contributors that are finding out about this need because of this story and coming in and working on the text together and contributing to the shared text. In many ways, even though each of these editions of the translations are published as their own book for book-length ones, it's this very intimate relationship that you can have with a text when you're trying to render it in a different language or in a different textual interpretation.

50,1,Gretchen,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics! I'm Gretchen McCulloch."
50,2,Lauren,"I'm Lauren Gawne. Today, we're getting enthusiastic about sonority. But first, Happy Anniversary Lingthusiasm Month."
50,3,Gretchen,"Happy Anniversary, Lauren!"
50,4,Lauren,"Happy Anniversary, Gretchen! It's been four years of Lingthusiasm."
50,5,Gretchen,"Which is kind of amazing. We launched with three episodes in December 2016, but we celebrate the anniversary in November because we were recording them in advance."
50,6,Lauren,It's also our 50th main episode. Those couple of extra episodes that we launched with explain why it's not something divisible by 12. We're so excited to hit our 50th episode of main Lingthusiasm episodes in our anniversary month.
50,7,Gretchen,"It's a nice round number for another nice round number. Thank you to everybody who has already shared a link to your favourite episode or just your excitement about Lingthusiasm in honour of our anniversary. There's still another week to do that within our anniversary month. Of course, we welcome this all year round as well. Most people still find podcasts through word of mouth, and a lot of people don't yet realise they could be having a fun linguistics chat in their ears every month -- or in their eyes because all our episodes also have transcripts."
50,8,Lauren,"As with every year at our anniversary in particular, we're asking you to help us connect with people who would be totally interested in a linguistics podcast if only they knew lingthusiasm existed."
50,9,Gretchen,"We've done this call for extra sharing of the Lingthusiasm every year on our anniversary, and we always see in the stats that your recommendations really do help more people find the show. If you share it on social media, tag us. We'll reply. We'll like your tweet. We'll try to reshare it on our Instagram story and whatever else is applicable. Or if you just send it to one person in private, we won't know about it, but you can feel a warm glow of satisfaction. Feel free to tell us about it on social media if you wanna be thanked."
50,10,Lauren,"As well as our 50 main episodes, we have over 45 bonus episodes at patreon.com/lingthusiasm. Our latest episode is a behind-the-scenes chat about writing the scripts for the Crash Course Linguistics series where we had Jessi Grieser along who was also part of that team."
50,11,Gretchen,"If you're looking for even more linguistics, we have also been co-writing the scripts for this big educational YouTube channel, which is Crash Course. If you want to watch some videos about linguistics as well and know that we were behind the words that the host is saying on those scripts, we're really excited to share those as well and to get to share a bit of behind-the-scenes."
50,12,Lauren,"You now have the option on Patreon to support at an annual level rather than at a monthly level of support. You can also choose from a range of currencies now, so there are some more options there. Annual subscriptions make a great last-minute gift if you're still thinking about something for the holiday season for yourself or for someone else."
50,13,Gretchen,"Of course, lingthusiasm merch and copies of Because Internet , now in paperback, also make great gifts, although you'll have to keep an eye on timing for whether they can be shipped in time. Digital gifts are also great. [Music]"
50,14,Gretchen,"Lauren, I've been getting really into crossword puzzles lately."
50,15,Lauren,That is a wholesome hobby to have.
50,16,Gretchen,"I feel like it's just one of those things you do on your phone a bit mindlessly. Crossword puzzles always make me think about the way that individual letters -- English letters -- can combine with each other in particular patterns. Because you're trying to fill in a particular range of words, and you're like, 'That has to be a vowel there,' or like, 'That could be a vowel or an R or an L.' There's only so many things that could in this slot when you're trying to guess the words you don't know."
50,17,Lauren,"My grandpa taught me to do crossword puzzles, and I feel like I had a really good appreciation for what made an English consonant cluster well before I studied linguistics and learnt about things like syllables and phonotactics, which is the fancy way of saying 'syllable structure.'"
50,18,Gretchen,"Yeah. And it's not just, you know, okay, I wanna cheat at Scrabble, or I wanna like, okay, what if I came up with some --"
50,19,Lauren,"If you wanna cheat, you want to optimise your ability to play Scrabble based on your linguistic analysis abilities."
50,20,Gretchen,"I think in many cases word games like crossword puzzles or Scrabble are often the ways people think about, okay, which things are more likely to be at the beginning of a syllable or at the end of a syllable, or which kinds of combinations like, 'Oh, I've got an S and a T and an R here. Maybe I can make a word that begins with /stɹ/.' But I'm not gonna be able to make a word that begins with like /ltɹs/. Those sorts of things, at a very broad level, are also the kinds of things that linguists think about when it comes to which types of syllable structures are characteristics of some languages and which ones aren't."
50,21,Lauren,"We've talked about the International Phonetic Alphabet before -- and bits and pieces of it including just specifically the vowels. The International Phonetic Alphabet is this way of representing all of the possible sounds in human spoken languages. There's something about this chart, like the 'Periodic Table of Sounds,' it all seems very -- all sounds are equal, all sounds have a set of properties, and they're all just there. But when we actually look at how sounds are put together in speech, we find that not all sounds necessarily exist in the same spaces."
50,22,Gretchen,"There's a sense in which there are certain things you can do with certain sounds, at least in English, if we start with English, and then there're things you don't do with them any other way. If we think about words in English can begin with groups of consonants like B-R, B-L, K-R, K-L, G-L, G-R, D-R. You can often have this R or L in the second position at the beginning of a word. The inverse isn't in the case. At the beginning of a word you don't have like, R-B or L-L or L-B."
50,23,Lauren,I like that your brain is actually struggling to even articulate these examples.
50,24,Gretchen,"L-G. Because I'm trying to move them in my head as I'm doing them. You have a word in English like 'trust' or 'trend' which has T-R at the beginning, but you don't have 'rtuts' or 'rtedn.' I can't even -- like, I have to say that with three syllables -- /ɹə/ /tɛd/ /n̩/ -- not 'tennr.' Or you have something like 'plant' but not 'lpatn.'"
50,25,Lauren,What is a possible combination and order at the start of a word is different to what's a possible combination and order at the end of a word. We talked about this in our episode on syllables.
50,26,Gretchen,"What's interesting is that they kind of mirror each other. You have something like R-D at the end of a word or at the end of a syllable, or you can have D-R at the beginning, and in both cases, it's the D that's kind of on either side of the outskirts and the R that's closer towards the centre -- closer towards the vowel in the middle."
50,27,Lauren,I guess like 'clean' and 'milk' that /kl/ and then that /lk/ at the beginning and the end.
50,28,Gretchen,"Yeah. There's this weird thing that I've always found particularly peculiar about English where English for some reason doesn't like having the same cluster at both the beginning and end at of the same syllable. So, 'clean' and 'milk,' as you said, totally fine, but if you try to say like 'klilk' --"
50,29,Lauren,/klɪ/?
50,30,Gretchen,/klɪlk/.
50,31,Lauren,/klɪ/ -- I keep wanting to say 'click.'
50,32,Gretchen,"Or 'klelk.' It's somehow weirdly bad even though all of the constituent pieces are fine. It just -- /klɛlk/. I mean, if you wanna make an alien language that's still easy enough for English speakers to pronounce but sounds very distinctly un-English-y, that is one of your tickets to do that."
50,33,Lauren,Mirroring sounds at the beginning and end of the syllable. I'll keep that in mind for the next weird conlang I have to create.
50,34,Gretchen,"You notice this sort of mirroring thinking, 'Okay, well, L is always happier' -- you can have something that just begins with L and has nothing else, right. But this is in cases where you have complex consonant clusters. The L is always happier nearer the middle of the word -- nearer with middle of the syllable. We're just dealing with single syllable words because it's more straightforward to look at them that way because you know all of the sounds have to belong to the same syllable if the word only has one syllable. Then K is happier on the outskirts. You can think of it like there's a mountain, right, you know, you have the vowel is the peak of your mountain, and then on either side you have -- so L is halfway down in both cases, and then K is down in two different valleys on either side. You start in the valley with one K, you go up to L, and you go up to the vowel, whatever it is, and then you can go back down to like, here's an L or an R or something, and then you're back down with K and P and B and all of those letters."
50,35,Lauren,The kinds of letters that hang out at different altitudes on our little mountain walk have similar properties. Maybe we should go for a little hike. Shall we start maybe at the top of the hill? Or get helicoptered in? Or maybe take a chair lift?
50,36,Gretchen,Let's pretend we've gotten teleported in to the top of the mountain.
50,37,Lauren,Which is where our vowels hang out -- vowels having the particular property in how they're produced that you don't close off anything in your squishy meat tube to produce a vowel. You can change the shape of it. That's why we have different vowels. But it's just a continuous airflow situation.
50,38,Gretchen,"'Squishy meat tube' being the technical term for 'vocal tract.' [Laughter] Vowels are a kind of thing that if you're gonna have something in the middle of a syllable, it's most likely to be a vowel."
50,39,Lauren,"If you only have one thing in a syllable, it tends to be a vowel."
50,40,Gretchen,"It tends to be a vowel. It's not always a vowel. You can say, 'Hm,' and there's just an M hanging out being a syllable by itself. That's not a vowel. But for the most part, at least in English, interjections like 'Hm' and 'Shhh' and stuff like that, those don't have to have vowels in them. But there aren't a lot of words that do this. So, you can have a word like 'Hm' in English, but I you have 'Ahh' and 'Mmm' together in a single word, the 'Ahh' is gonna grab the syllable spot first."
50,41,Lauren,And then descending downhill from vowels.
50,42,Gretchen,"Some of the stuff involved in making diphthongs -- if you wanna make something like /oɪ/ -- /oːi/ -- that's like, 'Oh, you've got two --a vowel and also a vowel-ish thing that you can still clump in with the vowel.' I think that'd be our next step down."
50,43,Lauren,"Still very, very open and easy to sing, I guess, is a feature of this openness."
50,44,Gretchen,"Yeah, your mouth is very open. There's a lot of air still going though. It's easy to sing. And now you've got your L and your R and other kind of L and R like sounds. Different languages do different things with the sounds we think of as L and R like."
50,45,Lauren,These are a really fun catch all category. We may have to talk about R sounds one day.
50,46,Gretchen,"We have to do a whole episode about Ls and/or Rs because there's a whole lot going on with them. They still have a fair bit of openness. You can think of /laaa/, /llllll/. There's still a fair bit of air leaving your mouth while you're making /llllll/. You can try it and really confuse the people around you. That's the next step down the mountain. I feel like we're now in mountain goat territory rather than snow caps or something. I don't know how mountains work."
50,47,Lauren,We're definitely near the treeline.
50,48,Gretchen,"Okay. You know much more about mountains than I do. Then you've got your /m/ and /n/, all of your nasal sounds that you've got a certain amount of closure in your mouth, but your nose is making up for it."
50,49,Lauren,Still fun sing-y sounds if you hum along to some music.
50,50,Gretchen,"Still extremely hum-able. Then you've got your sounds that you can still say by themselves like /ʃ/ and /s/ and /f/ and /z/ and stuff like this. You can still say them by themselves without another vowel to come along helping them. And you can think about this -- if you have 'freeze,' you have F and then R, and you're heading up the mountain towards the middle vowel and then heading back down with the /z/. You can go through and think about, okay, what's a bunch of monosyllabic English words with multiple consonants at the beginning or end? How can I re-constructure myself which bits should be on which parts of the scale?"
50,51,Lauren,Another example from when were talking before about meat tubes would be 'flesh.' [Laughter]
50,52,Gretchen,"Then finally you've got your Ps and Bs and /k/, /g/, /t/, /d/ really hanging out at the bottom where you can't make these without fully closing off the mouth for at least a split second."
50,53,Lauren,"In fact, the only way we can really tell which sound you're making very easily is because you stick a vowel there to help us hear the difference between a /p/ and a /t/."
50,54,Gretchen,"This is a thing that really blew my mind when I was learning about sounds like this where you fully close off the air is that what's actually going on here is your just hearing silence. Your brain is like, 'Oh, no, you're hearing a P' because it makes the following vowel P-like. But actually what's there when you feel like you're making it is just this brief split second of silence. You can see it show up on a wave form, but there's nothing coming out."
50,55,Lauren,"It's a very exciting, very dynamic little valley that we're in -- all these stop-y sounds"
50,56,Gretchen,"These nice little staccatos popping off like firecrackers or something. You think you could put your firecrackers on the top of the mountains so people could see them better, but that's not what our metaphor's doing."
50,57,Lauren,That's not how this metaphor's going at all.
50,58,Gretchen,"Well, you could think, well, what if we put those firecracker-y explosive sounds at a top of a different metaphorical mountain? But one thing that's also relevant is that this is also a degree of loudness. You can make the sounds at the top of the mountain louder than you can make the sounds at the bottom."
50,59,Lauren,"So, it's partly about the openness and how easy they are to sing, but there's also something to do with loudness happening here."
50,60,Gretchen,"Well, and I think when your mouth is more open, you can be more loud with it. If you think about if you need to scream, you're not gonna scream like /sss/. [Laughter] Or if you're trying to really do some vocal warm up exercises, you're gonna be like /aaa/ or something. You're not gonna be like --"
50,61,Lauren,/pə pə pə pə pə pə pə/.
50,62,Gretchen,"I mean, I guess you could do that. That is true."
50,63,Lauren,But that's really the vowel happening there not the /p/.
50,64,Gretchen,"It's not /p p p p p p p/. If you're trying to be really loud or really project, you're doing that with the vowels and the ones that are closer up on the vowel mountain. If you think about the mountain as a loudness amplitude mountain, the louder stuff is on top."
50,65,Lauren,"All these different points along our walk down the mountain have been visiting different ways that we use the mechanics of the mouth to make sounds, which is something that linguists refer to as 'manner of articulation.' It's one of those features that's represented in the International Phonetic Alphabet."
50,66,Gretchen,"And the International Phonetic Alphabet kind of does the inverse metaphor where they put the most closed ones at the top and then they go gradually down until the most open ones. You have to kind of flip it upside down to get the mountain, but they're still doing this sounds exist on a continuum from how open or how closed or how singable or how unsingable they are. That's relevant not just in terms of, okay, how can we describe them, but in terms of how can we put a word together? What happens when you're trying to put a syllable together? Languages tend to have this preference which shows up across a lot of different languages for making a syllable that has one mountain top and its peak, even if it doesn't contain absolutely every single point along that path because that would probably be too heavy of a syllable for most purposes. But if you're gonna pick stuff from along that path, you're gonna do that in a particular order. This comes in handy when you're trying to make up plausible non-words as well. So, 'blick' is a plausible non-word in English. It's not really a word as far as I know, but it could be. Someone could have a start-up called 'Blick,' and you'd be like, 'Ah, yeah. That's a thing.'"
50,67,Lauren,I think it's the word for 'blink' in German.
50,68,Gretchen,"Oh, yeah! I think it is -- like in 'Augenblick.'"
50,69,Lauren,Which is always why it's very good to double check if your nonsense words in one language are in fact nonsense words in another language if you're expanding your analysis.
50,70,Gretchen,"Yeah, if you're starting up a start-up. I don't think that's offensive to German speakers, but you do wanna double check these things."
50,71,Lauren,You do wanna check.
50,72,Gretchen,"Yeah. Whereas something like 'lbick' has that L-B in the other order, and suddenly you're like, 'Hmm.'"
50,73,Lauren,"'Blick' isn't a word, but 'lbick' is like very not a word in English. I feel, even with my limited knowledge of sounds in German, I feel confident that it's not a word in German either."
50,74,Gretchen,With my slightly greater but still not particularly good knowledge of German I also feel very confident in saying this. But you can use it to create plausible non-words versus implausible non-words.
50,75,Lauren,That's because those stop-y sounds are right in the valley at the edge of our little peak of sounds that we toured.
50,76,Gretchen,"You'd be starting midway up the mountain, and then you'd be going down and then back up again. That's just not a thing that languages like to do. They wanna do a smooth path."
50,77,Lauren,Languages are like me when it comes to climbing a mountain -- trying to do it with as little effort as possible.
50,78,Gretchen,"Well, but I actually think this is an effort thing not just in a metaphorical sense, right, because it is an openness of the mouth, and if you think about humans trying to conserve energy in terms of pronouncing things, it's easier to do a smoother motion of like, my mouth is closed, and then it's somewhat open, and then it's really open, and then it's somewhat closed, and then it's closed again. That's a smoother thing for humans to do gradually over hundreds and thousands of years to actually produce."
50,79,Lauren,"We have these preferences for sure, yeah."
50,80,Gretchen,"It's not as much effort as climbing a mountain, but if you're talking for hours and hours, it would pay off. Another example that's in the interestingly non-word spectrum is you could have something like 'bnick.' How do you feel about 'bnick' as a non-word?"
50,81,Lauren,"Is it the name of a dish from a language other than English that is gonna be really tasty and I'm gonna love it? It's not the worst non-word, but it's not something I recognise."
50,82,Gretchen,"Right. It's somewhere between 'blick' and 'lbick' on the spectrum of like, okay, this doesn't sound like it's an English word. It could've been a word that was borrowed into English from a different language because it still sounds like maybe some language had this as a word, versus 'lbick' -- if I make it two syllables, it's obviously fine. You can be like /l̩/ /bɪk/. Sure, that could be a word. But /lbɪk/, where I'm really trying to make them into one syllable, that one somehow, like, I don't know if any language does this or, if they do, it would be a language that I would have a lot of difficulty even learning how to pronounce. Whereas if I'm told like, oh, some language has this word 'bnick,' I'm like, 'Oh, okay. Well, I could learn how to produce that pretty easily.'"
50,83,Lauren,"Again, our stop-y B sound is further down the mountain than the nasal /n/ sound there, so it fits within this pattern as well."
50,84,Gretchen,"Exactly. It's a pattern that seems to show up similarly but also differently. Oh, that's a specific way of saying things. In many different languages, there seems to be a general contour of a mountain here with vowels at the middle and things along the way that seems to apply to a lot of languages, but different languages do different things with how many places they let you pause along the mountain and pick something else up or how close those can be to each other -- things like that."
50,85,Lauren,"This property of sounds that changes from the top of our mountain all the way down is known in phonetics as 'sonority' because the sounds at the top of the mountain are considered to be more sonorous, and then you have less sonorous sounds and less sonority as you go down the mountain."
50,86,Gretchen,"Or sometimes people talk about the ones that are in the top half of the mountain as being 'sonorants' -- and the M and N, your nasals and above, are sonorants -- and then your /ʃ/ and /s/ and /f/ and below are non-sonorants or 'obstruents.' I think maybe linguists got tired of saying, 'Well, it's kind of singable, and its kind of how open your mouth is, it's kind of like this thing. What if we gave this property a name, and we called it 'sonorants' even though' -- sonority is one of those really interesting concepts to me because when you first encounter it, you're like, 'Wow! This explains everything!' And then you encounter more languages, or you go to grad school, or something, and then you're like, 'Oh, no. This doesn't make sense at all. This explains nothing. Every language does it slightly differently. Maybe it doesn't exist.' It can exist in both of those states at once where you're like, on the one hand, this does actually seem to account for some stuff and, on the other hand, the details of how you wanna implement it can get really complicated really quickly."
50,87,Lauren,"It is quite a squishy phenomenon. As you said, we can just categorise things as sonorants and non-sonorants. Then other people will do a really, really split-y analysis, and they'll put sounds like /b/ and /g/ further up their little mountain than /p/ and /k/. We've just put all of our stop sounds at the very bottom of the valley, and other people will even try and split them up even further which for some languages and for some analyses makes a lot of sense, but we're going to stick with a more broad categorisation, I think."
50,88,Gretchen,"Right. You could try to split up your L-like sounds and your R-like sounds. For some languages, it might be useful to do this. Or you could split up F and S or something like this, or S and Z -- or /z/. Again, for some languages, you're like, 'Oh, yeah, we really need to do it here.' It's still kind of useful as a general property to say, well, the difference between these two groups of sounds seems to be sonority. Yet, for other languages, you're like, 'Naw, we can just lump them all together,' and they don't really make a difference between them. It's this interestingly slippery thing where, on the one hand, it probably exists because it does account for a bunch of stuff and, on the other hand, different languages seem to care about it to different degrees."
50,89,Lauren,"When it comes to sonority, I don't think there's anything more slippery than the /s/ sound. It really illustrates how challenging it can be to work with sonority sometimes. S has this property -- and it's not just in English, it's across a range of languages -- where it is somewhere further up in our sonority hierarchy than stops, but it can occur outside of stops in our little consonant syllable set up. A word like 'strong' or 'splint' where we would expect something like a T or a P sound to be on the very outside, based on our mountain climbing metaphor, but the S sits outside of that."
50,90,Gretchen,"I think when I first encountered this, I was like, 'Look! S seems to be very clearly maybe below the Ts and Ps and so on. Why can't we just put it below?' But the problem is it's literally just S. It's not any of the other sounds that are produced in a similar manner as S like /z/ or /f/ or /θ/ or /ð/ or all of these. They all seem to very happily behave like their cousins at this mid-level where you can do something like /pf/ -- not so much in English, but you can do it in some languages. In German, you can have 'Pfennig,' which is the old word for 'penny,' which has a P-F at the beginning. Or in Greek you can do /ks/ or /ps/ like 'psychology.' There're lots of reasons to be like, oh, yeah, well, S seems to belong to this class of things, on the one hand, which is between -- it's definitely also the case you can do /sn/ like 'snore' or 'sneeze' or something like this. So, it should be below the nasals and it should be above the stops. It seems like is should belong to this category, and yet it's also this massive exception that you can do all sorts of weird stuff with."
50,91,Lauren,I like it. It's a free spirit.
50,92,Gretchen,"Both at the beginning and the end. You can do stuff like 'strong' or 'splint' at the beginning of a word, but you can also do a word like 'tents' where the N and then T, okay, we're at the bottom of the mountain and like, where the heck did this S come from? Why are you here? It's this really interesting sound that you can do all sorts of stuff with. But the neat thing about talking about S in terms of sonority even though S kind of breaks sonority is that it has this exceptional behaviour in several languages -- in a variety of languages that aren't necessarily related to each other in that sort of way. Not all of them. In some languages, S is a well-behaved citizen and isn't exceptional. In Latin, for example, S also has this exceptional behaviour. You have a Latin word like 'scola.' And then in many of the Romance languages that descended from Latin -- but not Italian -- many of the other Romance languages, Spanish and French and so on, they were like, 'No, we don't wanna start treating S as exceptional. We're gonna put it back on its best behaviour, and we're gonna introduce a vowel to grab onto the S instead so that it's not being an exception.' That's why you get words like 'escuela' where that S belongs to the vowel before it. You can see this question of like, 'Does this language make an exception for S or not,' is relevant across languages. It's an interesting parameter that languages can vary on -- even related languages."
50,93,Lauren,"I like how much sonority is providing motivation for quite a few of the examples we talked about in our syllables episode because it is one of those things that once you begin to see it pop it, it explains or it hangs out in the space of a lot of the ordering phenomena that we looked at for that episode."
50,94,Gretchen,"It was an interesting challenge in the syllables episode to not talk about sonority because we thought, okay, we should introduce one thing at a time. But also sonority is intimately tied up with how do we make syllables and what does a particular language think of as a syllable and not a syllable. In English, one thing that's the case is when you're climbing up the sonority mountain, think of it like a video game, and you have a certain number of slots to hold things in, but you need to wait a bit before you pick up something new because you don't just get to keep picking up everything all the way even though it's all on the way. If you pick up, let's say, a P, you can't also pick up a T at the same time while you're down there. English is like, 'Naw uh, we don't have any more slots until we get a bit further up.' But in Greek, you can pick up a P and a T at the same time because it's got a different video game metaphor holding system -- not that the language thinks of it that way, but you know."
50,95,Lauren,"It's operating with different constraints, absolutely."
50,96,Gretchen,"It's operating with different constraints. In Greek, you get words like 'pter,' which refers to a wing -- it's a root that means 'wing' -- which shows up in words like 'helicopter' -- 'helico-pter.' In Greek, 'pter' is a totally good beginning of a syllable. You see it in words like 'PUH-terodactyl,' which English speakers don't pronounce that way because English doesn't let you do that. Or 'PUH-tolemy' which, again, English speakers don't pronounce that way -- /tɑləmi/ or /tɛɹədæktl̩/. Some languages will let you say, 'Okay, well, yeah, you can pick up several things at the same spot.' And other languages will say, 'No, you have to wait a bit and wait till you get a couple more steps up before you can pick up something new.' Russian lets you pick up things that are a little bit closer to each other. You can have a word that begins with /ks/ in Russian or /vl/. V-L is a really interesting one because there're kinda sorta some English words that begin with V-L, but it's just not very common, and English speakers don't always really like it. You have 'vlog,' but a lot of English speakers would pronounce that a little bit closer to 'blog' or like /vəlɑg/."
50,97,Lauren,/vəlɑg/
50,98,Gretchen,"And you can have /fl/ like 'fly,' 'flea,' 'flim-flam.' You got lots of /fl/s in English. /vl/ is just a little bit like you can kinda do it, but you can't quite put your finger on why it doesn't feel very common."
50,99,Lauren,"If I had a crossword puzzle that was 'blank L blank blank,' I would not be reaching for a V at the start of that word. Straight up. Absolutely."
50,100,Gretchen,"No, it would not be what you'd be inclined to go for. You sometimes see English speakers pronouncing 'vlog' like /vəlɑg/ just to make it a little bit easier. Or with Russian names like 'Vlad,' saying it /vəlæd/ just to make it a little bit easier to do that. Because that one's like it's kind of there. In English it's a little bit marginal -- similar to 'bnick' where you can kind of do it in English, but it's a little bit difficult for you because it's not something that the language does a lot."
50,101,Lauren,I would uncharitably suggest that part of the reason we don't talk about vlogs anymore is because they feel awkward to say as English speakers. That's why we talk about 'YouTube channels.'
50,102,Gretchen,I think it might be.
50,103,Lauren,I really didn't think far ahead with my 'bnick' vlog.
50,104,Gretchen,You're gonna be a 'bnick' blogger?
50,105,Lauren,Really just making it not entirely wrong but slightly awkward for English speakers.
50,106,Gretchen,"I mean, I will say that we have a pretty phonotactically weird cluster in the name of our podcast."
50,107,Lauren,This is true.
50,108,Gretchen,"We're finally admitting it four years in -- like, /lɪŋ/ /θʊziæzm̩/. They belong to different syllables, but they're just done with such distinct places in the mouth that people have a really hard time saying our name. We didn't think that through."
50,109,Lauren,Different places and different manners. There's a little bit of stuff that I've read about the influence of sonority preferences across syllables. We meet the requirement. Normally you have something that's more sonorous at the end of the first syllable than at the beginning of the second syllable. We got that bit good.
50,110,Gretchen,"Okay. So, we've got /ŋ/ at the first syllable and then /θ/ at the next one, but they're just one away from each other kind of. They're not that far."
50,111,Lauren,"On the topic of names in the show, Gretchen."
50,112,Gretchen,"Well, it's interesting -- and I can also sometimes tell when people have said the name 'Gretchen' a lot because, for me, I tend to reduce that final E-N to just /n/ -- /gɹɛt͡ʃn̩/. People who aren't as familiar with the name will tend to give it a full vowel -- /gɹɛt͡ʃɛn/. It's not that one of them is wrong because English has this interesting continuum where sometimes we produce syllables that just have a sonorant like M or N or L or R by itself as if it's the only thing in that syllable or as if it's the centre of that syllable -- the nucleus of that syllable -- instead of there actually being a vowel there. You just say, 'Here's a syllable that's just consonant centric.'"
50,113,Lauren,"Even though vowels are at the top of our sonority mountain, and you usually expect to find a vowel hanging out in the middle of any syllable party, it's not always the case. We can have one of our other sonorant sounds being the 'syllable boss.' Is that out official terminology?"
50,114,Gretchen,"If you have words like /bʔn̩/, /bɑtl̩/, /pɹɪzm̩/, even /rɪðm̩/, where is the vowel? No? Okay, no vowel. Okay, fine. Sure. Sometimes you don't go all the way up the mountain, you just got up to a certain point, and you're like, 'Yeah, that's fine. I'm gonna go back down.'"
50,115,Lauren,"It's interesting that some like /bʌtən/, when I pronounce them with clear, full articulation, I put a vowel there. But I'm pretty sure that if I was just --"
50,116,Gretchen,/bʌtɑn/.
50,117,Lauren,"/bʌtn̩/, /bʌtɪn/? But if I was just talking about how I had to press all these /bʔn̩z/ really quickly -- there you go. If I force myself into unmonitored speech, I'd just pronounce it as an /n̩/ syllable -- or a 'syllabic nasal.' It's interesting how for some of them we only do it as a reduction thing, but then for /pɹɪzm̩/, I don't think -- there might be a tiny vowel-ish thing there."
50,118,Gretchen,"If you're really trying to spell it out, like 'Go get the /pɹɪzɪm/,' you could maybe put a vowel there. But I think it would really sound like you were hyper articulating that. Whereas /bɑtəl/, you could say it with a full vowel there, and it would be fine."
50,119,Lauren,"In English, they have this semi-autonomous sonorant non-vowel syllable status, but it's not necessarily the case for all languages. There are some languages where you do get these vowelless syllables fairly frequently and centrally."
50,120,Gretchen,"It kind of makes you want to check in on English in 500 years, which obviously we are all gonna be around for, because maybe by that point this casual speech/unmonitored speech/rapid speech pronunciation will just be how it is, and English will have this full featured set of like, 'Oh, yeah, these are just our syllabic consonants that -- nobody ever says /bʌtən/. That sounds so weird. Everyone says /bʔn̩/ all the time.' Because that's how language change happens, right. There're are some languages that don't have syllabic consonants at all, and there're some languages that do a whole lot more with syllabic consonants. Two famous languages when it comes to syllables without vowels in them -- both of them are languages that have been known by multiple names in their history. One of them is a language that has been known as 'Berber.' Speakers aren't particularly fond of that name anymore. There are several different dialects or varieties, and there are different names for different varieties of those. It still sometimes shows up in the literature as like, 'Oh, Berber has vowelless syllables,' and I'm not sure which of all these varieties -- if they all have syllables that don't have vowels in them or entire words that don't have vowels, or if there're some that do and some that don't. That's something that's been left unclear by the change in naming convention through the literature."
50,121,Lauren,"Interesting. I have heard people talk about 'Berber,' and it is good to know I have to mentally update my name for that language."
50,122,Gretchen,"Tashlhiyt is the variety of Berber that's been talked about most in terms of having vowelless syllables. I knew some Amazigh speakers once, and I don't know if they had vowelless syllables as well because I didn't know them that well. But they definitely prefer to be called 'Amazigh' rather than 'Berber.' It's an interesting, not knowing much about the typology of this language family, whether this is something that's true of the whole macro group of languages or just of Tashlhiyt. I'm honestly not sure."
50,123,Lauren,These languages are spoken in Morocco and that part of the Northern African region.
50,124,Gretchen,"And then in another part of the world, another language that's often cited as a language that has syllables without vowels at all or words without vowels is Nuxalk, which is a Salishan language spoken in British Columbia in Canada. So, obviously very different parts of the world. I think several of the Salishan languages may also have not a lot of vowels going on, but the one that I've heard being cited is called Nuxalk. It's in some older literature as 'Bella Coola,' but speakers prefer 'Nuxalk.'"
50,125,Lauren,"Cool. So, it's not just a thing that pops up in edge cases but is a central feature of how these languages make syllables."
50,126,Gretchen,"Yeah. And they do have some vowels elsewhere. The words that tend to get attention are the ones that have lots of consonants. There's one very famous example from Nuxalk which is translated, 'Then he had had in his possession a bunchberry plant.' This is a language where you can make what would be a full sentence in some languages you can make into a single word. I'm definitely not gonna do this justice, so we can link to that and maybe hopefully find an audio clip where someone has actually pronounced it properly. It's got over a dozen sounds in it. When you're talking about theories of syllabification, it's not just, 'Okay, it's got the syllabic /n/ or syllabic /l/,' which is somewhat straightforward, but they also make syllables around sounds like /s/ or /ʃ/ or other types of fricative based sounds where you have, okay, this could also be the centre of a syllable. You're really not going very far up the sonority mountain at all."
50,127,Lauren,"One of those really wonderful examples of crafting a slightly absurd sentence for the most linguistically rewarding possible outcome, in this case."
50,128,Gretchen,"That's definitely what the bunchberry plant example is, yes. When I first encountered this in grad school this like, 'Oh, you can make syllables that're based around things that aren't vowels and things that aren't even necessarily sonorants,' it was kind of hard for me to wrap my head around, but then I was also thinking about, well, we have semi-words or fixed interjections like 'Psst' and 'Shhh' and stuff like that in English where you do end up producing what you would write as P-S-S-T or S-H-H-H or something like that. You're write that without any vowels, and you'd say it without any vowels, it's just that we don't build other syllables and other words around it. In terms of actually producing it, it's not particularly difficult. Any English speaker is able to produce things along those lines. It's an interesting example of how something can be presented in a way that makes it exotified and then also has this very hum drum local existence that isn't necessarily brought out when you first get exposed to an example like that."
50,129,Lauren,"Sonority doesn't just pop up while we're talking about the structure of syllables. I also ran into our old friend sonority while analysing the way that tone is done in Yolmo. Like many other languages in the world, the difference between some words is a difference in the tone of the word. A word with high tone like /tó/ or a low tone like /tò/. They have the same consonant and the same vowel. They only differ by tone. /tó/ is 'rice' and /tò/ is 'stone.' Obviously, even for someone who is not always good at producing tone, like me, people generally knew if I wanted to eat more rice and didn't try and give me stones because people are very accommodating."
50,130,Gretchen,"They were nice, yeah."
50,131,Lauren,"But not all of the sounds in the language have high and low tones. Some only have high and some only have low. The ones that do have both are those that begin with -- or are only vowels or laterals or rhotics or nasals and also our fricative S. So, almost everything that has high and low tone are relatively high up the sonority mountain. Of course, from then on it all gets a bit messier. You also get /k/ and /tɕ/ in there as well. Then you only get low tone on your voiced /z/ and /g/ and /dʑ/ and high on your very aspirate /kʰ/ and /tɕʰ/ and /l̥/. But overall, friend sonority just kind of pops by and says hello."
50,132,Gretchen,"The stuff that's more sonorous has more tone options, and for the stuff that's less sonorous, it's either one or the other -- as a very broad generalisation of how you split off that one or the other."
50,133,Lauren,"Depends on some other factors, yeah."
50,134,Gretchen,But sonority is a piece of that puzzle?
50,135,Lauren,"Yeah. The tone system came out of some older consonant clusters. Like English has lots of cluster-y sounds. You get fewer of those in these Tibetan languages as they're spoken today. That's what the tone system came out of. It could just be a bit of a coincidence that this reduction in the consonant clusters and the current sonority play out in the tone system. But I mean, this is the thing about sonority -- it pops up and is part of the explanation of things, but then there're lots of other historical or contextual factors in each specific language that also are in play."
50,136,Gretchen,"Right! On the one hand, you wanna be like, 'Look, sonority, its kind of fake because you have these languages with vowelless syllables and you have languages that don't pay attention to it and do it in all sorts of different ways,' and then sometimes --"
50,137,Lauren,And you have S in English.
50,138,Gretchen,"And you have S in English, which is like, who knows. But then also sometimes it pops up in places where you weren't expecting it, and you're like, 'Oh, this is actually a generalisation that actually helps with this particular bit of analysis. Ah! Maybe we still want to have sonority after all.' [Music]"

51,5,Lauren,"Hey, Gretchen, how's your book going?"
51,6,Gretchen,"Oh, well, you know, it's been out for a bit over a year now. It came out in paperback earlier this year. The media I've been doing for it has been dying down, which is nice to take a bit of a break, but people are still tagging me about them reading it on social media, and that's really nice. What I've actually been working on this year has been this series of intro linguistics videos with this big educational YouTube channel, Crash Course -- as you know, Lauren, because you've been working on it with me."
51,7,Lauren,I see that it's a very well-practised answer to that question.
51,8,Gretchen,"I mean, it's a question that people have been asking me for five years now. The answer does keep changing, but I have had a lot of practice."
51,9,Lauren,I imagine it's definitely in high rotation for people making small talk with you.
51,10,Gretchen,It's a good way of getting into this idea of small talk questions -- asking about people's lives -- and how we think about what types of things we can use to get into a conversation about how someone's been doing or what someone's been doing lately.
51,11,Lauren,"This kind of small talk is something that is really important for building or maintaining social relationships, whether that is with the waiter at the café you're at, or with your friends or family members. The name 'small' in 'small talk' is a little bit misleading because it diminishes what is actually the really important social function of this kind of language where it helps us ease into relationships whether that be with the waiter at our local café or our closest family members and friends."
51,12,Gretchen,"I think that there's the sense that small talk is either really easy or really difficult or what's going on there and can we analyse those types of conversational turns in a linguistically interesting manner. I definitely think we can. I wanna pause and distinguish small talk, which are these questions, 'How are things going,' 'How's the book,' 'How's the job,' 'How's the baby,' 'How's living in the place you're living still,' 'How about that local sports team,' 'Nice weather we've been having lately.' Those are small talk conversations, and they're not quite as rote as another topic we've talked about before, which is phatic expressions. That's things like, 'Hey,' 'No problem,' 'Bye,' 'Thanks,' which are really very rote and very ritualised. When you say, 'How's it going? Good. How are you,' that's phatic. But when you say, 'How are things these days,' and you're like, 'Oh, well, you know, not too much. I've been doing this,' that's when we get into small talk when it's a little bit more original -- but often not that original because you do end up with that certain level of rehearsal."
51,13,Lauren,"Definitely trodding well-worn ground sometimes in small talk. Sometimes, it can take you in surprising directions. I always find it interesting which topics of conversation are appropriate small talk and how that can vary across different groups of people or entire cultures. It's part of the whole collection of things that you have to learn about learning a language beyond just learning specific words and sentences. Have you found yourself in the middle of small talk different set of expectations before?"
51,14,Gretchen,"Yeah, I mean, I always have this experience whenever I manage to successfully make small talk about sports that I feel like I've really gotten away with something. Sometimes, I'll be talking with one person about -- in Canada, it's hockey. Montreal Canadiens have this big hockey game, blah blah blah, this thing happened, or like, Canada versus the US -- the Olympics -- that hockey game generally makes Canadian news. I'll learn like, 'Oh, it went to overtime and there was this big save at the last minute,' or something like that, and then I'll get to mine it for small talk for like a week. I always feel like I've gotten away with something."
51,15,Lauren,Good making use of your limited engagement with sport.
51,16,Gretchen,"I mean, I don't engage with sport zero amount of the time, but I definitely don't have as much deep engagement with sport as a lot of people do. So, I feel like I've entered a different world when I manage to have small talk about sport."
51,17,Lauren,"I always find it interesting how small groups of people have their own expectations about what topics of small talk are appropriate. It's always really a bit of a relief when you find a social group where they do the same kind of set of hobby references or things like favourite films and TV shows as the basis of small talk. It's just like, 'Ah, okay, this is a conversation that I can easily navigate.' It's always a delight if you share those media references with people."
51,18,Gretchen,"It's really interesting because you can be trapped in that conversation of like, 'Oh, here are two people who are just making references from The Office at each other, and I haven't seen The Office' or insert TV show that's popular that you haven't seen. In some cases, you can pick up references. Like, I know all the references from Mean Girls because enough people have seen it. I know all the references from Oregon Trail, that very early video game that people played, even though I never played it because -- you know, 'You have died of dysentery,' or 'So-and-So has died of dysentery,' is just a phrase that gets repeated. So, even though I haven't played that game, I can make these references to a certain level of depth."
51,19,Lauren,"Yeah. There're the small talk topics of conversation and then there's the media references that you use to build out rapport with people as well, which is another extra level of solidarity building and group building in the small talk process. Sylvia Sierra is a linguist who's done some really nice work on The Oregon Trail, which is, I assume, why you brought that example up."
51,20,Gretchen,"Yes, Sylvia Sierra has this great paper that's about video game references as resources in friend interaction and how people quote video games. Especially, I think it's like Gen X and Millennials quote video games as part of conversation to shift things into a more playful aspect for a serious topic or ways of maintaining group identity."
51,21,Lauren,"Listening to how Gen Xers do that and why people do these media references has made me feel a lot less threatened by people who weave poetry or Shakespeare references in. Especially people from a century ago who just add a bit of a Shakespearean subtext to their conversation, it's like, 'Ah, they're just doing what we do now with The Office.'"
51,22,Gretchen,"It's the same thing. It's funny. Speaking of Shakespeare, one play that was really popular during Shakespeare's era was Troilus and Cressida where you have these two young lovers-ish, and they have this slightly creepy uncle who's named Pandarus who tries to put them together and get them together. This is where our verb 'to pander' comes from."
51,23,Lauren,Ah!
51,24,Gretchen,"It's actually a very old, embedded media reference that people have forgotten about. I recently read Troilus and Cressida for...reasons, and I was like, 'Wait. This is the origin of this.' And you start spotting it in other Shakespeare plays where he has this Troilus and Cressida reference, which is kind of like having a modern play or show or something that's like, 'Oh, my book has a Hamilton reference,' and it's kind of the equivalent of here's this popular media property that you do your riff on and that you made clear references for."
51,25,Lauren,I feel a lot less cultural insecurity around supposedly high brow stuff like Shakespeare when you start realising the parallels between with how we do quoting of media references these days.
51,26,Gretchen,"Also, this is something that I bring up a lot when I do media interviews with people who are in a generation or two older from me, they're like, 'Oh, yeah, my kids, they just talk in memes now. My teenager, their friends just talk in memes to each other,' and it's like, 'Yeah, they're just doing media references. When you were their age, you used popular movies or popular songs, and you quoted lines from those. Maybe you quoted lines from Beatles songs or something.' This is the same thing they're doing except the stuff they're quoting is memes or popular videos on TikTok or something -- or popular gifs -- rather than quoting from movies or mass-produced cultural artefacts."
51,27,Lauren,Definitely a good way to really make sure your group of people you're talking to are in on the same page of knowledge.
51,28,Gretchen,"I think people find it reassuring because it's like, 'Oh, well, quoting movies didn't destroy society and quoting memes is not gonna do that either.'"
51,29,Lauren,"The flip side of having a small group of people with whom you've built small talk on recurring references is when you find yourself in a situation where you and the person you're talking to just have completely different cultural expectations of how small talk should function. We've had an earlier episode about how conversation can vary between people. There's a much more highly involved style of conversation and there's much less highly involved style of conversation, but in terms of small talk, we also have different genre expectations about what fits into small talk."
51,30,Gretchen,"There's that often-quoted thing about, 'You don't talk about politics or religion at the dinner table,' which is not true for everybody, but it's quoted as a beginner level version of that."
51,31,Lauren,"We do have an awareness about what we think of as appropriate topics for conversation. I had to really relearn how to do small talk in Nepal because there is a cultural expectation. Some people have talked about it as a genre of your small talk that you do with strangers and people you don't know very well is a suffering story genre where, to show people how resilient you are, you talk about all the bad things that have happened in your life, whereas my cultural script on this is that you don't tell strangers all the bad things you don't want to. There's a feeling that that is an imposition on someone you don't know very well to lay out all of your problems in life."
51,32,Gretchen,You don't wanna be seen as a complainer or something.
51,33,Lauren,Yeah. I think that's a feature of small talk that wouldn't be very controversial to say about Western cultures in general. It really took me a lot of time to get around the fact that people would tell me all these really exhausting terrible events in their lives and not because they wanted anything of me or they wanted me to fix it or feel sorry for them but just that this is the way that you show someone how authentic a person you are.
51,34,Gretchen,"I think I've been in a version of that conversation in Western English-speaking contexts when people start talking about travel problems that they've had. Like, 'And then MY flight was delayed for three weeks,' you know?"
51,35,Lauren,"I think once that genre does open up for Westerners, there's a bit of --"
51,36,Gretchen,One-up-manship?
51,37,Lauren,"-- trying to outdo each other -- yeah. The problem when you say these things as big cultural generalisations is like, of course individual conversations don't bear out like this. But it was really relieving when I started reading some anthropological literature on small talk in Western countries and small talk and genre appropriateness in Nepal and just like, 'Ah, this has a name. It's a known thing that other people have observed this cultural difference as well.'"
51,38,Gretchen,There's another genre of small talk which I think of as the 'Who's your father' genre.
51,39,Lauren,"Um, okay, I have several potential understandings of how that could go. What is this genre?"
51,40,Gretchen,"This is a genre that I grew up with in Nova Scotia which is, when you meet someone, you need to figure out how you may or may not be related to them. Even if you aren't necessarily related to them by blood, you need to figure out if you are or are not acquainted with some member of their family."
51,41,Lauren,"Right, yeah."
51,42,Gretchen,"I knew growing up in this that in certain contexts I needed to cite my mom's side of the family or my mom's mom's side of the family or my mom's dad's side of the family because who do I need to cite so that the person who I'm talking to can place me in this lineage sense. Even now, if I'm talking to relatives, sometimes somebody will come up, and it'll be like, 'Oh, So-and-So -- you know them because their kid was your age who you would've known blah blah blah.'"
51,43,Lauren,That is definitely not a small talk genre that I encountered growing up nearly as much as that.
51,44,Gretchen,"Well, I don't do it as much now in my daily life living in a city, but there is an academic version of that as well where you meet somebody at an academic conference, and they say, 'Oh, I'm a grad student at this university,' and you say, 'Oh, who's your advisor? Do you know So-and-So who I know who works at this university?'"
51,45,Lauren,"Oh my gosh, it's so funny because when you were talking about small town Nova Scotia, I was like, 'That's a weird genre of conversation,' and then I was like, 'Oh my gosh, I absolutely do that at conferences.' You're right."
51,46,Gretchen,"You've done the academic version of that. It can be easy to exoticise this like, 'Oh, this is a small town,' but you can also do this in the professional sense of like, 'Oh, you worked at this place,' or like, 'You studied at this place. Do you know this person who also works on this topic,' or 'Do you know this person who' -- and they'll be like, 'Oh, yeah, they're my advisor' or whatever."
51,47,Lauren,"Yep. I have had that small talk at conferences many, many times."
51,48,Gretchen,"It's like, 'Name a university and I'll tell you if I know someone in their linguistics department.'"
51,49,Lauren,"I wanna return to this idea of questions and the kind of -- because that is absolutely a go-to set of questions that I ask at conferences, and I feel like part of learning to navigate social interaction and learning to navigate this kind of small talk is having a little mental booklet of appropriate questions to ask in appropriate settings. That is totally a set of conference questions that I have."
51,50,Gretchen,"In the academic context, asking somebody where they're from -- this tripped me up at my first few conferences -- it's not asking them where they grew up or even necessarily where they live, but it's like, 'What university are you at?' When I go to academic conferences now, people will say, 'Where are you from,' and I know they're trying to ask --"
51,51,Lauren,"Yeah, how do you deal with that now?"
51,52,Gretchen,"I know they're trying to ask what university I'm at. So, I'll say, 'I'm actually not at a university.' I'm answering the assumption in that question even though it's not overtly in the question. 'But I live in Montreal, and I did my master's at McGill' or something, so they can place me in their academic genealogy. It's helpful to answer the hidden assumption in that question."
51,53,Lauren,"I always find it incredibly awkward when you enter a small talk situation where someone's set of go-to questions don't quite match up with what you feel comfortable talking about. Sometimes, it's because you might in an incredibly professional work setting and someone's asking you questions about your family. It's like, 'Well, uh, how many kids I have is not really relevant to talking about linguistics, which is what we're here for.' But sometimes it is a larger cultural thing around what is or isn't appropriate to pull from your set of small talk questions."
51,54,Gretchen,"There's an often-cited distinction -- and I expect this one may start breaking down when you start looking at smaller subcultures, like many things -- but there's an often-cited distinction between American versus French small talk conversations where Americans find it appropriate to say, 'What do you do for work,' ask people about their jobs, even maybe ask people how much money they make, or what they're paying for rent, or what they paid for a mortgage or a house --"
51,55,Lauren,"It's funny. The first half of those I'm like, 'Yeah, I would absolutely ask someone what they do for a job,' and then I would never feel comfortable asking someone how much money they earn."
51,56,Gretchen,"I wouldn't ask somebody how much they earn, but I remember being in my first few conversations, especially as a young adult starting out on my own, where people were swapping stories of how much they paid in rent for various places, and I found that so helpful, like how much you're paying in rent there so you can kind of get an idea of what the rest of the market looked like in different places. That bit I've seen people keep doing."
51,57,Lauren,"It's funny how maybe if we were all more overt about how much we were paid, we could unionise through small talk."
51,58,Gretchen,"Maybe we could! The comparison is that this is reputedly not socially acceptable in France where they tend to ask things like, 'Where did you go on your last vacation,' or 'What did you do on your last vacation,' which is not necessarily a small talk topic that I would bring up with somebody because maybe it's presumptuous to assume they went or did something interesting for vacation."
51,59,Lauren,Interesting. That is definitely not in my set of go-to questions. How do you feel about the genre of 'Do you have kids' or 'Do you have pets'?
51,60,Gretchen,"I mean, the thing is, I'm sure they're very interesting for people who do have kids or pets, but because I don't, it's just a conversational dead end for me. I have to be like, 'Do you wanna hear about my tomato plants? Because I know you're trying to have small talk here, but like, no kids, no pets.' Or I have to adopt somebody else's kids or pets and be like, 'Oh, no, I don't have kids, but my friend who has a kid who I was visiting just last week' -- it doesn't lead anywhere for me."
51,61,Lauren,"I sometimes feel a bit the opposite where I know it's a small talk question, and I should have a really pat answer, but I'm also living with a toddler hurricane, and I'm afraid that I will have too much information to share at someone. I think it's this thing where, because this is ritualised small talk and we're just doing it to build solidarity or pass time or establish some kind of common ground, for one person in the conversation, it's not really an important question, they just pulled it out of their mental list of questions, and for the other person, it is an all-consuming part of their life. Like, there're definitely points where I would not have asked you how the book is going."
51,62,Gretchen,"I mean, I did get asked how the book was going pretty much constantly for five years while I was writing it, and when it was coming out, and so on. Some people were very apologetic about asking and be like, 'Oh, I'm so sorry for asking, but the only small talk conversation I can think of to ask you is, 'Dare I ask how the book is going,'' which was this interesting relationship. Especially academics would often act like that because in academia there's this constant tension around 'How's the thesis going' or 'How's the dissertation?'"
51,63,Lauren,"I definitely -- because it's such a big project to write a PhD thesis, and people are often acutely stressed at various or many points throughout that process. Obviously, when I ask my own PhD students, it's a very different question because they have to tell me what they're up to. Basically, for anyone else, I don't ask them until they bring it up, which is a meta information tracking happening in the list of small talk questions. It's like, 'Oh, well, now you've mentioned your dissertation, that means you must feel okay to' -- or I'll do a lot of that hedging like, 'Uh, don't tell me if it's too stressful, but how's the dissertation?' That's very different to someone who just vaguely knows you're writing a book or doing a thesis or something."
51,64,Gretchen,"For me, it was interesting because there were definitely points in writing the book where I was stressed, but I didn't find the questions stressful because if I was feeling stressed at the time, it wasn't like I was thinking about anything else, so I might as well just tell you that I'm stressed. Or I might as well just tell you the like, 'Oh, I've submitted this one draft, and I'm working on another draft now,' or something like that. I would generally have some sort of answer to that question because it was just so ubiquitous in terms of how it was taking over my life. I also thought, 'Well, I want people to buy this book when it comes out, so if they're gonna keep asking about it, that's probably a good sign because that means they know I'm writing one.' So, I wasn't as annoyed about it as maybe someone with a dissertation where they're not trying to market it at the same time. I was like, 'Well, if they're asking about my book, maybe they'll wanna read it -- maybe they'll wanna buy it.'"
51,65,Lauren,"I like your understanding of what's happening in the small talk dynamic there. I mean, I think part of what happens when you think you're just asking a like, 'How's the book' or 'How's the kid,' and then you get this response where someone's like, 'We were up all night. They didn't sleep. They're teething. Ahh,' and you're like, 'Oh, o-okay. I don't know what to do here,' I think part of the tension here is going back to the idea of phatics that we talked about in that earlier episode where phatics are very much not about information. They're just a little dance that you do with each other to be polite. I think the problem is when you sometimes ask a question, and you're asking it in a much more phatic kind of like, 'How's the weather,' 'How's your kids,' just like, 'All good.'"
51,66,Gretchen,"Yeah. And there's a sense of 'How's your X,' where 'X' is something they mentioned last time or something you know about them -- you know, 'How's the job going?' You don't really necessarily expect to hear, 'Oh, everything is terrible, and I'm planning on quitting.' You know you might hear it, but you kind of want to hear, 'Oh, I'm working on this now,' or something like that. It's a way of trying to ask for a little bit more information. Yet, on the receiving end, that question still feels very personal."
51,67,Lauren,"Yeah, so one person's treating it far more like a phatic interaction, and the other one's treating it as a much less phatic conversation topic."
51,68,Gretchen,"It's interesting because I feel like this is one of the areas of language that you learn how to do comparatively late in your development as a child and adolescent and so on. I remember when I was a later teenager at holidays, summer breaks, family reunions, seeing family that you maybe see a couple times a year, and it was really helpful for me that my mom would coach me into saying, you know, 'You're gonna be seeing a bunch of relatives over the next week. They're gonna ask you how school's going. It would be good if you think of a two to three sentence answer that you can give them that tells them something you're okay with them knowing and lets you have a satisfying interaction there.' So, you can be like, 'Oh, I'm in Grade 11 now, and we're working on this thing, and it's interesting for me.' She would coach me to think about that in advance and be like, 'You can give the same answer to all of the relatives.'"
51,69,Lauren,"Oh my gosh, your mom should've been a discourse analyst."
51,70,Gretchen,"I really think she had a missed calling here. That was really helpful for me because I feel like this is my first media training because every single interview I did about the book someone always says, 'Why did you write this book?' and you have to have an answer to that, and you have to not be annoyed that you're giving the same answer to that. The same thing is like every single time you see a relative that you haven't seen for a year or two, they're gonna say, 'How's the whatever going,' whether that's, 'How's school,' or 'How's your job,' or 'How's the city you're living in.' They're trying to remember a noun that vaguely applies to you."
51,71,Lauren,"I love the experience with relatives in particular that you see once every year or so, or old family friends, because they'll be like, 'How's the basketball going?' and you're like, 'I have not played basketball for five years, and I was very bad at it at the time.' I think it's so much easier to come from a place of 'They're just trying to have this social engagement with me' rather than a point of irritation."
51,72,Gretchen,"It's so easy to get irritated. And yet, what the person's trying to do is express interest in your life, and if they say, 'How's basketball going?' -- or for me it was like, 'How's debate going?' which was a really good question for a while, and then I stopped doing it and can say, 'Oh, actually I'm doing that much anymore. What I am doing is this.' Because they don't know that they should be asking you about your new hobby, but you can just segue into the new hobby."
51,73,Lauren,It's not that they want a factual report based on their question. It's not a legal interrogation.
51,74,Gretchen,"Right. And thinking about the meta-question behind the question was also what let me figure out how to finally give a satisfying answer to the ubiquitous question, 'So, you're a linguist. How many languages do you know?'"
51,75,Lauren,"This is definitely one of those things where if you aren't a linguist, it seems like a perfectly reasonable question to ask. If you are -- it's that asymmetry in how frequently you have to have this conversation, right, where you might not talk to many linguists, and so you want to ask them questions like this. As the person on the receiving end of it, you are constantly asked, 'How's your thesis,' 'How many languages do you speak,' and it can be very -- for a long time my immediate reaction to that question was frustration, but as you say, understanding the real question there is just 'What do you do?'"
51,76,Gretchen,"So, if you happen to mention your cat, a natural thing for someone to do in conversation is be like, 'Oh, how many cats do you have?' The person on the other end doesn't care how many cats you actually have. They don't care if you have one cat, or two cats, or three cats. The next thing they're gonna ask is like, 'How old are they? What are their names?' They're gonna lead into the like, 'Oh, let's get the person to talk about their cats.' Or same thing with kids, the person doesn't care how many kids you have. They're just trying to make conversation. The thing that they think about when they hear 'linguist' is language, so they're like, 'I dunno, let's just put a question in front of 'language.'' The thing that I did for a while is I would go into, in great detail, all of the languages that I had vaguely learned a little bit of because I was excited about this. I would have all these caveats around, 'Well, I don't really' -- you know, you don't really speak Latin, but it's interesting because you learn how to translate it and to read it. And 'Do we even know what it means to know a language? To what extent do I blah blah blah?' Nobody was satisfied with this interaction. I knew it wasn't working for me because it was this very and long and detailed answer and didn't give the other person space to keep asking me questions or to answer some of their own questions. The answer was too long. If it felt complete to me, it also felt intimidating. People would be like, 'Wow! That's a ton of languages.' And I'd be like, 'Yes, but I don't actually speak any of them very well.' What I learned to do instead was just pick one language that I feel like talking about right now and that this person would probably be somewhat interested in it and just answer with that one language and with a bit of a story to it. So, if somebody says, 'How many languages do you know,' and I say, 'It's really interesting living in Montreal because there's so much French, and I speak French,' and that gives them the space to ask questions about Montreal or to say, 'Oh, I visited Montreal once. It was very nice.' Then we're having a conversation where there's a bit more back and forth, there's a bit of questions and answer, the person can say something, or 'Oh, I've always wanted to visit Montreal' or whatever, or they can talk about their speaking or non-speaking of French, and it doesn't lead me into this exhaustive laundry list that nobody's really happy about. It leaves open in later conversation if they mention Spanish or something, you can be like, 'Oh, I speak a bit of Spanish, too.' You're not lying, but you're seeing the question for the purpose behind it and answering that purpose rather than getting hung up on the specific details of the wording of that question because the 'How many' isn't actually the part they're interested in, it's the, 'You're a linguist; you must like languages. Tell me something about language.'"
51,77,Lauren,What I really appreciate is that you have used your linguist powers to do some analysis of what's happening in the conversations that you're having to more effectively do small talk. I think that's a really great example of applying linguistics that we don't often give people credit for.
51,78,Gretchen,"I mean, this is one of the holy grails of linguistics in my mind is to understand that meta-question or understand what's going on. I think of it in terms of Gricean Maxims in terms of pragmatics, which is another thing we've also done an episode about -- this is the call back episode -- which is the idea that anything that you say in a conversation, the other person will interpret as relevant to the conversation, and they'll seek ways to construe it as relevant to what's being said. If they say, 'How many languages,' and you reply naming one thing about one language, that's enough for that to be relevant to the conversation for the conversation to keep going, even though you don't have to do exact literal responses to everything because sometimes what people are asking is actually a different thing at a meta-level."
51,79,Lauren,"I think about small talk a lot from the perspective of something I find really interesting which is tracking knowledge state, so what the other person knows and what they might want to know. It's basically coming to the same conclusion as you, just with my own particular interest in what language tries to achieve in conversations. Kind of going, 'Well, the only reason they're asking me about this thing that I am bored to death of talking about is because they haven't heard about it yet.' I'm finding that as a way to feel more at peace. Especially years and years of doing retail, I found just being very zen about like, 'This may be the umpteenth time I've done this this week, but this person doesn't know about this thing.'"
51,80,Gretchen,"'Where are the bathrooms?' 'Look, I can just tell you. I've said this so many times today, but it's fine.'"
51,81,Lauren,"Using linguistics to make small talk more pleasant for you and the people that you are talking to, which may be useful if you happen to be listening to this in an impending holiday season, or if you're starting a new job, or if you're at a conference. Having some ways to navigate small talk are useful in so many ways."
51,82,Gretchen,"I also think it's useful in contexts where even answering a question like, 'How are you,' feels awkward because you're going through a hard time, and you don't feel like it's honest to say, 'Oh, I'm good,' but you don't necessarily wanna share or acquaintances don't necessarily wanna hear the whole story about how terrible things have been. This post on Tumblr, which we'll link to, gives the advice to say any at least mildly interesting fact about something you experienced relatively recently in the last few days. Like, 'My cat got stuck in a cereal box today,' 'Here's something that's on my mind,' or like, 'I got a package in the mail,' or something like this. People will interpret it as a valid answer to 'How are you?' People will take that at face value, and they'll take that as the non-answer that it is where you don't necessarily wanna declare that the whole world is fine because sometimes it feels like the whole world is on fire, or your corner of the world is on fire, but you don't necessarily wanna have that fire conversation."
51,83,Lauren,Absolutely -- we say at the end of 2020.
51,84,Gretchen,[Laughs]
51,85,Lauren,"Use the power of conversational relevance to divert -- yeah, and I think knowing that it's okay to steer the small talk boat and that is still meeting the aim of the small talk is a good thing to know."
51,86,Gretchen,"To go back to talking about, 'Here are all the terrible things I've experienced in my life,' doing the like, 'Oh my god, the news is so terrible, and I can't believe how terrible it is,' sometimes you have that back and forth of like, 'Ugh, it's so terrible,' 'Yes, it's terrible.'"
51,87,Lauren,That's the Nepali-style solidarity building through suffering.
51,88,Gretchen,"It does build solidarity. I think that gets us into this question of, 'How can we use our knowledge of small talk and the agendas of small talk, the meta-questions or the knowledge states that people exist in, to make small talk feel good for what you're trying to feel at the moment, ' whether that's to build solidarity or whether that's to distract you from what's going on in the world. What can you do to shift the direction of a particular small talk thing?"
51,89,Lauren,"Alongside that, I think looking at your list of questions that you potentially have to also steer the conversation -- I have occasionally had those super awkward moments with a group of work colleagues where no one has had a question that's allowed people to open up in a way that feels appropriate for that space. And then someone has asked a question that's worked really well or said something that's like -- I file that away. I'm like, 'Ah, asking if anyone's tried any new recipes lately worked really well in this work context.' It might flunk in another work context, but that's now in my brain as an option to keep things going. I think open questions really help people to take it and run in a direction that they feel comfortable with. As someone who was asked for far too many years after they graduated if they were a PhD student in a work context, it's just safer to ask open questions or just inflate someone. It's like, 'Are you a lecturer?' But even then, that can backfire."
51,90,Gretchen,"Oh, yeah, everyone loves being asked if they're a prof."
51,91,Lauren,Yeah.
51,92,Gretchen,"One of the questions that I have that I use a lot in conference settings are, 'How's your conference going?' because this works for pretty much everybody. You can ask the same person this question multiple times on different days."
51,93,Lauren,It doesn't matter if they're a PhD student who's here to just be an audience member or if they're a prof giving a plenary.
51,94,Gretchen,"It works in non-academic contexts, which is a lot of my conferences now. Another one that I have which is kind of a holdover from my time in academic conferences is, 'What are you working on,' because this seems to be a common question in academia. But in non-academic settings, I like it too because it leaves open the question of, you know, this could be a side project, this could be a hobby, this could be a thing you're doing at your job. It leaves that a little bit more open than, 'What do you do for work?' Another conference that I was at recently, we were doing a virtual networking event and sitting around a virtual table, and somebody said, 'What's something you've worked on recently that you're proud of?' And I was like, 'Oh, this is a really neat way to get to know people at this table' because it gets everybody the opportunity to be like, 'Oh, I wrote this article for this place' or like, 'Oh, I did this thing,' and gets people the opportunity to share their work and share something about them. I like that one. I'm gonna use that again."
51,95,Lauren,"I'm gonna add that to my list, too."
51,96,Gretchen,"The other piece of hacking small talk tips that I learned when I was maybe about 13 -- I think I was a young teenager. I remember being in my childhood bedroom when I read this book, and it was one of those self-help books. I took one sentence out of it, but it's been a very useful one sentence, which is about all you can demand out of a self-help book."
51,97,Lauren,What's this sentence? I wanna know. I can't believe you left this until the end. This is one of those bad self-improvement life hacking podcasts all of a sudden.
51,98,Gretchen,"'Please listen to us for half an hour to get the one golden sentence.' Maybe this is more obvious to people who weren't 13 at the time and had been to more networking events, which I had not done very much when I was 13, admittedly. This was the notion of the occasion/location statement."
51,99,Lauren,Okay. Can you unpack that for me?
51,100,Gretchen,"Yes, exactly. I will write you a whole little self-help book. When you're in an environment with strangers or acquaintances -- people you're trying to strike up a conversation with -- one thing that you can do that is not weird is you can look around and make some sort of remark about either the occasion -- the event that you're at -- or the location -- something in the environment. One example of this would be you're at a party, you don't really know very many people, so you go hang out by the refreshment table, and you start striking up a conversation with somebody about the cheese like, 'Oh, this cheese looks really good,' and then you segue from that into, 'Yes, this party's been so much fun blah blah blah.' Or if you're at someone's birthday party, you can be like, 'So, how do you know the host,' or the cliché -- I've never done this -- but at a bar or something, you go up to someone, and you're like, 'So, do you come here often?' Or if you're trying to strike up a conversation with somebody at the post office, you can be like, 'Wow! This line's taking a long time' because we're both standing in it or something like that. It's this thing that you have in common in the environment either based on the time or the space. That was how I first started thinking about small talk. Although, these days, it also segues into doing events where you hang out in virtual space. I've been experimenting a lot with doing proximity-based chats where you have, here's this virtual platform which lets you have conversations with more fluid groups of people rather than just being on a massive video call where only one or two people can talk at once. The thing that's interesting about them is, on the one hand, there's this built-in conversational topic which is, here's this new platform we're trying out, but on the other hand, that's like being like, 'Oh, look at this cheese tray,' or 'Look at this chandelier.' Eventually, you wanna move on from that into another type of conversation that's something you can have with not just anybody. You know, encouraging people to do introductions or introduce themselves in the chat or introduce themselves with each other or designating certain conversational topics or certain zones. I've realised that one of the functions of a conference when it comes to making conversation with people is that it gives you a different set of built-in conversational small talk topics that are different from what you have in ordinary life. You can say, 'Oh, have you been to any talks that you really liked,' and then you can start talking about what happened in the talks. That gives you an entry into a different type of conversational topic than you might have with somebody that you run into in line at the post office even though, hypothetically, that person might be able to have that conversation, but you don't have the shared knowledge that you could enter into it together."
51,101,Lauren,"A small talk experience can just be that moment of small talk, and you have a nice chance to interact with each other. Or it can be that segue into a much deeper domain-specific or, you know, content-specific for linguistics, or feeling-specific if you're with your friends and/or family. But it's such an interesting genre to pull apart in and of itself."
51,102,Gretchen,"It's really interesting to think, okay, what do we have that's that bridge between your phatic expressions, which are really rote, and your, you know, 'Oh, we're having this conversation that neither of us has ever had before, and we're arriving at all these interesting insights.' You just don't always end up there, and that's okay. It can be much lower effort to do a conversation where one or both of you has had this conversation before, and you're just having it with each other instead of with somebody else. It's a genre that's interesting to analyse and to figure out how to make satisfying for yourself as its own thing. [Music]"

52,12,Lauren,"Gretchen, do you remember learning how to read?"
52,13,Gretchen,"Not really. I mean, I remember encountering the alphabet chart in my first year of school, but I already sort of knew the alphabet at that point. I guess there was some point when I didn't know how to read, and there was some point when I did, but I don't really have concrete memories of that. Do you remember learning how to read?"
52,14,Lauren,"I feel like I have more memories of learning how to write, just because that's such a mechanical thing. I remember sitting there writing out a row of As. I definitely wrote the number 'five' backward for way longer than I probably should have, which is a really common thing that happens when kids are learning to write because it is a combination of brain skills and fine motor skills. But reading in English is something I feel like I've always just been able to do. I mean, I guess in comparison learning to read Nepali, which is written in a different script -- it's written in the Devanagari script -- I have more memories of that because I did that in my 20s. Even now, I still feel the real disconnect between being relatively able to chat and really struggling to read and write. I still have to put my finger under the words as I'm going through, whereas with English it just feels like the words are beaming straight into my brain because I learnt to read that language so early in my life."
52,15,Gretchen,"Yeah, I read at this automatic level. I can't see a sign that says, 'Stop,' on it and not read it in Latin script. But in undergrad I took both Ancient Greek and Arabic. In Greek, I got to the point -- because the script is sort of similar enough and I was familiar enough with the letters previously-ish -- that I got to the point where I could very slowly sound out words as I was reading them out loud because we had to do a lot of reading aloud in Greek class. But in Arabic, I was very much at that hooked on phonics level where you're like, /p/-/t/-/k/-/a/. There are a few words that I have as sight words in Arabic. One of them is the word for 'and,' which is 'waa', and one of the words for 'the,' which is 'al', and one of them is the word for 'book' because 'kitaab' just shows up all the time. But most of the words I had to painstakingly sound out each letter and then listen to myself as I was saying them. I'd be like, 'Oh, it's that word,' even if I knew it, which is this process that I must've gone through in English, but I don't remember doing it for the Latin script."
52,16,Lauren,"I think that is one of the things that makes it really hard for people who grow up in highly literate, highly educated societies to tease writing and reading apart from language. But actually, when you step back, you realise that writing is actually super weird."
52,17,Gretchen,"It's so weird! It's this interesting -- it really is a technology. It's a thing you do on top of language to do stuff with language, but it's not the language itself. There are thousands and possibly millions of languages that have never been written down in the history of humanity. We have no idea. We've never met a society of humans, or heard of a society of humans, without language. But those are spoken and signed languages, which are just kind of there. Writing, by contrast, was invented somewhere between 3 and 4 times in the history of humanity."
52,18,Lauren,That we know of.
52,19,Gretchen,That we know of.
52,20,Lauren,There might've been a society that did a very ephemeral form of snow writing that we have lost forever. But we have records of 3 or 4 times.
52,21,Gretchen,"It's been invented a handful of times. There are a few other cases where there are scripts that haven't been deciphered by modern humans. Maybe they're scripts, maybe they're not -- it's not quite clear. But it's definitely a handful of number of times. And then once other cultures come in contact with the technology of writing, they're like, 'Oh, this is cool. Let's adapt this to our linguistic situation,' and it gets borrowed a heck of a lot. But it only got cemented a few times."
52,22,Lauren,"It's worth saying that '3 to 4' is a bit squishy because it's not entirely clear if cuneiform, which is a very pointy form of writing from Babylonia, somehow inspired the Egyptian system that became what we know as the hieroglyphs or if they just happened around the same time by coincidence are something we may never really fully put together. That's a very contested situation. That's why we can't even pin down the number of times we think it was invented."
52,23,Gretchen,"Cuneiform is the one that's made with the sharpened reed that you push into your clay tablets or, if you're some people on the internet, into your gingerbread because there's some really excellent examples of cuneiform gingerbread tablets people have made, which I just wanna -- yeah, it's really great. The Egyptian hieroglyphs people have seen. But yeah, it's unclear whether they were in contact with each other and kind of heard of each other in a very loose sense and were inspired by each other because there was some amount of contact between those two areas, or if that was elsewhere. The other two -- one is in Mesoamerica, in modern-day Mexico and that area, where they had a writing system there that, again, developed into lots of different scripts as it got borrowed from different areas, of which the best deciphered is the Mayan script from the 3rd Century BCE. There's also the Olmec script, which is probably the oldest. The Zapotec script is also really old. There's a bunch of scripts in the modern-day Mexico area that also developed independently."
52,24,Lauren,"Then the final system arose in China around the Bronze Age a couple of thousand years BCE. Because this script was mostly found in its most earliest forms on oracle bones, it's known as the 'oracle bone' script."
52,25,Gretchen,What is an oracle bone?
52,26,Lauren,They are turtle bones that are used in divination.
52,27,Gretchen,Oh.
52,28,Lauren,Yeah.
52,29,Gretchen,"And, again, the Chinese script, once it developed further, it was also, yeah, influenced a bunch of the other writing systems in the area."
52,30,Lauren,"I find it super fascinating, with absolutely no historical knowledge or insight to bring to this, that in these three different places that were completely separate and going about their own cultural lives writing arose at a similar time around 3,000 to 4,000 years ago."
52,31,Gretchen,"Yeah! You wonder what was in the water or something. Well, and it's partially, I think, that there's a certain level of writing makes it easier to do things like administrative bureaucracy if you're trying to keep track of whether people paid their taxes or -- it's a very empire-y thing to have is to develop a writing system."
52,32,Lauren,"Oh yeah. And it's absolutely worth stating that it's not like three people in these three different locations all woke up on the same Tuesday 4,000 years ago and were like, 'I'm gonna write a long letter to someone.'"
52,33,Gretchen,"Did they have Tuesdays 4,000 years ago?"
52,34,Lauren,"What you see is this emergence of, 'I'm just gonna make a couple of notes so I know how much money you owe me.' Some of the earliest cuneiform tablets we have are just, like, beer supply stock takes."
52,35,Gretchen,"Like, 'Three oxes and this many baskets of grain' or whatever."
52,36,Lauren,"I feel like it's very human to be like, 'We love writing because it's poetry, and I can send letters to people I love,' and it's like, no, it's actually, 'I just wanted to know how much you owe me.'"
52,37,Gretchen,The king just wants to know if these people have paid their taxes.
52,38,Lauren,"So, what you get is -- although I'm like, 'Oh, it all happened within similar millennia,' it is actually centuries of development from just keeping tabs on a few items to a fully fleshed out written system."
52,39,Gretchen,"What types of things people thought were important to write down -- things like legal codes and stuff like that -- one of the interesting things that I came across when I was looking this up was that there's a person named Enheduanna, who is the earliest known poet whose name has been recorded. She was the high priestess of the goddess Inanna and the moon god Nanna in the Sumerian city-state of Ur. There we go. But authorship shows up much later than some anonymous civil servant keeping track of who's registered which grain or some anonymous priest or something keeping track of who's made various offerings. This idea of like, 'Oh, you're gonna write poetry,' is a step later."
52,40,Lauren,Filing your tax is what is actually one of the best links you have to those ancient civilisations.
52,41,Gretchen,"There's this Egyptian named Ptahhotep -- that's 'Pta,' P-T, even though I know I'm not pronouncing it that way -- he was a vizier in Egypt. He's also one of the first named writers, the first book in history -- or people call him the first book in history -- because he wrote these Maxims of Ptahhotep. There may have been people who were writing on more perishable materials that didn't get recorded and stuff like that. It's this whole process of, 'Okay, I'm going to draw these little diagrams of oxen or something or draw these little diagrams of this plant or this animal or whatever to record what types of things get recorded.' But then in order for it to actually become a writing system, there's also this step of abstraction that has to happen. This is when you start saying, 'Okay, well, the word for this very easily visualisable thing' -- so I'm thinking of oxen because the word for 'ox' in one of the Semitic languages, I think, was something like /alef/. And so, this 'ox's head' gets transformed into, 'Okay, what if this is the sound at the beginning of the word for 'ox's head,'' which is /alef/, and it gets transformed into our modern letter A, which is 'alpha.' 'Alpha' in Greek is just the name of the letter. It's not 'an ox's head' in Greek anymore because the Greeks borrowed it form the Phoenicians. This level of abstraction that has to go from, 'Okay, I'm gonna draw an ox's head' -- if you turn a capital A upside down, it kind of looks like an ox's head."
52,42,Lauren,"It's got its little horns, which are the feet of an A."
52,43,Gretchen,"Yeah, and there're all these related languages. You know, Arabic's got alif at the beginning, even though it doesn't look like an ox's head anymore. Hebrew's got an alef, and Greek's got an alpha, and all of these alphabets that begin with A. It's this level of abstraction where you can use this thing to stand for this thing that was associated with an ox."
52,44,Lauren,"There're a couple of main different ways that you can relate these abstract images that you're putting down in writing to the language that you are trying to capture. Of course, being a linguistics podcast, I was gonna bring this straight back to the structure of language."
52,45,Gretchen,"Well, I think it's interesting to look at the structure of languages in different areas of the world, and how people reflect those in the writing systems that are developed for those languages. When they borrow a writing system for a language with a very different structure, they end up doing certain adaptations to account for not just like, 'Okay, languages have different sounds,' but also those sounds are organised and structured in different ways with relationship to each other. The writing systems often reflect some of that history."
52,46,Lauren,"The Latin alphabet that both of us are most familiar with has a very approximate correspondence between each character of the writing system and a sound in the language. And I say 'approximate' because English spelling is a wonderful historical record of how some of those sound changes have changed over time. I'm just gonna keep this upbeat. You can fall down a giant well of English writing system problems, but to get to a point where the majority of letters have a pretty stable correspondence to sounds that we recognise as phones in the language, and that allows us to write out the words of English."
52,47,Gretchen,"One of the things that's true about a lot of the Indo-European languages is that they have a particular ratio between consonants and vowels in the words, where they have a fair bit of consonants in relationship to their vowels but not a ton. You can see this in the writing system because the writing system represents consonants and vowels separately. And yet, when the Greeks were borrowing the alphabet from the Phoenicians -- Phoenician is a Semitic language like modern-day Arabic and Hebrew -- that alphabet only had consonants in it -- letters for consonants -- because the vowels were not that important. This is still true of modern-day Semitic languages is they're often written in writing systems that don't represent the vowels or kind of optionally represent the short vowels, or sometimes they represent the long vowels, but they're often written in writing systems where the vowels can be omitted. That's not really a thing you can do very well in Indo-European languages and still have things understood because the vowels carry enough information that you need to represent them somehow."
52,48,Lauren,"Even when you have a phonemic script, it's not necessary to always represent all of the sounds to convey the language."
52,49,Gretchen,"Right. Then conversely, there are other languages where the vowels are even more important and, in fact, every consonant comes with a vowel or virtually every consonant comes with a vowel. In those, you often get what are called 'syllabaries,' where they represent one syllable at a time, because why bother with representing each of these things separately when in every context where you have a consonant there's gonna be a nearby vowel -- or in virtually every context there's gonna be a nearby vowel -- and so you can have a symbol that just represents the whole syllable there. That's also a structure that doesn't work very well for Indo-European languages because they don't have that many vowels. There's this spot of like they have important enough vowels that you need to represent the vowels somehow but not so important are vowels that you have to represent lots of vowels all the time, whereas languages like Japanese or Hindi -- well, Hindi's Indo-European, but it's got more vowels, I guess."
52,50,Lauren,"The Devanagari writing system is inherently focused on the syllable, which is a very different approach to reading. Each character of this writing system, if there's no vowel specified, it just comes with a bonus vowel. It's like, 'Buy this consonant, get this free letter A sound.'"
52,51,Gretchen,"Right. That's partly a feature of the writing system, but it can only be a feature of the writing system because it's already a feature of the language. A similar thing goes for a language like Chinese, where a lot of things are based around a syllable."
52,52,Lauren,"Then you can go a level of abstraction further where your character in the writing system represents a word-level thing and doesn't have a direct relationship to the sound correspondence, which is what happens with the Chinese script."
52,53,Gretchen,"I think it's important to recognise that there is a phonetic component to Chinese characters. They often make use of -- especially for words that are more abstract -- it's not just like, 'Oh, here's a bunch of little pictures that we've drawn,' because that's not capable of conveying abstract concepts like grammatical particles and words for things that don't come with easy pictures. And so, making use of, 'Okay, a lot of our words are one or two syllables long, so here's a word that's relatively easy to visualise that sounds very similar to a word that is not as easy to visualise.' We can just add a thing to be like, 'It sounds like this, but it's got a meaning more related to this,' and you can be like, 'Oh, it must be this more abstract word.' The classic example, which I'm definitely gonna do the tones wrong on, is that the word for 'horse' is /ma/, and the word for mother is also /ma/ with a different tone, and you can add the little horse semantic component with the woman semantic component and be like, 'Oh, it's the word that sounds like 'horse' but has to do with something with a woman,' and then you end up with 'mother.'"
52,54,Lauren,"This works for languages in China because they tend to be not as long as words in English. We like to add all these extra bits of morphology within our grammar, whereas, again, you get -- not a direct rule force -- but you get this general tendency where the writing system kind of fits with the vibe of the grammar of the language."
52,55,Gretchen,"One example of that is in Japanese where they were heavily influenced by the Chinese script, but Japanese actually does have suffixes and other little grammatical words and things you need to change about words. They made some of the Chinese characters that had formerly only had semantic things into just like, 'Oh, this makes this sound, and this makes this sound,' because they needed to be able to represent that morphological information that's not super important in Chinese but is very important in Japanese. You end up adapting a script into something else when it gets borrowed in a different context. Another interesting example here is Farsi or Persian which is an Indo-European language that's conventionally written with the same script as Arabic except it's also had a couple of additional letters added because Persian has a P and Arabic doesn't. They had to create a symbol for the sound P, which is why you get 'Farsi' instead of 'Parsi' because Arabic doesn't pronounce that P. So, it makes the P into an F. Sometimes you get people adding additional letters like adding a letter for P. Sometimes you get adapting whole sets of a script."
52,56,Lauren,"Sometimes you lose letters. English had distinct characters for /θ/ and /ð/ until it was technologically easier to just use the characters in the printing press that English had borrowed. It's makes me a little bit sad. But also, it makes international people -- maybe it's a little bit easier."
52,57,Gretchen,"We used to have a thorn for the /ð/ sound, but those early printing presses from continental Europe didn't have thorns on them. I mean, Icelandic still has thorns. One of the things that I think is more interesting in the closer to modern era -- not strictly modern era -- is cultures and peoples that are familiar with the idea of writing yet take the idea of writing and say, 'We're gonna make our own homegrown script that actually works really well for our particular language.' One of my favourites is the Cherokee syllabary, which was invented by Sequoyah, who was a Cherokee man who didn't know how to read in English, but he'd encountered the Latin-based writing system in English. He thought it was cool that the English speakers had this, and so he locked himself in shed for several years and came up with a syllabary for Cherokee. Some of the symbols on the Cherokee syllabary look something like Latin letters, but they stand for completely different things because he wasn't just learning to read from English. Some of them are completely different. This became hugely popular among the Cherokee in the area. There were newspapers in this in the 1800s. There was very high literacy in Cherokee country. It was really popular. It's even still found on modern-day computer keyboards and stuff like this. You can get Windows and stuff in Cherokee. It's this interesting example of that's one where we can say a particular person was inspired by writing systems but also created his own thing that became very popular."
52,58,Lauren,"The thing that makes Cherokee so compelling to me is not only did he come up with an incredibly elegant, well thought out, suits the language system, but that he actually got uptake as well -- that the community decided to use this as the writing system that they would learn to read and write in, and that it had uptake. It's very easy to come up with ways of improving the technology of writing but, as I think you're fond of saying, language is very much an open-source project. You can come up with really elegant solutions, but if no one else is gonna take them up, that's not gonna be very helpful. So, Sequoyah's work is doubly amazing for that reason."
52,59,Gretchen,"People actually made printing presses with the Cherokee symbols and were using those. Another interesting case of this disconnect between a person or people coming up with a system and actual uptake of it is Korean, which has what I think linguists generally agree is just the best writing system."
52,60,Lauren,"Yeah, we're like, 'Writing as a technology is amazing. All writing systems are equally valid. But Korean is particularly great.'"
52,61,Gretchen,"'But Korean's really cool.' The thing that's cool about it from a completely biased linguist perspective is that the writing system of Korean, Hangul, the script, is not just based on individual sounds or phonemes, it's actually at a more precise level based on the shape of the mouth and how you configure the mouth in order to make those particular sounds. There's a lot of, okay, here are these closely related sounds -- let's say you make them all with the lips -- and you just add an additional stroke to make it this other related sound that you make with the lips. Between P and B and M, which are all made with the lips, those symbols have a similar shape. It's not an accident. It's very systematic between that and the same thing with T and D and N. Those have a similar shape because they have this relationship. It's very technically beautiful from an analysis of language perspective."
52,62,Lauren,"I love this so much that when we were prototyping a potential script for the Aramteskan language for the Shadowscent books, when I was constructing that language, I also started constructing a script that we never used anywhere, but it was helpful to think about how the characters would write and what writing implements they would use. If you look at the script, you'll notice that the letter P and B are very similar, but B has an additional stroke. T and D are very similar, but D has an additional stroke. Very much feature driven. And then for the vowels -- it's roughly a quadrant in the writing space -- the /i/ vowel is in the top left of the quadrant, the /u/ vowel is in the top right of the quadrant, the /a/ vowel is in the bottom left of the quadrant."
52,63,Gretchen,So clever!
52,64,Lauren,"It was actually just for really selfish reasons that I decided to go with a feature-based system, and that is that it was easier for me to remember if I used the features of the language and made sure that the voiced sound was always identical to the voiceless one but just with an additional stroke. It meant that I only had to remember half the characters."
52,65,Gretchen,That's very elegant. The easy to remember bit is also true about the Hangul script because it's got so much regularity. The famous quote about Hangul is something like 'A wise man can learn it in an afternoon and a foolish man can learn it in a day.'
52,66,Lauren,So catchy!
52,67,Gretchen,There's probably a better version of that quote. What's interesting about it from an adoption perspective is that Hangul was invented by Sejong the Great.
52,68,Lauren,Appropriately named.
52,69,Gretchen,"Who has a national holiday now because of the script. But it was created in 1443. It's not quite clear whether it was him personally doing everything or whether he had an advisory committee of linguists, but it's really extremely well-adapted to the linguistic situation of Korean in particular. Even though it's just also really cool for how it represents the inside of the mouth, but it's really well adapted for Korean. It was invented in 1443, but it wasn't popularised in use until several centuries later because for a long time Korean was also using, like Japanese, this adapted version of the Chinese script or adapted version of the Japanese script because of the cultural influences. In the early 20th century, they were doing a much bigger literacy push in Korea to be like, 'What want everyone to learn how to read.' And they said, 'Okay, we're gonna have an orthographic reform, and we're gonna use this script which has this very nice historical pedigree but also is much easier to learn than this complicated thing that we had done that wasn't really designed for Korean.' It's got this historical antecedence but also it came back in the modern-day. Now, everything in Korean is written in it. It's because it's really easy to learn how to read and write in. The historical uptake wasn't immediate. It wasn't during King Sejong's lifetime where they were like, 'Oh, yeah, now we're all gonna use his script,' people were like, 'Okay, king, you've got this hobby,' but it wasn't popularised until later."
52,70,Lauren,"Even when there is really strong abstraction, humans have this unavoidable tendency to think about the relationship between sounds and other senses. In sound-based writing systems -- Suzy Styles, who has been on the podcast before and works on perception across the senses, did an experiment alongside Nora Turoman where they looked at whether people can guess, for writing systems they're not familiar with, which character was the /u/ sound and which character was the /i/ sound. They found that for a whole variety of scripts there is a much higher than chance -- because there's only two choices. If was completely arbitrary, it would be 50/50. But people do tend, across the evolution of sound-based writing systems, to have /u/ that has a more rounded, bigger sound has properties in the writing system that re-occur. People continue to unavoidably link the sounds of the language to the written properties of the script in a very low-level way. I'll link to that study. It's really great."
52,71,Gretchen,"That's interesting. It's not gonna be 100%, but there's this slightly better than chance relationship."
52,72,Lauren,Yeah.
52,73,Gretchen,Visual representation of physical information is also something that shows up in ways of writing signed languages.
52,74,Lauren,"Yeah. Everything we've talked about so far, I think, we've talked about for spoken languages, but it is possible to write signed languages as well."
52,75,Gretchen,"There are several different systems in place. Some of them are language-specific like, 'Oh, this is the system for writing ASL in particular,' and some of them are kind of like your linguist, International Phonetic Alphabet trying to provide a language-agnostic way of writing signed languages for research purposes but, in a way, that's sort of impractical, like the IPA for general use. There's an interesting set of systems. There isn't as much agreement among representers of signed languages in writing which amounts of information are crucial information that has to be written down and which are optional bits of information that the reader can fill in from their own knowledge of the language and the signer."
52,76,Lauren,"I think it's worth flagging that that's not just a discussion that arises for signed languages. It's just that those conversations got thrashed out for spoken languages four millennia ago, and we weren't around when people were arguing about whether intonation had any role in the -- or people probably were arguing because it was an emerging thing."
52,77,Gretchen,"Well, when people were arguing about like, 'Do we write vowels or not,' which was a big thing. Do we write vowels? Do we write intonation? And punctuation followed quite a bit after -- you know, punctuation wasn't as much of a thing for several of the early centuries and millennia of writing. They didn't do punctuation. There's some level of ongoingness that's still there. If you think about the internet efforts to try to write tone of voice very precisely and communicate sarcasm and irony and rhetorical questions very precisely, there's some level of ongoing debate that's still happening in the spoken language context but not nearly as much as is still happening in the signed language context."
52,78,Lauren,"Also, just because of the way that signed language communities tend to be embedded within larger spoken language communities, people who sign as a primary language tend to also be educated in the mainstream spoken language, and so literacy gets developed in, say, a language like English."
52,79,Gretchen,"I think that's the case for a lot of smaller spoken languages as well where sometimes there's this imperative of, 'Okay, we want to be able to write things to each other' or something, but if there hasn't been a history of a lot of published literature in that language that you're trying to read, then it becomes a question of, 'Should we teach this in school,' because there isn't literature there, even though there would be oral literature. It becomes a chicken and egg problem of which comes first, or which do you start teaching first, when you're constantly comparing stuff against a few very large spoken languages that have this very long writing tradition. It shows up in languages with a newer writing tradition."
52,80,Lauren,"Education systems have a massive influence there. My grandmother, actually her strongest written language is German. Even though she and her sister speak to each other in Polish, they would write to each other in German because that's the language they had been educated to write in. Even with people who don't speak minority languages, the influence of the education system there is so massive."
52,81,Gretchen,"Reading and writing, they're separate skills even though they're often taught together. Sometimes you can read a language that you can't write or something like that. But it's a big question. With signed languages, because video technology is now available, if we'd had good audio recording technology 4,000 years ago, the pressure to develop writing systems for spoken languages might not have been as strong -- probably wouldn't have been as strong -- even though there are other useful things that writing can do even in the audio-video era. It's easier to be like, 'Well, you can just make a video of the signer,' and then you'd know exactly what they were trying to say and exactly how they wanted to say it. You wouldn't have this level of abstraction of are you gonna try to write it down in a way that imperfectly represents what a person is gonna do when they're producing it. It is still interesting looking at some of the signed language writing systems. Some of them, like Stokoe notation and HamNoSys, which stands for 'Hamburg Notation System,' they try to very physically represent the characteristics of the signer -- where their hands are, where their face is, and things like that. There's another one that I can't find the name of that is based on the ASCII alphabet, so you can type it into search engine boxes, which has some advantages as well but represents things more abstractly. It's got this link with Korean, which was representing this very physical aspect of what the mouth is doing. Several of the signed language writing systems like Stokoe and HamNoSys also have this very physical representation what the body's doing when it's being produced. But I think they're more popular among researchers than they are among actual D/deaf users who tend to use video a lot."
52,82,Lauren,I encounter Stokoe and HamNoSys in the gesture and signed linguistics literature. I haven't really seen them too much outside of that.
52,83,Gretchen,"I think that it's easy to conflate a language with its writing system because we're so used to thinking of English as sort of inextricably linked to the Latin alphabet. But there isn't a reason, in theory, why you couldn't write English in the Greek alphabet or in the Arabic alphabet or in a very adapted version of Chinese characters where you'd have to do a lot of adaptation. The same thing is true when you write languages that don't originally use the Latin alphabet and you have romanisations of them. Writing systems are just as much political and contextual. Some of them have this very tight structural relationship to the properties of the languages they represent and some of them have looser relationships because they've been adapted to it later."
52,84,Lauren,"It's this slightly looser relationship to language as it's spoken or signed that means that linguists don't always include writing systems in, say, an Introduction to Linguistics course. We don't often talk about writing systems. But when we were putting together the Crash Course series, we ended up making writing the topic of our final episode for the series."
52,85,Gretchen,"I think partly because people are really interested in it, so why not do something about writing, and also because I think that you can use writing systems as a window into some of the interesting structural features of different languages and how the writing systems represent that. As somebody who's really interested in internet linguistics and the rise of informal writing and how we represent tone of voice and things like that in modern-day writing, and that's still a moving target evolutionarily speaking, I think it's interesting to give that linguistic lens on writing systems even though they are imperfect representations of the languages that they represent."
52,86,Lauren,"'Writing Systems' is Video 16 of Crash Course linguistics, which is wrapping up this month. If you've been holding out to watch all 16 of those episodes, you'll be able to do so very soon or perhaps even now thanks to the temporal vagueness of podcasts."
52,87,Gretchen,"Crash Course is the YouTube series that we've been working on basically all of 2020. It's especially popular with high school or undergraduate teaching. If you know people that age, or who teach people that age, that may be a useful thing to send to people. We hope that people find it useful as a resource for self-teaching or for instructing in various capacities. [Music]"

53,1,Lauren,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics! I'm Lauren Gawne."
53,2,Gretchen,"I'm Gretchen McCulloch. Today, we're getting enthusiastic about imperatives. But first, we're going to do a Lingthusiasm liveshow -- a virtual liveshow in late April brought to you on an internet near you for everybody who's a patron of Lingthusiasm, which there is still time to become. Keep an eye out in late April 2021. We'll be announcing the dates on social media and the website a little bit closer to the time."
53,3,Lauren,"This liveshow is our current Patreon goal. All tickets will be for patrons. That is available at lingthusiasm.com/patreon. If you're listening to this in the future from beyond April 2021, patrons will also be able to listen to the recording of that liveshow event as a bonus episode -- along with over 50 other bonus episodes."
53,4,Gretchen,"The Lingthusiasm liveshow is also part of LingFest, which is a bunch of other fun linguistics events that are happening in late April. Stay tuned to our website for more information about that. Also, in late April, we're doing a virtual conference for linguistics communicators called 'LingComm.' That's people who make linguistics communication materials online -- modelled after SciComm for science communicators. This is gonna be happening online. You can find more details about LingComm on the website lingcomm.org. That's 'comm' with two Ms."

53,6,Gretchen,Thanks for asking us such great questions on the Lingthusiasm patron Discord. Go hang out in the Discord if you haven't yet. It's fun! [Music]
53,7,Gretchen,Start the episode!
53,8,Lauren,Go on!
53,9,Gretchen,Be interesting!
53,10,Lauren,Do linguistics!
53,11,Gretchen,Stay lingthusiastic!
53,12,Lauren,All of these sentences are giving some kind of command.
53,13,Gretchen,"These are all what's known grammatically as 'imperatives.' They have the function of giving commands, but they also have the imperative, which is this particular grammatical thing where, in English, an imperative may begin with the bare form of the verb -- like 'start' and 'go' and 'be' and 'do' and 'stay.' That's a particular grammatical concept that we wanna talk about today."
53,14,Lauren,"The function of giving a command means that now, Gretchen, I expect you for the next half hour to be very interesting and very linguistic -- if you're going to obey the command that's been given."
53,15,Gretchen,"No, I was telling you to be interesting, Lauren."
53,16,Lauren,"Oh, okay. Well, now we're in trouble. It is possible to do things that have the function of giving some kind of command that's not an imperative -- that doesn't have the grammar of an imperative structure. So, 'I order you to be interesting,' is not actually an imperative."
53,17,Gretchen,"It is a command, but it is not an imperative. Sometimes, you have this -- I wanna say -- this very imperial Ancient Rome -- [imitates imposing voice] the Imperator or the Emperor is saying, 'Take this man away,' is sort of a command thing. But you can also use imperatives -- the form of the imperative -- to do things that are very polite. You can say something like, 'Come in,' 'Sit down,' 'Make yourself at home!' All of these are also imperatives, but they're polite imperatives."
53,18,Lauren,I hope that people don't think we're being imperious when we use the imperative to tell them to 'Stay lingthusiastic' at the end of an episode.
53,19,Gretchen,"Secretly, this episode, we've been building up to it since the very first one."
53,20,Lauren,"'Emperor' and 'imperative' are related etymologically, I assume."
53,21,Gretchen,"Yeah. The 'emperor' is somebody who has the authority to give commands, and it's definitely the core function of the imperative is that commanding function. But when I think of imperatives, I think about a young adult novel that came out in 1997 called, Ella Enchanted."
53,22,Lauren,"Did this also become, I remember, a movie?"
53,23,Gretchen,"No, don't talk to me about the movie. The movie is bad."
53,24,Lauren,"Okay. Well, I haven't seen the film, so that's fine. We can just talk about the book, which I also have not read. Enlighten us about Ella Enchanted."
53,25,Gretchen,"Ella Enchanted is one of those fairy tale retellings. In this particular context, the main character has a blessing/curse put on her by a fairy at her birth where she has to be obedient."
53,26,Lauren,Is this one of those blessings that inadvertently become a curse?
53,27,Gretchen,"Yeah. The fairy's like, 'I'm gonna give you this blessing. Ella will always be obedient. Now, stop crying, child!' And the baby has to stop crying because she's been given this command to stop crying."
53,28,Lauren,Very useful.
53,29,Gretchen,"I mean, like, who amongst us could not find this useful? Unfortunately, she grows up, and if people give her a command even inadvertently, she has to obey it. What's interesting from a grammatical perspective -- and I feel like why I always felt like I had a very solid grasp of what an imperative is -- is because she only has to obey things when they're imperative commands and not when they're more indirect commands. If somebody says, 'Stand up,' 'Sit down,' she has to do it. But if someone says, 'I wish you would stand up,' or 'Why don't you sit down,' she doesn't have to do it at that point."
53,30,Lauren,"Oh my gosh, she's a walking grammaticality test. She'll tell you if something's grammatically an imperative. This is fabulous."
53,31,Gretchen,Right?
53,32,Lauren,It would be amazing to have someone like this while you're trying to figure out the grammar of an imperative.
53,33,Gretchen,"Well, because then you could try it in different languages. Every time I see a stop sign, I'm like, 'Ella would just be stuck here. She'd just be stuck here until someone told her to go again.'"
53,34,Lauren,I assume it's a pre-technology world because --
53,35,Gretchen,It's like a fairy tale world with horses and stuff. She didn't have any stop signs.
53,36,Lauren,"Thank goodness she doesn't live on the internet because the amount of, like, 'Subscribe,' 'Click here' -- you would be ruined."
53,37,Gretchen,"Right? Every time she got told to 'Like and subscribe,' she'd have to do it. It's a fairy tale world, so she only has the usual problems with imperatives. But it really -- if you ever want a book to just tell you which things are imperatives for 286 pages of a charming young adult fantasy novel, I would recommend it."
53,38,Lauren,"I feel like if you have very small children in your life, you're also quite sensitive to imperatives and using them. There's a lot of having to be very direct at children. Even if you have a habit of maybe doing things more politely and indirectly while talking to adults, you just have to tell children to do and to not do things quite a lot. If you have small children or maybe cheeky pets in your life --"
53,39,Gretchen,"[Laughs] Pets. 'No, get off that! Don't run into traffic!'"
53,40,Lauren,'Sit.' Perfectly efficient.
53,41,Gretchen,'Sit!' 'Stay!' 'Eat your breakfast!'
53,42,Lauren,"Yeah, I was gonna say I can't tell if you're giving that example to a child or to a pet but, honestly, pretty much the same."
53,43,Gretchen,Does it matter?
53,44,Lauren,"If you have small people in your life, you're probably quite sensitive to imperatives."
53,45,Gretchen,"Meanwhile, I'm just sitting here with my tomato plants being like, 'Grow! Grow!' That's one of the things that's really interesting about a part in Ella Enchanted. At one point she gets a letter from her father, and then she's like, 'Wait, I gonna make this other person read it and summarize it to me' because if there are commands in it then she could summarize what they are in ways that aren't actually commands. In another context, she's interacting with a character who she doesn't really like but because that character is only saying, 'I wish you would do this,' or 'Why can't you stop doing that,' she doesn't actually have to obey that person because that character is still trying to be polite. Imperatives have this interesting interaction with politeness and with how we relate to each other as people -- who is it okay to give a direct imperative to, and what level of politeness does that have?"
53,46,Lauren,"It seems like giving direct imperatives to kids is something that occurs across a lot of different cultures. We don't have the data to say with confidence that it happens across all languages. In some languages, it's weirder to give direct imperatives to people who you're not familiar with. Maybe if you're more familiar with someone -- you might give more direct imperatives to someone you live with and spend a lot of time with. It really can vary across cultures and across individual contexts. One particular example I like is Sara Ciesielski's work on the acquisition of Sherpa by children. Sherpa is a Tibeto-Burman language. It's in the same family of languages I work with. In Sara's work -- there's a great three-minute thesis video summarizing it -- what she found was that parents give a particular type of direct imperative to small children. As the children grow older, they give those imperatives less. Children stop doing particularly foolhardy things, and they start to become more socialized into behaving in a socially appropriate way. In her data she found that, as those children got older, they were given fewer imperatives, but if they were talking to younger children, they would give them in the way that the adults do. You could see them getting socialized into this process of, 'If I'm talking to someone younger than me, and someone who's very young, I have to give them lots of direct imperative commands.'"
53,47,Gretchen,"I feel like I remember something about children learning a lot of imperatives very early in Mayan languages as well. I'm not sure. Now, I'm trying to find the paper. Of course, I can't find it again. But I remember reading a paper in grad school about Mayan children learning a lot of imperatives. I think it was Ki'che', maybe, or some combination of Ki'che', Yucatec, and possibly Mam. These are languages that do a fair number of things with the verbs, but the imperatives tend to be morphologically very short and very simple and not have a lot of prefixes and suffixes. They also make really good words for children to start learning more complicated verbal structures with."
53,48,Lauren,"Right. So, they learn these structures, but they also learn who it's socially appropriate to use them with. I mean, it's one of those things -- I have no real depth of knowledge about child language acquisition -- but I'm always amazed by like, children are given so many imperatives, but they still manage to use verbs and acquire verbs in all their other forms even though, for some cases -- and I know in Sara's work -- the number of verbs in the imperative form that children are exposed to is multiple times more than some other grammatical structures. But they manage to all grow up using more than just imperative forms of verbs."
53,49,Gretchen,"Well, and kids also overhear speech of adults between each other even if they're not addressed like that themselves."
53,50,Lauren,Absolutely.
53,51,Gretchen,"You have a variety of things that you're exposed to. But yeah, the imperative is this interesting -- it's like how linguists often observe that words that are for close family members have certain sounds that tend to be cross-linguistically easier. You know, 'Mama,' 'Baba,' 'Dada,' 'Nana,' 'Tata,' 'Papa.' There's a small set of syllables that are pretty easy for kids. Often, the names for close family members are from some subset of those syllables. They're not necessarily exactly the same from language to language, but they're a bit more similar than you'd expect coincidentally. I think that imperatives often being a little bit easier, a little bit shorter, having a little bit less-complex verbal morphology on them -- I don't know if someone has done that official typological study, but it seems like there's a general trend in that direction."
53,52,Lauren,"Which you'd need when someone is dangerously going in the wrong direction and you need to tell them to stop, or someone is just being a little bit too hectic and you need to tell them to sit."
53,53,Gretchen,"You can imagine early humans -- like a kid putting their hand into fire or something -- and you have to be like, 'No, stop!' Kids can try to do very dangerous things in lots of contexts. It's useful to have language that's accessible to tell them how to not do that."
53,54,Lauren,"Those short forms, we often talk about them as being bare because they don't have any extra morphemes that we stick on. Some languages do have a specific grammatical suffix that they'll stick on for an imperative. In Yolmo and other Tibetan languages, the politer form of the imperative has the suffix '-tong' or '-dong.' There are some that just are bare if you're being very direct at someone."
53,55,Gretchen,"English for the most part has a bare imperative as well. You have, 'Sit,' 'Stand,' and it's not like 'sitting,' or 'stance,' or 'walked,' which would be adding some sort of morpheme on there. I guess, in principle, you could add a prefix on there. I'm not aware of a language that does, but there probably is one somewhere."
53,56,Lauren,It's always dangerous to say languages don't do something because they'll be some awesome language somewhere that does the thing.
53,57,Gretchen,"There's probably some somewhere that do a prefix. I wouldn't put money on that not happening. Often imperatives are a bit on the short side, especially ones that are informal or singular -- like the kinds you would use with a child -- compared to polite imperatives. Oh, you could put lots of morphology on to be polite."
53,58,Lauren,"There's the suffix in Yolmo, and then there's a whole different form if you're being very polite in the honorific register. We've talked about honorifics in a bonus episode before, and I've talked about that vocabulary there. Again, that's that thing about giving a command is not necessarily impolite, you just have to use the correct honorific verb form to be polite when you're asking a visiting guru to come with you or to please sit down. There's a way to do that politely."
53,59,Gretchen,"I first, I think, encountered 'imperative,' at least as a term, when I was studying Latin. They have a singular and a plural imperative, so if you're giving a command to one person or if you've giving a command to multiple people, which many languages do something like this. The singular imperative is just the bare root of the verb with the theme vowel. You have something like, 'Veni,' which means, 'Come,' singular, and then 'Venite,' is 'Come,' plural, 'All of you come.'"
53,60,Lauren,Good for specific command giving.
53,61,Gretchen,"Yeah. There's this extra morpheme on the plural form, but the singular one, which is your 'Am I giving this command to a child,' is the very simple form."
53,62,Lauren,"I did say Yolmo had that suffix, but there are a couple of verbs where, instead of using a suffix for the regular, everyday imperative, there's just a completely different word. The most common one is -- Yolmo has the word, 'sa,' for 'eat.' If it was just a regular imperative based on the model of almost every other verb, it would be, 'Sadong.' But for this verb specifically, you have a completely different form of the word. You just say, 'So.'"
53,63,Gretchen,And there's no '-dong' at all?
53,64,Lauren,There's no '-dong' at all there. There's no suffix there. It's just a very short form. It's a word I heard a lot -- people asking me to eat as a guest. It's one I'm very familiar with.
53,65,Gretchen,"This actually happens in a variety of contexts where you'd expect one specific thing with the prefixes and suffixes, and then you get a different form of the root entirely. In French, for example, most of the imperatives do a very similar thing. You have, 'parler,' is 'to talk,' and 'parler' is also the imperative and the plural imperative. But then for a few words -- and one of them is 'be' -- you have 'je suis/tu es,' so 'you are' -- 'es.' But the imperative, like 'Be quiet,' which you would say to a child perhaps, is 'sois' -- 'Sois tranquille.' Literally, 'Be tranquil,' I guess, but it's used for 'Be quiet.' Or 'soyez' if it's plural. Like, 'Children, soyez tranquille,' like, 'All of you be quiet.' English actually also kind of does this."
53,66,Lauren,Right.
53,67,Gretchen,"This is the one maybe true imperative that you can test like, 'Is this verb being imperative right now?'"
53,68,Lauren,"You told me this the other day, and I was wracking my brain for ages trying to think about something where it changes completely in English."
53,69,Gretchen,Have you figured it out yet?
53,70,Lauren,"I've not figured it out, but now you've given me that example, I be it's something to do with the 'is/be' copula. That verb is a mess in English."
53,71,Gretchen,"Yeah, it is 'be.' 'Be' is just one of those really neat verbs because it's historically three different verbs all with their different forms glommed onto each other. Like, the 'is/are' one, and you have the 'wesan' with 'was' and 'were,' and then they also have 'be' and 'being' and 'been.' Those are all from three different roots that get glommed together to make one mega verb."
53,72,Lauren,"Yay, language!"
53,73,Gretchen,"Yay, language! This is a process that actually happens fairly often in languages just for a small handful of very, very common words. So, 'be,' or 'have,' or maybe something like 'eat' -- very, very common words. Sometimes they get really irregular or they get made out of combinations of several different verbs. Because they're so common, people can just remember this, whereas if it's really rare verb that maybe you don't encounter until you're a bit older or you don't encounter very often, it'd be hard to remember like, 'Oh, this verb has completely different letters in it.'"
53,74,Lauren,"It would be very weird for English to have a completely different form of the word 'to crochet' for an imperative because most people don't talk about crocheting a lot, and if you do, you rarely tell people that they have to as a command. When you have this pattern that fits for every verb except maybe one or two for the imperative or for other things as well. English is great with this kind of thing in tense when you have, 'I go/I went.' 'Went' is absolutely a completely different word to 'go,' but we use it in the past. This happens often enough in English that when we have these forms that don't fit the pattern, we call it a 'suppletive' form."
53,75,Gretchen,"Sometimes the imperative is where a suppletive shows up. Sometimes it's also a past or something else you could do with things. Sometimes you can have a suppletive imperative, which kind of defies the point about maybe them being easy for children to learn, but they are super common."
53,76,Lauren,You tend to hear suppletive forms with lots of frequency. That's how they manage to stick around.
53,77,Gretchen,Sometimes you also get a negative imperative.
53,78,Lauren,"Yes. As with the fact that some languages use particular morphemes and some languages don't use any morphemes, which is a nice throwback to our zero morphemes in the 'Nothing Means Something' episode, if you remember that sometimes the absence of something is still functional, there's a whole range of different ways that negating can interact with imperatives. But the thing that I find most charming about the relationship between negating and imperatives is that a negative imperative, as a category, can sometimes be called a 'prohibitive,' which is just one of those, 'I get that. That does exactly what that label says.'"
53,79,Gretchen,"Yes, the 'imperative' is you command someone to do something. The 'prohibitive' is you prohibit them from doing something, which makes sense. I have definitely just encountered the terminology 'negative imperative.' I hadn't encountered 'prohibitive.' I think maybe a little bit of the literature, or until you mentioned it, I was like, 'Oh, I guess you could call it that. I dunno if I would though.'"
53,80,Lauren,"I think it's the kind of thing where if your language does something interesting around negative imperatives, you're more likely to come up with the name 'prohibitive,' whereas, for example, in Yolmo, you don't use that imperative suffix with the negative. You just use the negative and the verb. Because it acts a bit differently to the imperative, I'm more likely to think of it as a prohibitive because it's a slightly different structure. I think this comes back to a larger conversation about whether you lump certain phenomena together because they're all similar enough in the languages that you encounter or if you split them up because they behave very differently."
53,81,Gretchen,"I think I'm maybe more of a lumper than a splitter, but it depends a lot on the context because what sort of thing you're exposed to can lead you more into lumper-ish or splitter-ish directions for particular things. Some languages just throw in a negator. Some languages, the negative bit for imperatives is a different negative morpheme than the negative morpheme in other contexts. Some languages you use a different form of the verb. When I was learning a lot of romance languages, the thing that always used to really just kind of grind my gears and show my lumper-ish tendencies was they'd be like, 'Okay, here are all the different ways of doing the imperative,' and there'd be two that would correspond to the Latin one of the singular and the plural one, and then there'd be the polite one, and there'd be the 'we' form for like, 'Let's this,' and there'd be the negative ones. Those would all be borrowed from the subjunctive."
53,82,Lauren,Which is an entirely different category with an entirely different set of functions but kind of borrowable.
53,83,Gretchen,"We're not gonna get into the subjunctive right now because the subjunctive is a whole other episode someday. But I'd be like, 'These forms are not some weird, surprising thing that you actually have to memorize 17 different things.' What it is is, 'Look over here in this table on Page 56 and just borrow the ones from the table on Page 56.' You only have to memorize one bit of information, which is the 'Go to Page 56 for this form.' You don't have to just suddenly memorize this whole other table as if it's some sort of surprising thing that's unconnected. It's really just borrowing from a different part of the paradigm."
53,84,Lauren,"Yeah, sometimes imperatives do share features or functions with other categories, which is a thing that crops up a lot in different categories of grammar. It's part of the fun of human languages and how they evolve in different directions and borrow things from themselves and copy across from different parts."
53,85,Gretchen,"It's interesting to think, 'Okay, what was the historical version of this?' What was the version of this language early on when they were like, 'Oh, we don't quite have an imperative for this particular context -- where else can we get something from the set of verbs that we do have or something from the set of things we're used to doing with verbs?'"
53,86,Lauren,Another thing that makes imperatives particularly interesting to try and elicit from someone if you're doing elicitation to figure out the grammar of a language as a linguist or if you just want to learn a language through politely interrogating native speakers is that it's actually really difficult to ask someone to tell you how -- that they should tell you to do something. It's a socially complicated little situation.
53,87,Gretchen,"Because if you say something like, 'Tell me that I should sit down,' they'd be like, 'Okay, you should sit down.' And you're like, 'No, wait! That's not imperative. That's a different statement.'"
53,88,Lauren,"Asking someone to tell you to do something directly, when they clearly don't actually want you to eat, so it feels weird and unnatural to be like, 'Eat!'"
53,89,Gretchen,"And some people find it more fun to join that play space about language like, 'Let's imagine that we have a dog, and we're trying to get the dog to eat' or 'Let's imagine we're trying to tell a child to eat,' or something like that. It's trying to figure out, okay, what is the exact context that can create the scenario which it would be said even though it's said a lot."
53,90,Lauren,That's not even taking into account that you might be working with someone in a culture where it is just so rude to give someone a direct command and that you need to observe them hanging out with a child or a pet or a person they're really close to to get actual uses of the imperative because you're some outsider to whom it would be incredibly rude to do that.
53,91,Gretchen,"Some places you can use imperatives politely as well. But there's often this additional social context. I think that there's also -- we were talking about earlier about like, well, you have this polite imperative or you have this plural imperative or this honorific imperative, and in a lot of the European languages that have these polite second-person pronouns, 'vous' or 'sei' or 'Usted' or something like that, they also figured out some sort of imperative there which is borrowed from some other bit of the verbal thing there because like, 'Oh, we need an imperative, but this was actually originally a third-person' or a plural or something, and you have to grab it from somewhere else. Imperatives start you in into, 'Okay, what do people do in this language and in this particular culture when they're addressing somebody? What are the ways you address somebody? What are the ways you don't address somebody? Which things are polite? Which things are impolite? What are all the things you can do?' There's this word in French that I don't actually know what it means so much as I know how it's used, which is just the word you add to something to make it a polite imperative."
53,92,Lauren,Excellent.
53,93,Gretchen,"It's 'veuillez.' It's got a lot of Ls in it. That's what French does. You'll see it on a lot of official signage. I don't know if I've ever heard someone say it out loud, but it's on so much signage. You'd have like, 'Veuillez sit down when the train is in motion,' or something like this."
53,94,Lauren,It's where you'd use 'please' in a polite English imperative.
53,95,Gretchen,"But it's not 'please' because you can put 's'il vous plait' in there as well, which is 'please.' It's just the polite verb that you use for the polite things. I'm sure it has a literal meaning, but that literal meaning is not as relevant as the fact that it's the polite verb you use for the polite things."
53,96,Lauren,"The social function of giving a command is also why imperatives are discussed as a thing where you direct it toward someone else who's also there -- a second person, 'You do this' -- because in order for a command to be effective, it has to be a person delivering it to another person."
53,97,Gretchen,"It sort of depends on how lumper and splitter-y you wanna get. If you wanna talk about first-person plural imperatives, if you wanna talk about something like, 'let's,' as an imperative or using other words like a hortative, it depends on what the grammar of a particular language is doing whether it makes sense to group it with the imperatives or not. Sometimes, like, 'Let's go,' or like, 'Let him go,' 'Let them eat cake' -- sometimes those are treated with the imperatives and sometimes they're not. But there's also a core set of imperatives of like, okay, well, what do you do if you're addressing one person, maybe a few people? And then there's all of the ancillary stuff around imperatives which is still just not that big of a space. I think it's one of those things where there's something about how humans organize their societies and their culture and their notions of self-hood and --"
53,98,Lauren,And how human brains are constructed.
53,99,Gretchen,"How human brains are constructed. It's kind of like how human societies have words for day and night cycles because we live on a planet that has a certain day and night cycle that's really salient to everybody who's here. That doesn't mean, in theory, you couldn't have humans who lived on a different planet that had drastically different day and night cycles that could have words for those sorts of things."
53,100,Lauren,"This is why I love speculative science fiction because you get to build worlds where if you had people who could melt their consciousnesses together, then the distinction between giving a command as an imperative to a second person becomes less meaningful if you're all the one consciousness."
53,101,Gretchen,"Yeah, if you had neuro links or a society with magic or something where certain imperatives come with the force of commands where they're magically enforced and certain ones are suggestions, maybe that ends up showing up in the grammar at some point. Or if you had, I don't know, swarm consciousnesses or something, or diffused consciousnesses, maybe the first and second persons would work really differently because your notion of consciousness would be different."
53,102,Lauren,"If you had multiple consciousnesses within one body, would you use a third-person imperative to talk to yourself?"
53,103,Gretchen,"I think there are people who have distributed consciousness or multiple consciousnesses, and they do various things -- sometimes a 'we,' sometimes, addressing other people."
53,104,Lauren,"There's so much scope for possibility, and humans occupy a tiny piece of that real estate, usually."
53,105,Gretchen,"In Embassytown by China Mieville, there's this thing where you have two brains that are occupying -- they have to say all of the words together at the same time."
53,106,Lauren,"Ah, yeah. It's been a long time since I've read that book, and it is so full of fantasticness that I can't even remember how those multiple-brain persons exist."
53,107,Gretchen,"It's been a long time since I read this book as well. I did not re-read it like Ella Enchanted, but I remember that in text, the words that they say simultaneously are written above and below a long line -- like an em dash or a long em dash -- and the words are written above and below. You have two mouths but one consciousness. It's a surface-level treatment there because it's not asking the question of, 'What would that mean for first persons and second persons and third persons?' It's just like, they say all of the words all at once even if it's just a noun."
53,108,Lauren,Gonna write a grant application to do fieldwork with fictional aliens in a sci-fi fictional world.
53,109,Gretchen,I just think the space is really underdeveloped and some people should be working on it.
53,110,Lauren,"There's so much possibility for what an imperative could do in other consciousnesses, but in the human languages that we know about and have been discussed, in general, it's doing something with the verb. That's where it tends to hang out. That's what we've been discussing so far. As always, I'm sure there are many caveats and complications, but it's doing something to the verb that's different from, say, something like tense, which is looking at time and where in time the verb is situated. It's turning something that's an action into a command."
53,111,Gretchen,"There's a distinction -- I think the easiest one to notice is the distinction between something like, 'I see,' 'I look,' 'I sit,' 'I go,' versus, 'See,' 'Look,' 'Sit,' 'Go,' where one of them is describing something that's going on, and the other one is giving a command which could have all the functions of polite command or impolite command in that range. It does change the vibe of the verb. The Romans, who did a lot of the descriptive grammatical tradition that we've inherited in the European language space, called this the 'mood' of the verb. I think we should maybe rename it the 'vibe' of the verb because it seems very intuitive to me. 'Mood' in this context is not like, 'Is the verb happy or sad,' it's just a vowel shift from 'mode.' Like, what 'mode' is this verb in? It's in the command mode. It's in the declarative mode, the describing things mode. It's kind of like, you know, set your gears to start or to reverse or to --"
53,112,Lauren,"And look, I'm not gonna lie. I think when these labels got added -- around 500 years ago they became really consistent with grammar teaching -- when they chose this word, I'm pretty sure they chose it for a really similar reason that you chose 'vibe.' 'Mode' is just this general word. It's still a pretty general word. We use it for fashion or, as you said, a mode of a machine."
53,113,Gretchen,You're mode of transportation.
53,114,Lauren,It's just one of these wonderfully convenient labels that you don't have to interrogate too deeply.
53,115,Gretchen,"'Mode' seems to imply that you can have a given verb, and it can sometimes be in this mode and sometimes be in that mode, whereas 'class' implies you have, you know, some verbs are in this class and some verbs are in that class, and they don't correspond. But they're all generic categorization words. They kind of just picked one. As far as I can tell, they just picked one and then that became the name for this distinction that they were trying to talk about of 'Is the verb like this or is the verb like that?' Well, that's it's 'mode.' Then we had an unfortunate vowel shift, and it seems like it corresponds to a mood like happy or sad. 'Mode' is sort of the more intuitive way of thinking about what the difference is between these categories."
53,116,Lauren,"People will sometimes use 'mood,' and they'll sometimes use 'mode' and talk about 'modality' If you see something that's talking about 'modality' in linguistics, it's generally talking about, well, is it just a declarative sentence explaining how the world works or is it in one of these other modes like the imperative. There are a whole bunch of others in this category."
53,117,Gretchen,"Well, and sometimes 'modality' is also used for modals, like 'can' and 'must' and 'should' and stuff like that."
53,118,Lauren,"Oh, we should talk about modal verbs."
53,119,Gretchen,Yeah! We should do a whole episode about modals.
53,120,Lauren,"With evidentiality, which is something we've done a whole episode on, there is a lot of discussion about --"
53,121,Gretchen,Which is your favourite thing.
53,122,Lauren,"Which is one of my favourite things. There's a whole discussion about whether evidentiality is its own category separate from mode, or if it sits within a more lumper definition of 'mode,' or whether we split it off as its own, or if it sits in a subcategory. It reminds me a lot about how I imagine the early discussions around biological classification must've happened."
53,123,Gretchen,"Because at a certain point you're like, okay, so we need to have all of these different sorts of levels of 'Are these just different species of birds or are they all birds together? Here we've got the mammals. Here we've got' -- I'm not a biologist; I'm not gonna torture this metaphor too far -- but which of the things are more closely related? Which are the things that are more distantly related? There's several levels here, but some of them you're like, 'Well, they just needed to come up with another name for this.' It's useful to have a name as a handle so that we're all talking about the same thing, but sometimes those names don't always have a very good etymological reason for why they're called that thing in particular. Sometimes it's just like, 'Well, we needed a name for this group.'"
53,124,Lauren,"And sometimes a level -- because there are classes in biological animal kingdom hierarchies, right. So, the word 'class' there has a really specific meaning, whereas we could just talk about a general class of objects or a particular class of students. It has all these different meanings. I think 'mode' is one of those similar words that has lots of different meanings but in linguistics tends to have this specific meaning."
53,125,Gretchen,"Yeah. And this is a thing that academic disciplines, especially, in the natural philosophy vibe of categorising the world and trying to figure out which things are more related to each other tends to go into common words and say, 'Ah, we're gonna come up with a technical definition for this one,' and be like, 'Well, technically, this is what a reptile is now,' or like, 'Technically, this is what a mood is now. This is what a mode is.' You end up with this situation where the technical definitions and the vernacular definitions co-exist. That can sometimes lead to almost more confusion where you're like, 'I need to figure out, first of all, is this person using the technical meaning right now or are they using the vernacular meaning. Which one am I trying to use? Which one is appropriate for this context?' In addition to 'What is this word?' Whereas, sometimes, if there's an entirely new word for something, it's just like, 'Oh, well, I've learned this new word and it refers to this specific thing and it always refers to that.' There isn't this competing vernacular definition that also exists. The way that this often gets taught in classrooms is like, 'Well, the vernacular version you learned is wrong. This is the real definition.' But I think we're interested in describing language and saying, descriptively, people use 'mode' in all sorts of different ways -- people use 'mood' in all sorts of different ways. It's just that in certain contexts there's this one very particular definition that it's used with in this one case. Oh, 'case,' that's another one. Look, you can use 'case' to mean a whole lot of things! There's one technical linguistic meaning of it, but there's also a lot of other ways you could use 'case.' Sometimes the metaphor goes in the other direction. Sometimes a word gets borrowed from grammatical terminology into the more generic life circumstances as well. 'Gender' initially referred to just a class, like a genre, and then it gets used in a vernacular sense as well."
53,126,Lauren,"I have a sense that imperative -- if something is very important, it's 'imperative' -- came from the urgency of a command as well."
53,127,Gretchen,"That's possible. The idea of like, okay, well, this is this particular grammatical thing but also can get used metaphorically for the whole related set of ideas."
53,128,Lauren,"In much the same way that the Linnaean biological classification system owes a lot to Latin terminology and that Western tradition of classification, I can't help but feel that part of the reason we have a category of imperatives is because, as you mentioned earlier, Latin happens to have a very clear imperative form of the verb. I wonder what would've happened to a grammatical tradition and how we classify modality and mode and imperatives if we started with a language that didn't have those structures."
53,129,Gretchen,"I think it's a difficult to answer question, but it's a really valid question. I found Latin has a reputation of like, 'Oh, I didn't understand grammar until I studied Latin.' That's not because other languages don't have grammar. It's because a lot of our grammatical terminology was invented specifically for Latin and to work really well with Latin. Then you end up learning about how English grammar works because you learn Latin in a very translate-y sort of way, and you learn what the reflexes are of particular English-y things in Latin or of things in another language in Latin. It feels like Latin grammar is easier because the grammar as we learn it was invented to fit Latin really well."
53,130,Lauren,"As someone who didn't study Latin, I'm very happy to say that I didn't understand English grammar until I studied linguistics. It achieves similar ends but from a very different perspective."
53,131,Gretchen,"I think, having studied both Latin and linguistics, there's a sense in which the grammar of Latin is very catalogued in many cases, it's very pinned down, because it's not a language that's actively being spoken by people. It has been finitely described. The thing that excites me about linguistics is you can approach grammar in this more experimental way where you can say things like, 'Is the imperative really valid in this language?' Or 'Does this language have a prohibitive?' 'Is this useful categorization to make?' 'Is this a useful distinction to make?' That's something that's less the case when you're talking about one very well-described language and something that's more the case when you're trying to figure out, okay, how do languages compare with each other or what's going on in language in general or what else is going on here or what's going on in the language that isn't as well described. It's a more expansive look at how grammar can work than just like, okay, here's a list of all the stuff you learned. You can be trying to figure out what's going on with grammar."
53,132,Lauren,"One of the joys of the imperative, as we said, it's really relatively uncomplex grammatically across a lot of different languages and that it's so interactively complicated and fascinating. I think that's what keeps bringing me back to this category."
53,133,Gretchen,"Which makes it a good introduction to the idea of, okay, how could we do these categories? What does it mean for a verb to have a 'mood' or a 'mode'? Whereas something like with the subjunctive, which is another mood, is harder to wrap your head around. If you're trying to get a handle on both of things at the same time, it can be overwhelming. Whereas the imperative is a good slice to break off of 'Here's this thing that we know how to do the command thing. Someone wrote a YA novel about it in 1997.' But also, it's this gateway into considering this broader question of like, yeah, what sort of vibes can the verbs have. [Music]"

54,1,Gretchen,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics! I'm Gretchen McCulloch."
54,2,Lauren,"I'm Lauren Gawne. Today we're getting enthusiastic about how grammars come into existence. But first, we are doing a liveshow in April. We will be doing a liveshow recording on the internet so that we can all be in the same place at the same time on Saturday the 24th of April, Eastern Daylight Savings Time in North America, which will be early on a Sunday morning for us here Australia."
54,3,Gretchen,That'll be 6:00 p.m. for me on Eastern Daylight Time. We will include a link to a time zone converter so you can figure out when that is for you.
54,4,Lauren,"We'll be doing the whole show about backchanneling, which is all those ways that you --"
54,5,Gretchen,Mm-hmm.
54,6,Lauren,"-- actively listen to someone as they're talking. Thank you for that excellent backchanneling, Gretchen. Something I think a lot about in our era of lots of video calls and online chats."
54,7,Gretchen,"You can't see me, but I'm doing a thumbs up right now."
54,8,Lauren,Excellent backchanneling.
54,9,Gretchen,"These are some kinds of backchanneling. We're gonna be talking about lots more.

54,16,Lauren,That's 'comm' with two Ms. [Music]
54,17,Gretchen,"Lauren, how many people would you say you know who have written a grammar of a language?"
54,18,Lauren,"Hmm, okay, well, both my PhD supervisors. I'd say half the people in the department that I current work in. I have written a grammar of a language. This is a perfectly common activity among my professional cohort. I assume it's a thing most people do and know about, so we don't really have to explain it for this episode at all. This is fine."
54,19,Gretchen,"[Laughs] Yeah, I would say that at least several of the people that I went to grad school with -- not necessarily at my university -- people I knew from conferences, professors that I knew -- one professor I knew had her grammar come out the same year that her baby came out, and she posted a photo of the grammar and the baby, which were about the same size, on Facebook after that happened. It was really cute."
54,20,Lauren,Grammars definitely take longer than nine months to gestate. I can definitely confirm that.
54,21,Gretchen,"I have not written a grammar. So, when someone's going about writing a grammar, what -- okay, here's a language. There isn't a grammar written or the grammar that's written of it is not adequate. What do I do to start?"
54,22,Lauren,"What you're talking about is taking all of the amazing complexity of how humans use language and finding the rules that reoccur within a particular language and then finding a way of articulating that concisely in written form in a grammar so that, by the end, you've worked through most of the common features you find in this language -- all of the variations and irregularities -- and you've put that into some kind of readable book format for other people to then learn about how the grammar of this language works. That is the overarching aim of this endeavour."
54,23,Gretchen,"I've consulted grammars in the process of doing linguistics. I have the Cambridge Grammar of the English Language sitting on my desk. When I was in grad school, I spent a lot of time consulting Valentine (2001)'s grammar of Nishnaabemwin. There are grammars that I've consulted. They're 1,000 pages, 2,000 pages long. Sometimes you've got a really massive grammar. Sometimes you get a shorter sketch grammar. They have certain similarities in the structure and the types of things that people cover in a grammar."
54,24,Lauren,"Absolutely. You tend to start, traditionally, with smaller bits and work upwards. You're likely to find a description, if it's a spoken language, of the sound system or, if it's a signed language, of the hand shape and body space phonology at the beginning of the book and then work up to word-level -- you probably expect if a language has adjectives, a section on adjectives, which we've talked about before."
54,25,Gretchen,We have talked a little bit about adjectives.
54,26,Lauren,"And then if you're look at sentence-level stuff, like asking a question, how you do that, it happens at the level of the sentence, that tends to be more towards the end. You're going from smaller bits up to bigger bits. It really depends on the tradition. We talked about lumpers and splitters before. If you like to split things down, a grammar is great because you can have so many sub-headings. I remember reading the rules for one set of grammars where it was like, 'Please do not go beyond five layers of headings,' and I was like, 'That's actually quite a challenge.'"
54,27,Gretchen,"Because you have your chapter level headings, and then you're like, 'Oh, okay, if this chapter's about verbs, you've got this type of verbs and those type of verbs -- within the transitive verbs, you've got this type of verbs and those type of verbs,' and so on and so forth."
54,28,Lauren,"Then you've got the irregularities. They might need their own subset. You can go from -- the table of contents, you can get this big picture and then go down and down and down into the different sections. The grammar that I wrote of Lamjung Yolmo was a sketch grammar, so it's only a couple of hundred pages. It makes sure to knock over -- it would be very weird to have nothing about nouns in a language that very obviously has nouns -- but it doesn't go into the deep level of detail on some things that a longer grammar gets to. There's always more to be done as well."
54,29,Gretchen,"Any grammar is gonna be incomplete -- even these massive doorstop-sized grammars. You're gonna leave some stuff out where you're a speaker and you're like, 'I know this,' but you don't necessarily include it in a grammar. I've also read, in grad school -- I don't remember what language it was of -- but I picked up this grammar that was written in, like, I wanna say maybe the 70s or 80s. There was clearly some sort of fad for doing this very abstract schematic thing of sentences or verbs or something. It didn't have any complete sentences or complete verbs just written there. It drew them all on this diagram that I have never encountered before or since where everything was piece-able together. I was like, 'Oh, wow. You're participating in some sort of grammatical tradition that I'm just not aware of here.'"
54,30,Lauren,"I mean, I think the important thing is that grammars are written by humans, and humans are trained by other humans within particular traditions. I remember when I was building my sketch grammar, it was while I was also working on my thesis because I was looking specifically at evidentials, but you can't know what's happening with evidentiality without understanding how verbs work and how verbs relate to other parts of the sentence. And then I realised I was accidentally on my way to writing out the bones of the grammar of Lamjung Yolmo."
54,31,Gretchen,Sometimes you just accidentally write a grammar.
54,32,Lauren,"That is how I accidentally started and very deliberately finished writing that sketch grammar. But I remember talking to my supervisors. One of them found it quite unusual that I wanted to include the methodology in my grammar. I wanted to explain specifically who I'd worked with, what I'd recorded, what kinds of elicitation I'd used. That wasn't in that supervisor's grammar tradition, but it was something I wanted to include."
54,33,Gretchen,"A lot of grammars aren't gonna include the gestures of the language or something, which I know is one of your things that you enjoy."
54,34,Lauren,"Yes. There are traditions that do focus more on narrative structure, and you might find more about the structure of narratives in a grammar, and others that focus more on verb structure. There's a very brief few pages on phonetics and then a really massive chapter on verbs. It's sometimes because the language has lots of really fun, complex things happening with the verbs, but sometimes it's just because that's what that person was interested in."
54,35,Gretchen,This person was a verb fan.
54,36,Lauren,Yeah.
54,37,Gretchen,"Some parts, you know, it'd be pretty hard to do a grammar without doing some level of phonology at the beginning. But, yeah, what level of pragmatic stuff at the end, discourse stuff, or like, 'How do people of this language talk to children?' or something like that -- that might not be in a grammar."
54,38,Lauren,"I'm doing a paper with a colleague on onomatopoeia at the moment. Some grammars will have a separate section on that. Because it's not as central to every single sentence as, say, nouns and verbs can be for a lot of languages, it doesn't tend to crop up as its own specific subsection in a lot of grammars."
54,39,Gretchen,Which doesn't necessarily mean that language doesn't have onomatopoeia. It's just that it didn't get the focused attention that got put there.
54,40,Lauren,"This is always the question that you have while reading a grammar, right. It's about what makes it in, but it's also what doesn't. Sometimes things don't make it in because of trends or because of what people are focusing on or sometimes just because they're important but incredibly low-frequency things that happen. Or if someone is doing fieldwork, and they come into a community as a man, they might spend a lot of time around other men and recording a particular variety. That's where the methodology was really important for me to make clear why I was making choices. Also, the title of a grammar -- I find it really interesting whether people say, 'The Grammar of' or 'A Grammar of.' I, very consciously, called it, 'A Grammar' or 'A Sketch Grammar of Lamjung Yolmo' because this is just my analysis and my take. Other people might come to exactly the same data with different conclusions. Or they might be way more into adjectives than I am, and that section is way more fleshed out in someone else's analysis."
54,41,Gretchen,"That's an interesting side effect, as you were saying about, okay, well, if we wanna look at onomatopoeia in a bunch of languages, or if you wanna look at any sort of thing whether it's verbs or sounds or handshapes or something in a bunch of different languages, okay, how can -- if you're making those beautiful graphs like are in the WALS database, which we've mentioned before, or if you're gonna write a Wikipedia article about like, 'Here's how this language works,' or 'Here's how this phenomenon works,' the grammars turn into this input material of what gets cited there."
54,42,Lauren,"Those big overviews are often built up from these grammars of different languages. That's where having structures that are easy for people to access in the table of contents becomes really easy because, just as a human writing the grammar, there's another human reading that grammar to put into those databases."
54,43,Gretchen,"Dictionaries are often a very collaborative project where you have a bunch of people contributing words or contributing entries. You can say, 'Okay, you need to take care of the letter P and see what's going on here.' But a grammar is often written by one person, and so it reflects that one person."
54,44,Lauren,"Almost, like the very overwhelming majority of the time, it's people who aren't members of that community. It's a linguist who's trained as a linguist and then come into this community and often built incredibly long-term, deep relationships with those communities and speak the language but not always. I know I'm kind of -- it's very easy to over-problematise something you do and spend a lot of time thinking about but, again, it's worth remembering while reading a grammar."
54,45,Gretchen,"Right. And what types of things you think are interesting, what types of things you think are novel or worth drawing attention to, or what types of things you think are common is a function of what you've been exposed to from a grammatical tradition. I've been thinking a lot about this question of 'What do we put in a grammar' and 'How is a grammar constructed by the societal context in which it's written' because I've been reading this book called, Grammar West to East, by Edward McDonald. The subtitle is 'The Investigation of Linguistic Meaning in European and Chinese Traditions.'"
54,46,Lauren,Cool.
54,47,Gretchen,"I will say, at the beginning, this is an academic book. It is a monograph. If you don't have a background in linguistics, you'll find it fairly dense going, potentially. But, as someone who does, it's really interesting."
54,48,Lauren,Awesome! Pick out the anecdotes for us.
54,49,Gretchen,"One of the first observations that it makes -- and, when you think about this, it's totally true -- is that -- so the European grammatical tradition is based on Latin and Greek. Latin and Greek are languages where you do a lot of changing the endings on words -- sometimes the prefixes, but often the endings -- on words to make them do grammatical things. The European grammatical tradition is a lot about making tables of all of the different ways that a word can inflect and being like, 'Well, it does this and it does this,' and giving names to the different sorts of groupings and patterns that you find out of that."
54,50,Lauren,"Which is great, but doing those things, it makes it a little bit confusing sometimes when you apply it to a language like English that doesn't have the same ending changes, but we give them the same labels. That's because the analysis of English is very much in that Latin tradition."
54,51,Gretchen,"It's inherited from the Latin tradition. There's a pedagogical motivation for some of this because Latin and Greek were not just the languages that started out analysing themselves, although they were that as well, but they were also considered prestigious languages that you needed to learn. So, a lot of the grammatical analysis of Greek and especially Latin were in terms of how to teach them to speakers of other European languages. And it's like, 'Here's a bunch of endings, and you need to learn them, and you need to learn what they correspond to and what their function is.'"
54,52,Lauren,Right.
54,53,Gretchen,"What's interesting is that the grammar of Chinese is different from that. They don't do endings. What they do instead is you have things that have a grammatical function, but they're considered to have the same status as full words. And so, the Chinese grammatical tradition is concerned with looking at those particles that have grammatical functions but are hard to write definitions of and cataloguing them and figuring out what's going on with them and grouping them into groups. There are some words in the European tradition that are invariant -- they're often all lumped together in 'adjectives' -- words like 'often,' or 'always,' or something like that, which are -- they just look like that all the time. They don't have endings like the verbs and the nouns do. The Latin tradition grammarians didn't care about those words, and they were really into the endings. The Chinese grammarians were really interested in, first of all, this fundamental duality between words that had a meaning to them, had what they called, 'full words,' and words that were only for their grammatical function, what they called, 'empty words.'"
54,54,Lauren,That is a great metaphor. I like it.
54,55,Gretchen,"Also, because culturally they were really interested in dualities, you know, the sun and the moon, and the full words and the empty words, and having a nice, mirrored duality was really appealing to them for aesthetic reasons in the same way that the European grammatical tradition is often descended from the rhetorical tradition because they were really interested in the aesthetics of rhetoric when it came to doing that sort of analysis. What your culture's into aesthetically brings forth, okay, what are we trying to explain this. So, both of these are sort of ancient history, you know. Around 2,000 years ago they were the beginnings of this doing their own analysis grammatical traditions. You get this really interesting descriptive grammar that was published in 1898 by China's first grammarian, Ma Jianzhong, called, Mr Ma's Compleat Grammar, which I think is great."
54,56,Lauren,That is an excellent late-1800s name of a book.
54,57,Gretchen,"It is exactly of a particular era. It's 'compleat,' E-A-T, not E-T-E, which is just --"
54,58,Lauren,Perfect.
54,59,Gretchen,"He was a native speaker of Chinese who had also been educated by Jesuits in French, and so he had exposure to both the French and the Chinese grammatical traditions. He writes this grammar where he distinguishes between full and empty words the way that the Chinese had -- introduced these particles to be these 'empty words' -- but he also further subdivides the full words into the lexical categories that Europeans had been doing, which are verbs and nouns and so on. This distinction between verbs and nouns and so on was really important to the Europeans because verbs and nouns have different types of endings. You know whether something's a verb or a noun because the endings are all different because this is a really endings-based grammatical system. The modern linguistic conception of how languages and their structures work is, to a certain extent, a hybrid of that because these full and empty grammatical categories is now reflected in what linguists call, 'content words' and 'function words.'"
54,60,Lauren,Yes.
54,61,Gretchen,"You have words like, 'dog,' and 'cat,' and 'run,' and 'see,' and stuff like that where you can actually write a definition, and then you have your grammatical words like 'of,' and 'is,' and 'to,' and stuff, which just have this grammatical function. So, this category that's still really relevant in modern linguistics is there in one country's grammatical tradition, but also modern linguistics does also still talk about 'nouns' and 'verbs.'"
54,62,Lauren,Absolutely.
54,63,Gretchen,"The history of the contact between these two grammatical traditions and how they figured out how to adapt things to each other is an interesting way of looking at what is it that we think of as important when we're trying to write a grammar of a particular language or we're trying to do grammar. A lot of ancient grammar traditions were really concerned with describing one very prestigious, golden-age language -- or one or two -- you've gotta write your grammar of Latin or of Greek or of Old Chinese because that's the one everyone thinks is fancy. And the local vernacular that ordinary peoples talk, like, no, no one's gonna write a grammar of that. It's a very interesting way of thinking about, okay, what were people concerned about and how did those interests derive from the structure of the language or languages that they were familiar with."
54,64,Lauren,"This book sounds so great, but I wonder if actually the title of it should be, 'Grammars from East to West,' because if we look where our modern tradition of writing grammars in Europe is, it's very much motivated by those Latin grammars and grammarians of old, but it's also very influenced by Paṇini and the Sanskrit grammarian tradition that is two-and-a-half, three thousand years old as well."
54,65,Gretchen,"One of the things that I was thinking about reading this, being like, 'Wow!' -- I knew some of the stuff about the European tradition, not all of it, but I didn't know most of the stuff about ancient China -- thinking, 'I know that there was a really interesting grammatical tradition going on in India, like, right between these two major geographical regions.' There's a bunch of stuff going on in Arabic as well, at a slightly later time. Can I have a book that writes about all four of these, please, in comparison to each other?"
54,66,Lauren,"Yeah. I know very little about the Arabic tradition. Most linguists at least know the name 'Paṇini' That first N has a little dot under it in English, so it has a kind of palatalised vibe, but it also means his name is great. I know more than one university that has the 'Paṇini Café and Sandwich Shop' because that's a great multilingual pun to use."
54,67,Gretchen,"Who can resist a pun? I learned a bit about the Arabic grammatical tradition when I was taking a bit of Arabic in undergrad. There are a whole bunch of things that that grammatical tradition does also in the tradition of 'We're going to look at our language and catalogue it in exhaustive detail and figure out exactly what's going on in it.' One of the things that I remember was that there's an exhaustive catalysation of what they call the 'binyan,' which are the templates that you can slot your three-consonant roots into, and how you put the vowels in between them that mean all of these different things."
54,68,Lauren,Because Arabic is very interested in what happens in shifting the vowels of the language rather than what happens at the end of a word like the Latin tradition.
54,69,Gretchen,"It's very relevant in Arabic all of the different things you can do with the vowels in between them and whether, maybe, you double a consonant in a particular context or you put this vowel here or that vowel there. The classic tri-consonantal root that everybody cites is K-T-B, /k/-/t/-/b/, which has to do with books and writing. 'Kitab' is 'a book,' and 'kutub' is 'books,' and 'maktab is 'office,' and 'kataba' is 'He writes.' You can do all sorts of things with those three consonants and how you arrange the vowels between them. There's an abstract way of representing 'Here's what the patterns are' with a template verb that you can show all the patterns with and going through and exhaustively cataloguing the patterns. This is the exciting thing to do if you're an ancient Arabic grammarian. I'm excited by just thinking about it. But that's very much influenced by the structure of the language. I don't know as much about what Paṇini was doing except for the fact that he gets cited in a lot of Intro Linguistics classes as the first grammarian."
54,70,Lauren,"Part of why he gets cited a lot is because he's excellent. I'll talk about that. I think part of why as well is that Paṇini synthesized and brought together everything that had been happening in the Sanskrit grammar tradition. Sanskrit is kind of like the Indian linguistic area equivalent of Latin, which is that it was the language of sacred texts and religion. It's a language that is still handed down. People still learn Sanskrit in the way they learn Latin. But in that area, languages like Hindi and Nepali, the Indo-Aryan languages, are all later siblings and children of Sanskrit. It's a very convenient analogy to Latin to draw with Sanskrit. I think, also, the motivation for thinking a lot about the language came from a theological attempt within Hinduism to understand truth through language and understand how language works. It was one of the core areas of study within the larger religious tradition. So, that was the motivation. But Paṇini -- we know his name. We know not too much else about him except that he wrote at least two-and-a-half thousand years ago. He synthesized this work, and he name drops ten other people whose work he draws on. We've lost the record of all of their work. I think he's excellent. That's not in dispute. But it's also just a convenient prominence he receives through being the kind of earliest record we have when the work was going on for thousands of years behand."
54,71,Gretchen,The person whose manuscript survives with his name attached to it.
54,72,Lauren,Absolutely. A very convenient way to appear to be very excellent is just to have none of the foundational work you draw on exist still.
54,73,Gretchen,No. This is like the Library of Alexandria all over again.
54,74,Lauren,"What made Paṇini's approach really distinct -- and distinct from what was happening with those learner-driven motivations for analysing Latin -- is that there was a logical progress to how he set out his description of Sanskrit. Similar to what we talked about with modern grammars where you start with the base elements of the sound system and then build up to words and parts of words. If something goes on a word after another bit, so you'll describe the earlier bits first and build outwards. It's this logical order and progression."
54,75,Gretchen,"In a very real sense, the order that Paṇini devised over 2,500 years ago is reflected in the order of the grammar that you wrote a few years ago?"
54,76,Lauren,"It's absolutely not an accident. The early 20th Century linguists like Saussure, Franz Bopp, where directly reading Paṇini and going, 'This guy was doing this stuff thousands of years before we started thinking about it' and were directly influenced by Paṇini's approach to thinking about how the language worked and thinking about it very descriptively. This is why he's known as the first grammarian within even the Western tradition because he was like, 'Look, there's these words and they have these histories, but actually, the important thing is that we think about how the words are being used by people now.' The funny thing is he wrote that about what we now think of as Classic Sanskrit. People have not moved on from thinking about Classical Sanskrit in that way, and it's become a learning tool, but --"
54,77,Gretchen,We should all just be speaking Classical Sanskrit.
54,78,Lauren,"The motivation is exactly the same motivation we use in a descriptive grammar now. It's not about setting out the rules of a language and how it has to work, it reflects how a linguist has analysed that people are using that system."
54,79,Gretchen,"I think that's one of the things that comes up when we talk about a grammar is, particularly because grammar in the Western tradition is associated with Latin, and, okay, you're learning about the grammar of English only so that you can translation Latin into English better rather than learning about the grammar of English as an object of its own study. This translates into, 'Okay, well, what if we made the grammar of English more like Latin because that would obviously be better.' That's where this secondary meaning of 'grammar' as, you know, 'Thou shalt not split an infinitive,' does -- because in Latin an infinitive is all just one word. You can't split it. It's just one word."
54,80,Lauren,You can't split it.
54,81,Gretchen,"This idea that grammar is a tool to beat people over the head with comes from this, 'Well, you've got to learn this language in school because this is how you're gonna access all these classical texts that you are supposed to access, and you need to do it a certain way because it's dead now, and it's not evolving, and so you're just learning to do this very particular thing,' that's where this additional connotation of grammar as a stick to beat people over the head with comes in."
54,82,Lauren,That's that very Latin tradition that we still have.
54,83,Gretchen,"And it's not only English that had a grammar as a tool to stay in touch with a lost golden age. This is also what they were doing in ancient Chinese of like, here's this older thing. One of the other interesting things that I learned about the Chinese grammatical tradition, in particular with the writing system -- because the writing system in Chinese can obscure different pronunciations -- you could have a poem that you could still read in the written sense that's very old but, for a modern reader, it doesn't necessarily rhyme. At a certain point, when they were doing more historical linguistics, they realised, 'Oh, this poem actually rhymed back in the day.' The pronunciation has changed so much that we weren't really thinking about it because the characters look the same, but it actually used to rhyme, which sometimes shows up when you're reading Shakespeare or something, and it's got 'thrown' and 'drown' or something. Like, 'Wait, those probably were supposed to rhyme based on where they are in this poem.' You can use that to reconstruct what was going on."
54,84,Lauren,"It can feel a bit anxiety-provoking about committing an analysis to paper because you are pinning a butterfly for a moment in time. People are still speaking the language, and it moves on. As long as you don't think of the descriptive grammar as anything more canonical and authoritative than people's actual intuitions, that's an important thing to remember. Especially if you're working with a grammar that's more than a few generations old, it may be that the person didn't quite capture what people were doing. It may be that the language has changed again."
54,85,Gretchen,"Another thing that I found really interesting about 'What are the ideas that people were thinking about at the time' -- so this is from Grammar West to East again. The author points out that when Chinese characters first became known in Europe, it was late 16th Century and, in Europe, for unrelated reasons, the idea of a universal language was the hot philosophical topic. You had people like John Wilkins, who ultimately created Roget's Thesaurus, but he was really just trying to make a universal taxonomy for understanding the world, he ended up making quite a nice thesaurus but not with making a universal way of understanding the world. What was actually going on in China at the time was that Classical Chinese was a scholarly and diplomatic lingua franca of the East Asian region. It was acquired as a learned language in the different parts of those regions. The Chinese words were given a local pronunciation. So, children in different parts of China would learn to read using a literary register of the local dialect, and there wasn't the idea of a standard spoken language for the whole country. That's a modern innovation. This is a situation that was a lot like Latin in Europe at the time. But Europe, you know, 'Oh, you learn Latin in school so that you can do the literary thing.' But European scholars misunderstood the situation and thought that this meant that Chinese characters were interpretable by speakers of any language without them being based on one language, even though they were very much based on an ancestral language of the region."
54,86,Lauren,Oh dear. And their obsession with universality that they came to this very functional but still based on a language thing. Oh dear. I see exactly where this is going. That's not good.
54,87,Gretchen,"Also, they did the same thing with the Egyptian hieroglyphs, which had not yet been deciphered yet. They were like, 'Guys, we found it! We found the universal language of ideas, and it's not tied to a particular language!'"
54,88,Lauren,Not translated adds an extra air of mystery.
54,89,Gretchen,"European scholars thought this was great. Francis Bacon thought this was amazing. It's interesting to see not just, okay, here's this thing that was going on in China at the time, which is interesting, but also, here's how these things get reflected and refracted, whether that's the Europeans approaching Chinese grammar as maybe this is a thing that's universal or this Chinese grammarian, Mr Ma, looking at it and saying, 'Okay, how can I merge these two grammatical traditions of the full words versus the empty words?', and then also 'What if I have nouns and adjectives and stuff?', and 'How could I group them in ways that make sense for the grammar of the language?' Everyone's bringing their own preconceived notions to this space."
54,90,Lauren,"I think the descriptive grammar has really figured itself out as a genre in the 20th Century. A lot of the discussion around how to make sure people aren't just bringing themselves to it has been to widen the scope of what gets included. One really big influence has been the idea that you need to have the grammar, but it has to be presented alongside the wordlists because the grammar just tells you the rules not which words go in which places and also a collection of texts that are broken down and translated so that people can access what's happening in narratives. That solves a little bit of that what gets included problem."
54,91,Gretchen,"Because somebody could always go back and look at the text again and say, 'Well, what if I interpreted them differently or wrote this grammar differently based on what I can see here in this longer thing?'"
54,92,Lauren,"Yeah. 'The author didn't get around to a section on the use of particles in narratives, but there's enough texts here I can see what's happening.' This little trio of publications is sometimes known as the 'Boasian trinity,' which sounds a little bit more pompous and religious than it actually is, but it's part of this expanding what gets included."
54,93,Gretchen,"This is after Boas, whose first name I have forgotten."
54,94,Lauren,Franz Boas.
54,95,Gretchen,"Franz? Franz Boas. He was one of the early grammarians in this descriptive and comparative tradition where it's not just, okay, every intellectual in this one country or this one society is devoting themselves to this one language but, 'Oh, what if we looked at lots of languages? What if we compared them?' This goes along with the colonial project of like, 'What if we went and conquered some people?'"
54,96,Lauren,"Yes, there's a lot of scientific rationalism happening here."
54,97,Gretchen,"This is not entirely unproblematic either. It is interesting how the forms of the grammars start shifting when it stops being this sort of seeking this one language of like, 'Oh, everything descends from Greek' or 'Everything descends from Sanskrit.' Even the Europeans, at a certain point, when they encountered Sanskrit, were like, 'Oh, everything must descend from Sanskrit,' and said, 'Okay, well, what if we realised that we can't actually know what the first language was? This is lost in the midst of time,' and figured out 'What can we know about relationships and what is the possibility space for what are different things that languages do?'"
54,98,Lauren,"I mean, I think it's also worth pointing out a lot of 20th Century language description has happened to try and translate religious texts and political documents and that is a subset of problematic colonisation within the grammatical tradition."
54,99,Gretchen,"The longest text that's been written down in a lot of languages is the Bible, which has all sorts of really weird consequences when you start using those parallel texts as the input for something like machine translation because you can have machine translation systems start spitting out things that sound like religious prophecies because they're just regurgitation versions of that Bible input, which is pretty weird."
54,100,Lauren,Such a weird consequence of a weird set of earlier decisions.
54,101,Gretchen,"Exactly. Here was this earlier decision that maybe this was even a religious text that was created 100 years ago by some missionary, but it's the longest text that's available in this language, and the grammar is more or less accurate -- and yet. It wasn't trying to record the stories and the oral histories of the people who actually spoke that language that they cared about themselves, it was trying to introduce this foreign religion to them."
54,102,Lauren,"Again, it's one of those things that is hard to avoid and so it's just important to be aware of when you're looking at some grammars. They may have a lot of Christian religious texts. It doesn't necessarily reflect the religion of the speakers so much as the religion of the person doing the documentation."
54,103,Gretchen,Going back to that theme of grammars that are made by people and sometimes people's agendas for making a grammar is --
54,104,Lauren,A different endpoint.
54,105,Gretchen,"It's less about like, 'Oh, I want to help this language be taught in schools and support its speakers in their own goals' and more 'I wanna impose my goals on the speakers.'"
54,106,Lauren,"I think another important change that has happened across the 20th Century in terms of grammars is the increasing availability of recording equipment and, therefore, the ability to make recordings of the language as a fourth part of that three-part collection of what's important when documenting a language."
54,107,Gretchen,There are some really interesting ancient recording technologies like the wax cylinders that were used --
54,108,Lauren,"You say, 'ancient,' but you mean, like, 150 years ago."
54,109,Gretchen,"Yeah, not ancient compared to Paṇini."
54,110,Lauren,"Not Paṇini ancient, just, it's really that the story of the 20th Century descriptive tradition is the story of embracing these recording methods."
54,111,Gretchen,"There was a really cool thing where they had these old, cracked wax cylinders, I think it was in the Smithsonian, and they couldn't put them on a machine to read them because, obviously, the needle would stumble over the cracks. It's kind of like a record."
54,112,Lauren,They just fall apart.
54,113,Gretchen,"Picture it as a tall record with all the lines tall rather than a flat record. But it was cracked, so they couldn't put it in the thing, and they eventually figured out a way with lasers to read the recordings. I got to hear, you know, here's a song in this language that hasn't been heard for 100 years because the cylinder cracked. If it's online, I'll try to find a link to it."
54,114,Lauren,"With recording technology, early on, and even for some linguists, it's mostly about doing recordings so you can go back and listen yourself and really identify that you're correctly analysing structures. But I think the more exciting thing is that it lets you really observe more people using language in more natural ways. The 'Can you say this?', 'Can you say that?', 'Does that sound grammatical?' way of eliciting stuff can lead to an unusual way of approaching the language, but really drawing on people singing songs and telling stories not only makes for a richer, more realistic grammatical description that allows you to see those fuzzier, more complicated bits of language, but it also means that you can make those recordings available for speakers who are interested in going back to an oral history of the language for people who might come in the future and go, 'Ah, you didn't look at the way people's prosody goes up and down and their intonation changes in stories. I'm gonna look at that, and I have access to these recordings.' I think this is where grammars are more exciting as we integrate more of that richness of actual language and bringing the people who speak the language back into real prominence within the grammar document."
54,115,Gretchen,"Yeah. Because there is a certain way of writing a grammar which is very old which just assumes that whatever bits you have about 'Here's how this language works,' that information just exists at this abstract level, and it's not necessarily tied to particular speakers or particular communities, and saying, 'Oh, it would be good to give credit to the speakers who were saying this, or to identify this is a particular way that a language is spoken in a particular region,' or 'Here's something that's going on here.' There have been some initiatives to do things like pair people who are trying to revitalise their languages with linguists to try to understand what's going on in some of these older grammars because they can be hard to decipher without the special training. The one that I'm familiar with is Breath of Life."
54,116,Lauren,"There are the Paper and Talk Workshops in Australia as well where you're coming full circle and making sure that you give people the tools that they need to access the materials about their own language because you can make grammars for many reasons, and we've discussed some of them but, at the end of the day, the most important reason to me is that speakers of a language can access the materials that were created for that language."
54,117,Gretchen,"I think when we look at the multi-thousand-year-old history of making grammars and the very different sorts of questions that people had about language thousands of years ago, I find it very humbling because we can think about what are the questions that people might be asking in another thousand years, and how can we make things that would help with that?

55,1,Lauren,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics! I'm Lauren Gawne."
55,2,Gretchen,"I'm Gretchen McCulloch. Today we're getting enthusiastic about R and R-like sounds, also known as 'rhoticity.' But first, we have a liveshow!

55,4,Gretchen,"It was really good that it was my turn to say what this episode was about because if you said the topic 'R and R-like sounds,' Lauren, I feel like you might say it a little bit differently."
55,5,Lauren,I don't know what's wrong with talking about '/a/-like' sounds.
55,6,Gretchen,'/a/-like sounds' is a vowel.
55,7,Lauren,"That is definitely convenient that you were the person to introduce this topic because rhoticity and this R-ness is something I can do, and I can definitely do it at the start of words like 'red' or 'rice,' but it's a sound that is missing from the ends of words for me. So, it definitely is easier to hear exactly what we're talking about with '/ɹoʊtɪsɪti/.' I can do it at the start, but when I'm talking about /aɹɹɹ/, I really have to work it to articulate that."
55,8,Gretchen,"Welcome to International Talk Like a Pirate Day, Lauren, 'Arrrrrrgh' is this whole episode."
55,9,Lauren,I get a bit over-enthusiastic with putting it in there for sure.
55,10,Gretchen,"The nice thing is, is because this feature of English accents where some of them do pronounce the Rs after the vowels and some of them don't is a feature of English accents that is one of the big accent splits that we have in English. We also don't have to listen to me trying to do the bad impression of non-rhotic people saying, '/a/, /a/ and /a/-like sounds.'"
55,11,Lauren,Our entire podcasting collaboration has really led up to this episode. This is entirely what our accent distribution was made for.
55,12,Gretchen,"It was totally made for this. It's a really salient feature across English accents that some of them do have this R after a vowel -- 'post-vocalic R' -- and some of them don't. In English, that's what gets called 'rhoticity.' Is this accent rhotic like mine or is it non-rhotic like yours?"
55,13,Lauren,The class of R-like sounds is something we'll be talking about all episode because it's a bit of a grab bag both within English and across languages more broadly.
55,14,Gretchen,"What exactly we mean by an R-like sound is one of those nebulous, squishy categories that it seems like it makes sense and then you look at it too hard and then it stops making sense and then you realise that you can drift your mind into soft focus and have it make sense again. One of the things that I enjoyed learning about English accents is how is it that in Canada we have this R and down in Australia you don't have it. Where does that come from?"
55,15,Lauren,"It's a really nice example of how migration creates these little accent time capsules. The R sound is something that's very easy to lose from the ends of words. Across languages this happens. It's a very easy target for something to get lost. It was far more common in England four centuries ago when a lot of people migrated. The areas that people migrated from in England and the British Isles and the United Kingdom, more generally, people migrated to what is now the United States and Canada. They had more of this R at the end of words as a feature. Then a couple of centuries later, when the colonists arrived in Australia from the United Kingdom, that feature was far less common there. You don't find it in Australian or New Zealand accents, but you do find it in those North American accents more predominantly. Not always -- but as a general feature. You have this really nice time capsule just because the migrants came a couple of centuries earlier to the US than they did to Australia."
55,16,Gretchen,"It's a neat -- I mean, there are, obviously, historical records of when all this migration was happening, but it's comforting to know that if we didn't have those historical records, we would be able to reconstruct them from the accents."
55,17,Lauren,"Yeah. Or if we didn't have those records and, for some reason, the lack of R was also really common in North America, we have the written record in English to show us that there is an R at the end of words like 'car' that there isn't in some other words. As someone who doesn't have this feature, sometimes, if I'm trying to put on a North American accent, I over apply it to words where there isn't an R in writing as well. I recently tried to say the word, 'tuna,' the fish, with an American accent and over compensated and went with 'tunar,' which is absolutely not correct and also a terrible accent."
55,18,Gretchen,"Also, that's a piano tuner or something."
55,19,Lauren,"Oh, yeah, a 'tuner' that you tune a piano with -- it sounds exactly the same for me, but it's a completely different spelling and a completely different word."
55,20,Gretchen,"Well, and the interesting thing is, I do have Rs in my accent, but I'm also very accustomed to hearing non-rhotic accents because I think I've listened to more Australian English in the last, say, five years or so because, you know, we talk to each other quite a lot doing this podcast. I visited Australia. But even before that, I'd consume plenty of British media and stuff like that, which a lot of the British accents are non-rhotic, but some of them are still rhotic, especially in the North and in Scotland and so on. I consumed a lot of non-rhotic accents, so I'm using to hearing it. In many cases, if you're used to hearing those accents, you don't even necessarily notice it as, 'Oh, there aren't Rs here,' you notice it, 'This just sounds like it's from wherever.' But sometimes when I'm hearing a non-rhotic speaker, I over apply, and I insert, mentally, Rs in what they're trying to say even when they aren't trying to say an R because I'm so used to reconstructing that R in my head."
55,21,Lauren,Amazing. You just hallucinate sound is basically what's happening.
55,22,Gretchen,"Yeah! A non-rhotic friend of mine was recently talking about lava, like the thing that comes out from the earth in a volcano, but saying, 'There's a lot of lava here.' I misheard her as saying, 'larva.'"
55,23,Lauren,As in bug babies?
55,24,Gretchen,"Yes, as in bug babies, which is a very different mental image from molten rock."
55,25,Lauren,Especially if you think of them spewing out of the earth like a volcano. That's actually terrifying.
55,26,Gretchen,"It's kind of horrific. But yeah, sometimes it happens on both the production and the perception side. Sometimes you can hear an R that isn't there or hear a ghost of an R that wasn't there, or you can end up producing it when you weren't trying to."
55,27,Lauren,"I think it is really interesting that, obviously, I consume a lot of Australian media. You hear a lot of Canadian voices. The two big producers of culture for that anglosphere, English speakers, is that Southern England English and the North American English. One in England is traditionally marked with not having R at the end of words pronounced, and American English does have that R. It's very rhotic. We're exposed to both types very commonly, which is why I think it's hard to hear or remember that you're hearing it."
55,28,Gretchen,"I think it's interesting to think about this in terms of the prestige varieties in both of these places because there are American accents that are non-rhotic. In the American South, a lot of the accents don't have that R at the end of the syllable. There are British accents that are rhotic, especially in the north. The prestigious accent that you find on media and television, unless a character is being stereotyped as having an accent, the unmarked accent that you see on both of these is different with respect to that R. This was something that was one of those early revelations that I had as a budding linguist of like, hey, here's this R. In one country it's having the R that's prestigious and it's not having the R that's looked down on. Then in the other country, it's not having the R that's prestigious and it's having the R that's more stigmatised. Clearly, it's not R's fault here. R is just a consonant just trying to live its life."
55,29,Lauren,Just a hapless victim.
55,30,Gretchen,"A hapless victim of our human prejudices. There's not some sort of objective right or wrong answer of, 'Is R good or is R bad?' Other things that are associated with particular accents are also neutral variables, but some of them are widely disparaged all over and some of them are widely prestigious all over. This one is interesting, in the case of R, because it has this local difference on whether it's prestigious or not prestigious."
55,31,Lauren,It's made it a really attractive topic of study for linguists who are interested in the social values that we apply to different accents. One thing I find particularly interesting in the American context where this has been studied quite a lot is that it's not just a matter of whether you have a rhotic accent or not. There are lots of people who can produce the rhotic accent and do include that R at the end of words or might not depending on the social context and how fancy they want to sound. Which means that we get to talk about probably one of the most famous studies in English sociolinguistics.
55,32,Gretchen,"Yes. There is this very classic study by Bill Labov who is an American sociolinguist. He went to three different levels of department stores -- one that was very fancy, one that was mid-level, and one that was like a bargain basement store. You really get a feeling for the vintage department store vibe. He found the location of something -- I think the women's shoe section is what he says in the paper -- that was already on the fourth floor. He would find it on the map, and then he would go up to sales keepers and say, 'Hey, can you tell me where to find the women's shoes?', and they would say, 'fourth floor.' And he would say, 'Pardon me?'"
55,33,Lauren,"Or they would say, /fɑ:ð flɑː/."
55,34,Gretchen,"Yes, /fæːð flæ:/, in my bad imitation of a New York accent. He would say, 'Pardon me?', and then they would say it again, more distinctly. Then he would go around the corner, whip out his notebook, and write down whether or not they said the R in both the first one -- the natural one -- and then the careful-er, more enunciated one afterwards."
55,35,Lauren,"You could more or less map the fancier the department store, the more likely the salesperson was to use the rhotic R. If you asked someone to repeat something, it then becomes careful speech, where they're trying to be as articulate as possible, for whatever that means, and they're more likely to include an R in that context as well. You see all these factors really elegantly. I think this study is attractive because it's so elegant in how it was set up that people are more likely to use an R to sound fancy in New York in this context. It's been replicated over decades. People have moved more towards R, and it's become the concrete standard of pronunciation."
55,36,Gretchen,"Also, I think it's just such a fun mental image of some guy with a notebook wandering around from department store to department store. When we were doing Crash Course Linguistics, one of the thought bubbles, which are little animated bits, we actually suggested, and they took our suggestion, that they do a little animated Labov wandering from department store to department store. That's a really cute animation that you can now watch."
55,37,Lauren,It also means that the concept of the fourth floor has become a bit of a linguist in-joke. I am so pleased to say that my office at work is on the fourth floor.
55,38,Gretchen,"I went to a Linguistic Society of America conference a number of years ago in which all of the conference rooms at the hotel where on the fourth floor. You could just hear all the linguists taking delight in saying to each other, 'Which way to the conference?', 'Go to the FOURTH FLOOR.'"
55,39,Lauren,You could not have planned that better.
55,40,Gretchen,It's also a bit of a meme in linguistics that stuff happens on the fourth floor. It's a fairly salient thing about English accents that they do different things with Rs. There's also downstream effects of what happens when your accent only sometimes has this R.
55,41,Lauren,"Yes. Even though I say that I don't have an R at the end of words, if you were to actually monitor my speech very carefully and do all the fancy phonetician sound analysis things or even just use your ears, I have R popping up at the end of words all the time in the context known as 'linking' or 'obtrusive R,' which is where you get a word that should have an R at the end, and then you have another word that begins with a vowel."
55,42,Gretchen,"Because your Rs are only dropped when they're at the end of a syllable, when they're after a vowel, if there's another vowel following, they can become the host for that R, then you don't need to drop it anymore."
55,43,Lauren,"If I said something like, 'ca-r and /dɹɑɪvə/,' or 'pasta-r and sauce' -- it can even go in where there wouldn't be an R. I guess if I said something like, 'tuna-r and rice.'"
55,44,Gretchen,"There's a bit of an R there, whereas I have 'tuna and rice' and there's nothing R-like there because, for me, 'tuna' and 'tuner' -- 'tuner' and 'player' or something like that -- those are totally different."
55,45,Lauren,It's a way for my accent to mark the boundary between words in a way that works even though I can't say an R at the end of a word without trying very hard.
55,46,Gretchen,Very 'harrrrd.'
55,47,Lauren,"In English. I should say R at the end of words is a feature of Nepali, and I can do that fine. I don't think about it in Nepali, and I don't think about it in English, but I have to put an R there. I have to work so hard in English."
55,48,Gretchen,So 'harrrrd.'
55,49,Lauren,So 'harrrrd.'
55,50,Gretchen,"It's something that stands out more strongly if you're a non-rhotic speaker because, to me, I'm always paying attention to that R when it's after a vowel. Having it show up in 'pasta-r and sauce' or 'tuna-r and rice,' that's very salient to me as opposed to just being a thing you could stick between stuff. There's also, sometimes, this R or lack of R shows up in certain stereotyped pronunciations of things. I'm thinking, you know that song in The Sound of Music where you're learning the names of the notes -- do re mi fa so la ti do -- and they have this bit that's like, 'Fa -- a long, long way to run'?"
55,51,Lauren,"Yeah, because it's '/fɑ:/ -- a long, long way to run.' You're running /fɑ:/."
55,52,Gretchen,"No, you're running 'far.'"
55,53,Lauren,"Hang on, yeah, because 'far' in that song is F-A."
55,54,Gretchen,It's F-A.
55,55,Lauren,"I guess it's a homophone, but it's not a homograph. They're not written the same. It's a homophone for me but not for you."
55,56,Gretchen,"It's a homophone for, clearly, the writers of this song. As a child I was like, 'What word are they trying to get me to say?' Because something like 'ti -- a drink with jam and bread,' that's fine. I don't write those the same, but I still pronounce it /ti/."
55,57,Lauren,"Also, not spelled the same, yes."
55,58,Gretchen,"I still pronounce it '/ti/', we're okay with one that. But 'Fa -- a long, long way to run,' I had to stop and think and be like, 'What word are they trying to get at here?'"
55,59,Lauren,One of those classic scenarios of a bunch of supposed German speakers in German singing a song that only -- the whole song actually falls apart because they're English homophones --
55,60,Gretchen,"None of these are German words. They're in Austria. Why are they singing all these English rhymes? It's like you find the ancient inscription in the cave, and somehow you translate this poem into English, and it rhymes perfectly in English, and you're like, 'This was written in Sumerian. Like, what?'"
55,61,Lauren,This is why we're super fun to watch films with.
55,62,Gretchen,"It's like, 'How does this song work in English? They're speaking German!'"
55,63,Lauren,"This reminds me of another thing I have confounded you with in non-rhotic English, which is that because I don't pronounce the R, I can use A-R-G-H to represent an excited exclamation of like, 'AH!'"
55,64,Gretchen,"Oh, no."
55,65,Lauren,"I have, on occasion, used this at Gretchen as a form of messaging enthusiasm. Gretchen has seen it as like I am --"
55,66,Gretchen,"Like, 'ARGH I got ice cream!' It's like, 'Why are you upset about the ice cream? I thought ice cream was nice.'"
55,67,Lauren,"It turns out what we have completely different readings of this because, in my non-rhotic accent, it has way more of a general exclamatory-ness. What do you read 'Argh' or 'Arrr' as?"
55,68,Gretchen,"It's an expression of frustration for me. Like, 'Arrrgh, I don't wanna do this,' or 'Arrrgh, I got a flat tire,' or something. Not 'Arrrgh, I got free ice cream.'"
55,69,Lauren,I can use it in a much more broad range of contexts. Maybe this is just me. Maybe this is some idiosyncratic usage.
55,70,Gretchen,"But like, A-H, 'Ah!' I have a broader range of contexts for, but it is very distinct from 'Argh.'"
55,71,Lauren,"I would have to say something like, 'AH, I got ice cream,' A-H?"
55,72,Gretchen,Yeah. This is fine.
55,73,Lauren,Okay.
55,74,Gretchen,"I had this experience when I was reading, especially, British children's fiction or British YA. The characters would say things like, 'erm' and 'er.' I was like, okay, fine, 'Er, I don't know where this is' or 'Erm, I don't know the answer.' I was like, 'That's just what they say in British. Sure. That's fine.' How would you pronounce 'erm' and 'er'?"
55,75,Lauren,"They say /ə/ and /ə:m/. 'Erm, let me think about that I, er, don't know.' I do know. Exactly like that."
55,76,Gretchen,"I didn't realise until much, much later that this was just a rhotic description of the pronunciation that I would write 'um' and 'uh' -- U-M and U-H."
55,77,Lauren,I guess this is one context where audiobooks read by someone who has the same general rhoticity as the original author would be very handy.
55,78,Gretchen,"Yeah. Because I think, among me and at least some other nerds of my generation, sometimes I do write, 'er,' when I'm in text because, to me, it has a slightly different meaning from 'uh' because I encountered it in text."
55,79,Lauren,Amazing.
55,80,Gretchen,But the best one of you read something and it's written for an accent that's not your accent is -- you know the donkey character in Winne the Pooh?
55,81,Lauren,Eeyore?
55,82,Gretchen,"Yeah. As I would say, /ijoɹ/, because there's an R in the writing there. I didn't learn until I was well into my 20s that, of course, A. A. Milne was a non-rhotic speaker, and he would've pronounced that donkey /iɑ:/, like the sound a donkey makes."
55,83,Lauren,Mm-hmm.
55,84,Gretchen,"This is a massive revelation for me, and you're just like, 'Yeah, I've known this my entire life.'"
55,85,Lauren,"Uh, yes, because donkeys have a non-rhotic accent. I thought that was obvious to everyone."
55,86,Gretchen,"[Laughs] Donkeys don't have Rs. A lot of these particular Rs that we're talking about are specifically the R at the end of a syllable or the, what linguists call, 'R-coloured vowels.' It's a vowel and it's an R smooshed together. This is how I would say the name of the letter R -- it's not /a: ɹ/ -- it's all one /aɹ/, all one thing. Or /ɹ̩/ like in 'tuner' or 'player' or 'maker' or any of these words that end in /ɹ̩/."
55,87,Lauren,"If you were writing it down in a specific phonetic notation, you wouldn't have a vowel and then a distinct R there together."
55,88,Gretchen,"Yeah. Sometimes, there's a bit of gradience in terms of how you do that. If you think of something like, say I'm saying a single syllable that ends in an unambiguous consonant like /æt/, I have two different things going on in my mouth at the same time. I have the /a/ part and then immediately after that I have my mouth closing to make the T. But for R, or /ɹ̩/, my mouth is staying in the same position. I can just make the /ɹ̩/ -- I can make the vowel and the R-ness of it at the same time without having to change my tongue position or anything about my mouth position. That's what it means when a vowel can have R features on it at the same time or be R-coloured."
55,89,Lauren,That's why we also hedge by talking about 'R-like sounds' because it's not that this is separately and by itself the sound /aɹ/ but that it has this influence over the vowel.
55,90,Gretchen,"It's got this influence over the vowel, especially when it's written as coming after it. If you have something like 'raw' or 'ray,' 're-,' you do have 'ra-'-- you do have a movement from the R at the beginning to afterwards. That's why it's so easy to drop that R after a vowel because it's already just a slightly different position for how you're holding that vowel. R-coloured vowels are a thing that everyone taking intro English linguistics learns about because it's a thing that we have in English -- and I haven't learned any other languages that have them. But you never know what that means about your language typology."
55,91,Lauren,Whether this is some super common phenomenon and you just happen to have not learnt a language with it or whether it's just a weird North American thing.
55,92,Gretchen,"Yeah, not even all of English. It turns out that R-coloured vowels are both very rare and very common depending on how you measure commonness."
55,93,Lauren,"That's because they also turn up in a couple of the more dominant varieties of Mandarin. This is one of those things that it was really nice to be able to put a name to, but I realised that I had been using this R-coloured-ness to help myself distinguish between whether I was likely overhearing Mandarin or spoken Cantonese because this R-colouring is really common -- especially in really major dialects like Beijing and other Northern Chinese varieties of spoken Mandarin."
55,94,Gretchen,"On the one hand, R-coloured vowels occur in less than 1% of the languages of the world, at least as we're currently able to measure them."
55,95,Lauren,In terms of the speakers.
55,96,Gretchen,"But they occur in two of the most widely spoken languages -- right. North American English or certain varieties of English and certain varieties of Chinese, both of which have millions and millions of speakers."
55,97,Lauren,And are really common as the prestige types in media as well.
55,98,Gretchen,"And are a really common second language. There are also R-coloured vowels in Quebec French where you have /ɹ̩/ a bit more -- now that I'm thinking about it -- is more a feature of Quebec French than in France French, and in some varieties of Brazilian Portuguese and, you know, a few other languages, a few Indigenous languages like Yurok in the US. There is a whole name for this phenomenon in Chinese because it's common in Mandarin. It's called, 'érhuàyīn' [simplified Chinese: 儿化音; traditional Chinese: 兒化音]. It works differently to how rhotacisation works in English because it's obligatory in certain contexts in English, whereas the way that it happens in Mandarin is -- like other things, I don't speak this, so I'm not exactly sure what the details are -- but apparently, it's used by speakers to notice people from different varieties."
55,99,Lauren,"It's so interesting that it was a feature I had been attracted to in Mandarin, and you had noticed without particularly noticing in Quebec French until we put together this episode and realised we were attending to the same phenomenon of R-colouring."
55,100,Gretchen,"This gets us into this broader class of R-like sounds. Linguists talk about 'rhotics,' but if you learned languages beyond English, really any language other than English, you've probably learned a different way to produce those particular R sounds because like, 'Oh, this language has yet a different R.' It's one of those interestingly nebulous bits of linguistics that people seem to share this very strong intuition that some sounds are R-like. And yet, when you're trying to actually put your finger on, 'Well, what makes them R-like?', it becomes a way more complicated question."
55,101,Lauren,"I guess one of the ones that is most immediately noticeable because it's quite a fancy R is the /r/ in -- I learnt to pronounce trilled R when I was learning Polish in a word like 'pierogi.' It's not as strong, but I could really emphasise it and talk about /piroʊgi/, which is definitely not how I would normally say that word, but you can hear that trilling of the R sound."
55,102,Gretchen,"I encountered this R when I was trying to learn Spanish in high school. I got okay at Spanish, but I had a really hard time with this R. Because Spanish has two Rs. It has the tap R like in /pɛɾo/, meaning 'but,' and then there's this trilled R like in the word for 'dog,' which is /pɛro/ -- /pɛro/? Which I'm still not very good at. I can kind of make it now because there was a really helpful YouTube video that I watched a couple years ago after way too many years of trying and failing to produce this trilled R with the tip of your tongue. It turned out the thing about the trilled R is that you have to get a part of your mouth vibrating at such a fast speed that you don't have conscious control over it. The way that you do that is you direct air in your mouth towards a place that's just a little bit in front of where you actually want the vibration to happen. It's like blowing into an instrument with a reed in it or blowing into a blade of grass between your fingers. You can direct that air and make this wavy -- I think it's the Bernoulli Reaction -- happen in your mouth. That's what's making this sound that's too fast for you to do it consciously. The mistake that I had been making was to direct the air actually at the tip of my tongue rather than directing it a little bit before so that the tongue can wave in the breeze like a little flag. I'm still not 100% on it, but I can sometimes do that [trilling sound] sometimes."
55,103,Lauren,"It's interesting that the R sound that the trill contrasts with is just a single tap. Instead of a repeated tapping motion, it's just that single /pɛɾo/. One thing that is difficult about these R-like sounds that we're talking about is that that's more like something that we sometimes use for a D in English or a T in a word like /bʌɾə/ if we're just saying it very rapidly. It is an R-thing in Spanish, but it's not necessarily an R thing in English."
55,104,Gretchen,"That's what makes the category of rhotics or R-like sounds such a bizarre thing because basically it's an R if people think it's an R. There's a lot of agreement within speakers about like, 'Oh, yeah, this feels like an R to me, and this doesn't feel like an R.' I really had to convince myself that the sound in 'water' or 'butter' or something was actually the same as in /pɛɾo/ because I was like, 'But those feel like different sounds to me even though I can produce them both,' and I guess my tongue is doing the same thing. But one of them feels like an R."
55,105,Lauren,"Whereas for the trill, you can replace an English R. You could say, 'Let's talk about /roʊtɪsɪti/' and that fits in as an R. [Gretchen laughs] I'm sorry to --"
55,106,Gretchen,That's great. No. Please. Let's talk about -- I'm just jealous that I can't make it.
55,107,Lauren,"Sorry to show off there. But you can see that in English, at least, that trilled R can substitute in for our usual R."
55,108,Gretchen,"It sounds fancy, but it still sounds like an R. If I encounter a language, and I'm like, 'Oh, it's got this alveolar trilled R with the tip of the tongue,' I'm like, 'Oh, yeah, totally normal R. Nothing to see here. Nothing surprising.' It's found in Italian. It's found in Spanish, Russian, Ukrainian, Dutch, Bulgarian, Swedish. There's a whole bunch of languages that have this trilled R with the tip of the tongue. There are also a lot of languages that have the tap, which is just the single tap. Again, Spanish also has it. Japanese and Korean both have it. This is quite common in a lot of languages as well."
55,109,Lauren,"I can do that trill at the alveolar, but I do struggle with the one that happens further back in the mouth that you find in French."
55,110,Gretchen,"Oh, yay! That's the one I can do."
55,111,Lauren,"It's in French and German and languages like modern Hebrew as well. Again, one of this category of R-like sounds but a bit further back."
55,112,Gretchen,"/ʀ/ /ʀ/. This is the one that uses the little dangly bit at the back of your throat that you can see if you look in a mirror and scream. I think of it as a sort of cartoon screaming thing. If you can get that one waving in the back of your throat, /ʀ/ -- I'm good at this one. My theory is that people are either good at this --"
55,113,Lauren,You get one.
55,114,Gretchen,"-- the throat one or the tip of the tongue one and that very few people are good at both of them. Many people can do one or the other and are very frustrated they can't do the other one. There are a variety of things that are done with the back of the throat that are often lumped together. In French you can have like, 'roi,' the word for 'king,' or 'rue,' the word for 'street,' and you can either /ʁ/ or /χ/. You can make it either with the vocal cords vibrating or not vibrating. You can pretty much do whichever one you want. Something that's interesting about French is that French actually underwent a shift from the tip of the tongue one, which is still produced by a few, I think it's mostly old men in rural Quebec, who still produce the one that you have in Polish. They still produce that R."
55,115,Lauren,"Again, migration working as an amazing time capsule creation device."
55,116,Gretchen,"Most of French speakers, including most people in Quebec -- like younger people -- but occasionally you'll get some especially old men in less geographically central areas who still have that one because this has happened over the last 100 years that French has switched what kind of R it has. That's one of the reasons why you can say, 'Well, what do these two sounds have in common?' Okay. They're both produced as a trill with that very fast vibration but so is the trill with the lips, /B/. Basically no languages consider the lip trill to be an R. That one's not an R. /B/. I don't know of any languages that consider that one to be an R-like sound. The other two that are midway in the mouth and back in the throat, those are R-like, and yet not this other one. The reason why it makes sense to consider all of these sounds together in the 'R-like' category is because sometimes languages really do hop from one to the other because they still feel R-like somehow even though we don't have a good way to pin down exactly what it is physically that you're doing that makes it R-like."
55,117,Lauren,You can tell the sounds that linguists think fit into this category because the International Phonetic Alphabet character for them tends to be some variation on our character for the letter R.
55,118,Gretchen,It's like shameless pandering to the R lobby.
55,119,Lauren,"It's really one of the cruellest things we do to people trying to learn to memorise all the symbols on the IPA because you have what we think of as a common R in English for words like 'red,' or 'rhotic,' is the letter R upside-down. Those uvular ones that you were talking about -- is it a capital R upside down? The trill at the alveolar that we were talking about is the standard letter R. They're all just little variations on it."
55,120,Gretchen,"One of the things, speaking of Rs that vary, that I learned when we were researching this is that in Northern England there were once accents that used this /ʁ/, the back of the throat R like French has, which was described as a 'burr.'"
55,121,Lauren,That's what people are trying to get at with that description of Northern accents.
55,122,Gretchen,"Yeah. Because I've read -- I dunno if it was Jane Austin specifically -- but that era of English writer where they would say, 'Oh, and this character had a 'burr' in his voice,' and I was just like, 'A little fuzzy Velcro-y creature that sticks to you? What are you talking about this?' It's actually trying to describe this /ʁ/ R that people had."
55,123,Lauren,"Again, a nice example of the incredible variety of rhotic things that people have done with English."
55,124,Gretchen,"What's interesting is this R, too, is not always an R in every language because Arabic has a bog standard, tip of the tongue R like is common in very many languages. I actually had to go look up like, 'What kind of R does Arabic have, again?' Because I studied it for a few years, and I'd forgotten what kind of R they have. And, oh, they have the normal one. Okay. Arabic also has a sound that's very similar to what, in French, is the R sound at the back of the throat. It's not treated as an R for the purposes of the rest of Arabic. It's written with a G-H when you're transcribing Arabic, and it's produced in a very similar manner as what French considers an R, but it's not an R language-internally, based on what people think of as R-like -- in a similar way as this D in 'water.'"
55,125,Lauren,"There's this very loose set of what linguists broadly think of as potentially R-like, and then that manifests differently depending on the language and the other sounds that it's in contrast to."
55,126,Gretchen,"Exactly. Maybe the best example of this is that -- because there's a certain kind of sound that in some contexts can be an R-like sound, but most of the time in English, is more like a W."
55,127,Lauren,Right. Is that the very fancy Received Pronunciation English accent of talking about 'woticity'?
55,128,Gretchen,''Mawwidge' is what 'bwrings' us here together today.'
55,129,Lauren,"It's also a not-uncommon phase for children to go through. I think it's worth saying, if you have any anxiety about not being able to produce one of the trills or one of the other R-type sounds that we've talked about today, it's very common to not be able to hit sounds that aren't in your languages that you've grown up with."
55,130,Gretchen,R is one of those hard sounds even for English-speaking children who've been exposed to it from birth.
55,131,Lauren,"Children go through developmental stages where it takes them a while to get the hang of it. A lot of the time they'll outgrow it. It's worth just keeping an eye on and enjoying while it briefly occurs. If it's persistent and your child is getting into 3 and 4 and it's really not moving at all, that can be a time to maybe chat to a speech pathologist. But it is a completely normal phase to go through. It's also completely normal not to be able to acquire sounds that aren't in the languages that you are exposed to and that you speak. Don't be too hard on yourself if you can't hit one of those trills."
55,132,Gretchen,"I have lost track of the number of small children, like extended family and friends' kids, who have called me 'Gwetchen' for six months."
55,133,Lauren,"Oh my gosh, too cute."
55,134,Gretchen,"'Gwetchen!' It's great. It's really wonderful. It's so cute. There's the classic Looney Tunes, 'wascaly wabbit.' This is clearly also a stereotyped feature of a certain kind of childish speech in English. In addition to this T and G-H and W, sometimes, have ties with R, another really interesting sound that has ties with R is the /z/ sound, which is often written with S but actually pronounced /z/ as in 'Zed.' In both the history of English and the history of Latin and the history of other languages, sometimes you get a /z/ changing to an R. This is how we get words like 'was' and 'were.'"
55,135,Lauren,Ah. It's one of those things that's been staring me right in the face.
55,136,Gretchen,"Yeah. 'Was' and 'were,' 'is' and 'are,' 'rise' and 'rear,' as in 'to bring up.'"
55,137,Lauren,"Ah, yes."
55,138,Gretchen,"And the suffixes '-er' and '-est' as in 'bigger,' 'biggest,' is another pair. Or words like 'more' and 'most,' 'better' and 'best,' 'loss' and 'forlorn.'"
55,139,Lauren,"Oh my gosh, this is a lot of very core English that I'm re-thinking for the first time."
55,140,Gretchen,"Right? Sometimes an S or a Z just becomes an R or vice versa. Especially, the R often shows up between two vowels. The S changes to a /z/ sound between two vowels, and then that /z/ can change to an R because if you're producing your R with the tongue near the front of the mouth, that's kind of also where you're pronouncing a /z/ sound. They're not quite as different as you might think they are -- at least if you're producing that particular R. There's also examples of this in Latin. You have things like 'genus' -- or /d͡ʒinəs/ -- and 'generous.'"
55,141,Lauren,"Which gives us 'genre,'"
55,142,Gretchen,"'Genre,' and 'generic,' and a whole bunch of words like that. And 'genus,' like 'species.' This happens in a bunch of languages. It's not just those two. But you can see it in English and be like, 'Wait! This has been here all along.'"
55,143,Lauren,"It's another really great example of how rhoticity and rhotic sounds have this incredible flexibility and ability to change over time that makes them such an interesting little feature to pull apart and look at across a single language, across history, or across lots of different languages. You can start off going, 'Okay, we're going to look at R-like things,' and you can dig down and dig down and build more of an appreciation. You dig down so far you come back to they're all just kind of R-like things."
55,144,Gretchen,"You know how in nature the shape of a crab -- the sideways scuttling, pinch-y arm thing -- has evolved in several completely different branches of the family tree?"
55,145,Lauren,Yes.
55,146,Gretchen,They call this 'cancericization' -- 'everything wants to become a crab.' That's 'cancer' as in the Zodiac sign not 'cancer' as in the disease. I think there's also maybe -- rhotacisation is like cancericization. Everything wants to become a crab; everything wants to become an R. R just shows up and has its little pinching fingers in so many different places.
55,147,Lauren,"It's never quite the same thing. Whenever you come across something written as an R in a language, it's always good to keep an open mind about exactly what that is an exactly how it's used. It's a little recurring motif."
55,148,Gretchen,"You keep coming back to this sense of similarity that people have noticed over and over again, even though these sounds are produced in incredibly different ways. [Music]"

56,1,Gretchen,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics! I'm Gretchen McCulloch."
56,2,Lauren,I'm Lauren Gawne. Today we're getting enthusiastic about negation!
56,3,Gretchen,"Or 'We're not getting unenthusiastic about negation,' if you will."
56,4,Lauren,"'We're not NOT getting enthusiastic about negation.' But first, we just want to say thanks to everyone who became a patron or was already a patron and came to our April liveshow that was part of LingFest."

56,7,Gretchen,'There is nothing to be suspicious about here.'
56,8,Lauren,'That's good because I absolutely did not eat the whole secret stash of chocolate while you weren't looking.'
56,9,Gretchen,'And I definitely didn't spill water everywhere.'
56,10,Lauren,'I totally have not adopted a pet dinosaur.'
56,11,Gretchen,'The moon is absolutely in its usual position. No one has blown it up -- especially not me.'
56,12,Lauren,"I am quite dubious, and I'm just gonna wait until I can definitely check that by looking at the moon."
56,13,Gretchen,I am also a little bit worried about the status of your dinosaur or dinosaur-free lifestyle.
56,14,Lauren,I don't have a pet dinosaur. I was very clear. No dinosaur.
56,15,Gretchen,"But if you haven't had a pet dinosaur the entire time I've known you, why are you bringing it up today?"
56,16,Lauren,"Every day I have not had a pet dinosaur, and yet, bringing it up today somehow makes it feel relevant in a way a bit like we talked about in our episode on Gricean maxims where you only talk about things because they are relevant."
56,17,Gretchen,Just like I have not been blowing up the moon every single day of my life --
56,18,Lauren,Thankfully.
56,19,Gretchen,"-- yet somehow, when I start saying it like that, it also reminds me of a feature of the podcast Welcome to Night Vale, which is a delightfully surreal podcast. There's this bit in Episode 8 that I wrote about back in 2013 when I was first listening to Welcome to Night Vale that also uses negation in a very similar sort of way. Here's the quote, 'We're receiving word from the City Council that there was absolutely not a Pink Floyd Multimedia Laser Spectacular this weekend at Radon Canyon -- there never was a Pink Floyd Multimedia Laser Spectacular ever near Night Vale. 'Pink Floyd is not even a thing,' said the Council in a statement,' and at the same time, you're left with this impression that --"
56,20,Lauren,That's a lot of denying.
56,21,Gretchen,"Yeah. It's sort of 'Methinks thou dost protest too much,' like, 'Why are you protesting so much?' Surely, every day, near my house, there is not a Pink Floyd Multimedia Laser Spectacular, and yet no one has felt obliged to inform me of this."
56,22,Lauren,It's because the only times we talk about something not happening is because the absence of something is relevant. Language takes a default positive talking about things that are here or do exist. It's the lack of something that gets overtly marked in the grammar of languages.
56,23,Gretchen,"Right. It's also the lack of something brings in this presupposition that the lack of something is a relevant thing to talk about or that it could have been expected but hasn't happened. If I say something like, 'I haven't eaten dinner yet today,' that's not ontologically weird, philosophically weird, in the same way 'I don't have a pet dinosaur' is weird. Because it is still an open question on any given day whether or not I've had dinner. Or if I say, 'I don't have a cat,' that is an open question that reasonable people sometimes do have cats, and so it could be reasonably relevant that I might or might not have a cat in the way that it's not reasonably relevant that I might or might not have a pet dinosaur."
56,24,Lauren,"This shows up in the grammar where the default is positive. You don't add anything to a sentence, usually, to indicate that something's positive. You have to add something to the grammar to show that it's negative."
56,25,Gretchen,"If you look at the World Atlas of Linguistic Structures, which is a great set of maps that is available on the internet for free for you to look at, they have over 1,000 languages on their negation map. They have a bunch of different ways that languages can indicate negation, whether you add a different word or whether you change something about the verb or whether you add two things or other things like that. In over 1,000 languages, all of them have something you add to make the sentence negative -- not, for example, something you take away."
56,26,Lauren,You get to this point with language as a consistent feature of language where the absence of something or the negation of something is indicated by adding something to the grammar whether that's a word or a morpheme that affixes to a word.
56,27,Gretchen,"Which is philosophically weird when you think about it, right, because why is the presence of something indicated with the version of the sentence that has less in it, and the absence of something is indicated by the version of the sentence that has more in it."
56,28,Lauren,"I think it definitely goes back to the initial examples we used where actually talking about the absence of something only happens when absence is relevant because there is not a dinosaur in my house every day, but I absolutely don't need to point out every day all the things that are not in my house."
56,29,Gretchen,You don't have any zebras either?
56,30,Lauren,I just start the day by rattling them off.
56,31,Gretchen,Listing every single animal that's not in my house every day before I do anything else.
56,32,Lauren,We tend to only talk about the absence of something when it's relevant. This is part of why negation is an additive thing to the grammar. We think about the positive version of the utterance as somehow being more default.
56,33,Gretchen,"It's actually kind of similar to how we think about numbers. Like, 'one' and 'two' and 'three' were invented a long time before the number 'zero' was invented. Even though before you have one of something, you have zero of it, but it wasn't being commented on in a numerical way. It might've been being commented on in a negative way because languages do have negation, but it wasn't being commented on as 'I have zero dinosaurs.'"
56,34,Lauren,"Why negation is something that's kept mathematicians and philosophers and people doing logic and linguists entertained, and many other people entertained, for such a long time and why we're giving it its own whole episode."
56,35,Gretchen,'We're not NOT doing a negation episode.'
56,36,Lauren,"Alongside the strong consistency of having some kind of additional marking to indicate negation, the use of particular gestures to indicate negation seems to be one of the more consistent things that languages do across families."
56,37,Gretchen,I love it when you have a gesture tie-in.
56,38,Lauren,"For a couple of centuries, people have grappled with the fact that shaking the head to indicate 'no' is incredibly prevalent across languages -- and way more prevalent and consistent than nodding is to indicate 'yes.'"
56,39,Gretchen,Oh! That's interesting.
56,40,Lauren,The generally agreed-upon theory is that shaking your head to indicate 'no' starts really early when infants are refusing food because it's something you have an imperative to do.
56,41,Gretchen,"'No, don't want this food. No!'"
56,42,Lauren,"Even Charles Darwin wrote a book that, I think, it was just gonna be a chapter of On the Origin of Species, and he just got way into it looking at gestures looking across humans and other animals and different languages and was like, 'The head shake for 'no' is really consistent.' How people indicate 'yes' is less consistent, and it just seems to be 'do something that isn't 'no',' whereas 'no' seems to be the starting point."
56,43,Gretchen,Hmm. That's interesting.
56,44,Lauren,"You have this really consistent pattern with head shaking, and you also have these families of gestural tendencies across languages where people use some kind of away motion for negation with their hands."
56,45,Gretchen,"Like, 'Oh, no, I can't.' I'm doing some sort of sweeping away from my shoulders."
56,46,Lauren,"A pushing away or a sweeping away or a throwing away are all part of this family that have been looked at across languages. I've just published a paper in a journal, Semiotica, about this flicking away, rolling away, gesture that you get in Syuba narratives when people are talking about the absence or the lack of something in a story. All of these types of away negation seem to also tap into this human conceptualisation of negation as something pushed away from or held away from the body -- 'away' and negation seems to fit together in our --"
56,47,Gretchen,"'It's not near me.' That actually ties into this idea that the affirmative, the positive, the non-negative form is the default because if you're pushing it away from your body that implies that it was near your body in the first place."
56,48,Lauren,"We have a very bodily lived experience of existing and things being here or not being here. Although, that is a good point. I've been just talking about the positive, but there is a technical linguist term for 'not negative' which is 'affirmative' -- probably should mention that."
56,49,Gretchen,"I feel like people have encountered 'affirmative' in a very robot voice, you know, [imitates computer voice] 'Affirmative. Destroy all the humans' -- or something like that."
56,50,Lauren,"It's one of those times where you're like, 'Oh, good. A technical term that's already part of my vocabulary.' That's a win."
56,51,Gretchen,"It's interesting because you could imagine a language where the default beginning is actually negative and, instead, you add something to make it affirmative."
56,52,Lauren,This is a hard-to-wrap-your-head-around constructed language experiment.
56,53,Gretchen,"None of the languages in WALS do this, apparently, but you have English, which has 'I don't have a pet dino,' which is the negative, and 'I have a pet dino,' which is the affirmative. English Prime, which is what linguists do when they're trying to make up a language that is very similar to English but different except one thing so we don't have to make up new words the whole way through, where you could say something like, 'I have a pet dino,' meaning 'I don't have one' because that's the default form of the sentence, and then if you have like, 'I AFF have a pet dino,' which means 'I do have one,' where the 'AFF' is a fake word that means 'affirmative.' That's just not a thing you see grammatically."
56,54,Lauren,"I have learnt many languages, I have encountered complex grammars of many languages, and this actually hurts my brain to conceptualise as a way of speaking. In English we have a variety of ways of expressing negation in the grammar. We have separate words like 'no' or 'not' that we can use to make a whole sentence negative, or we also have affixes that we can use to make a particular word negative. 'Unenthusiastic' would be an example from the top of the show -- or 'unhappy,' 'unexciting,' 'uninteresting,' 'hopeless.' There're a variety of strategies that English has to do negating; it's not just one particular thing."
56,55,Gretchen,"The word formation side of negation often brings up the question of the fossilised words that English has in its vocabulary that look like they have a negative part to them, but we don't have the positive version of them anymore. You have things like, 'ruthless' or 'feckless' or 'unkempt,' but we don't have like, 'ruthful' or 'feckful' or 'kempt.'"
56,56,Lauren,'Kempt.' Yes.
56,57,Gretchen,There's a great poem about this which we can link to. What's interesting is that I've actually been -- this is a shameless bragging moment here -- I was reading an advance copy of Arika Okrent's upcoming book.
56,58,Lauren,I will be jealous of this on behalf of everyone because Arika Okrent wrote an amazing book about conlanging called In the Land of Invented Languages probably a decade ago now and has a new book about English grammar and its wonderful weirdnesses coming out in the middle of 2021.
56,59,Gretchen,"Her book is called Highly Irregular. It's coming out on July 1st, 2021. She makes this really interesting point in the advance copy which is, 'We joke about the missing flipsides of 'hapless,' 'ruthless,' and 'feckless,' but not what we should be able to form but don't from 'bashful,' 'grateful,' and 'wistful.''"
56,60,Lauren,"Huh! I feel like this is a reaction I have when I read Arika's work a lot. I'm just like, 'Ah, yeah. I hadn't thought about that before."
56,61,Gretchen,"There's no 'bashless,' 'grateless,' or 'wistless,' even though it feels natural that there should be a missing positive form of forms that have a negative. We don't have the same reaction of the missing negative form of things that have a positive, which also gets into that positive-as-default form."
56,62,Lauren,"These things always seem so consistent on the surface. Then you look at how people actually use them and what gets actively used and what becomes fossils, and you realise that applying negation is a little more complicated."
56,63,Gretchen,"Then on the flipside of affirmative is no negation at all. There's also this thing of like, 'What if you have extra negation? What if you wanna make something even more emphatically negated?' 'I absolutely did not get a baby dinosaur. Nope. No siree. Nah-uh. Didn't happen.'"
56,64,Lauren,"Some languages can put in more than one negating word to really emphasise that something is negated, which is a strategy you might be familiar with as 'double negation,' which occurs in about 10% of the world's languages."
56,65,Gretchen,"This is the strategy that I'm really familiar with in French because that's the default way of doing negation. In formal, written French you have at least two negative words. Sometimes, you can put in more. The default way of doing that is a 'ne' before the verb and a 'pas' after the verb. Sometimes the 'pas' can change into something else. So, 'ne VERB pas' is 'not,' but if you have 'ne VERB personne,' that's 'no one,' or 'ne VERB rien,' that's 'nothing.' Even if I just want to say, like, 'I did not receive a baby dinosaur,' it would be, 'Je n'ai pas reçu un dinosaure,' which is 'dinosaur' in French, in case that wasn't clear. You have the 'ne' and the 'pas' there. Although, in spoken French, a lot of times the 'ne' gets dropped, and so you just have the 'pas' indicating negation."
56,66,Lauren,"The 'ne' is the older part, right?"
56,67,Gretchen,"Yeah. English actually, historically, had a second negative particle that was before the verb. If you have 'I cannot,' it was more something like, 'I ne cannot.' They were both there and then the earlier one gets dropped. This happens sometimes you get negatives reinforcing each other and then 'Oh, now we don't need this one.'"
56,68,Lauren,"If we revisited those 120 languages with double negation in the WALS map in a century -- because languages are constantly changing and moving around in their grammar some of them might've dropped one of those negative elements and gone back to being a single negation language, and some languages might add a second one and become a language that has double negation. French is kind of in the middle of doing that at the moment."
56,69,Gretchen,"This process in linguistic research is called 'negative concord' rather than 'double negation' because it's not just two of them necessarily. A language that has negative concord can continue stacking negative elements like 'nothing' and 'no one' and all of these on top. Like, 'I didn't give nothing to no one,' that's totally the expected way of saying it in French."
56,70,Lauren,"It's interesting that that gloss works as the expected form in French because it is totally grammatically viable for some dialects of English, but it's often stigmatised as being not acceptable or not part of standard English."
56,71,Gretchen,"The thing that drives me up the wall about the logic for doing that is that the logic for stigmatising it is quote-unquote 'two negatives form a positive,' but what this logic doesn't realise is that it's extremely spurious logic. It's a misuse of how logic works."
56,72,Lauren,"Do you wanna unpack that for us? Because I personally find joy in the fact that language is more interesting than logic, but if people have encountered this argument, where does it fall down for you?"
56,73,Gretchen,"First of all, languages like French exist."
56,74,Lauren,I do wonder how much more milage double negation or negative concord in English would get if we called it the 'French negation.'
56,75,Gretchen,"Right! 'Oh, it's like French toast!' Everyone likes things that are French. The 'French toast' negation style. There were plenty of early logicians who were French who were surely not making this argument that doesn't even work for their language in the only way that they were doing things in Descartes's time."
56,76,Lauren,Language is not just numbers.
56,77,Gretchen,"Also, in English, nobody is confused about the difference between 'I didn't give nothing to nobody' and 'I'm not NOT excited.' Those both use multiple negations. In one of them, the negation is trying cancel out the negation, and in the other one, it's reinforcing the negation. We do know what people mean. It's not actually confusing."
56,78,Lauren,"In fact, we can throw even more negation into the way that we speak, and people cope with it really fine."
56,79,Gretchen,"The other thing is, is that -- I don't wanna get completely linguist on the logicians, but languages have been around for a lot longer than logic has."
56,80,Lauren,True.
56,81,Gretchen,"Formal logic has existed for, I dunno, what, Aristotle? So, a couple thousand years, if we're gonna be generous. Language has been around for somewhere in the tens of thousands of years. We're not even sure whether it's tens or hundreds of thousands because we literally don't have records. Just several orders of magnitude longer than logic has existed, language has been around. If we think that roughly 10% of languages have negative concord now, probably some fraction of languages have always had negative concord because it's a thing that people could do. It's a bit rich for logic, this young interloper, to come into language, which has been doing just fine this entire time, and be like, 'Sorry, you need to redo your entire system because I don't like it.' Who are you? It's so young."
56,82,Lauren,"With that in mind, should we try squeezing even more negation into a sentence? Because we can do better than just double negatives for negative concord."
56,83,Gretchen,Yes. This is where we can do one of my favourite examples which is the Mean Girls approach to negation.
56,84,Lauren,"Okay, not what I expected to be your favourite example, but let's go."
56,85,Gretchen,"I mean, look, any excuse to have a Mean Girls reference. That's the 'She doesn't even go here' type of negation. When you have several bits in a sentence that are actually negative, you could still take one out, and that's what makes the logical argument superficially appealing because you could get rid of someone, they're just reinforcing each other. But in this case, you have 'She doesn't even go here,' and if you try to make that positive -- 'She does even go here.'"
56,86,Lauren,'She even goes here.' I'm taking out the 'n't' -- 'She does even go here.' It doesn't work for me.
56,87,Gretchen,"Or you could do it with a different stress like, 'She EVEN goes here.'"
56,88,Lauren,Or I guess the affirmative form of this would just be 'She goes here.' The 'even' doesn't turn up at all.
56,89,Gretchen,The 'even' there is doing something interesting. It's reinforcing the negation without itself being negative per se in isolation -- just sort of not being around at all -- without the negative there to help it.
56,90,Lauren,"I guess it would be like a sentence like, 'I don't like ice cream at all,' which apart from being a fake fact --"
56,91,Gretchen,"[Laughs] Would you say, 'I like ice cream at all'?"
56,92,Lauren,"I would just say, 'I like ice cream.' The 'at all' doesn't need to be there at all."
56,93,Gretchen,"Or the 'I didn't eat a crumb of cake,' which you can say, 'I ate a crumb of cake,' but it's not quite the opposite of 'I didn't eat a crumb of cake.'"
56,94,Lauren,It's a little bit too literal in the affirmative version.
56,95,Gretchen,"Or something like, 'I didn't touch a drop of water.'"
56,96,Lauren,"'I touched a drop of water,' I just boop it with my ear."
56,97,Gretchen,Just going through the rain booping rain drops.
56,98,Lauren,That one absolutely does not work when you keep 'a drop of water' in there. That construction only works for me in the negative even though a lot of the words in it that are adding to the negation aren't necessarily negative in their structure.
56,99,Gretchen,"Exactly. It's saying, 'I didn't touch even the smallest amount of water' is what that's doing there. And there's that 'even' again. Coincidentally, this is also something that Arika Okrent talks about in her book Highly Irregular, which is coming out. It's not only a book about negation, I promise. I was just thinking about negation because I knew we were doing this episode when I was reading it."
56,100,Lauren,"Also, as you can tell from the examples, negation is where grammar starts to get particularly interesting, so it's unsurprisingly that a book like Highly Irregular would have a couple of stories about negation in it."
56,101,Gretchen,"Yeah, because there're interesting things to say there. Arika Okrent has this great section which talks about things like 'even' and 'any' and 'at all' and 'a drop of' which are called 'negative polarity items,' if you want a technical term for it."
56,102,Lauren,This is a technical term that I know but hadn't really thought about until we started putting the show together. I guess that by 'items' they just mean things that are words or multiple words because 'a crumb of' isn't a word. We can't just call them 'negative polarity words.'
56,103,Gretchen,"Some of them are individual words like 'any' or 'yet' or 'even' or 'either.' Some of them are longer phrases like 'at all' or 'a thing' or 'an iota,' 'a drop.' You can get verbs like 'budge.'"
56,104,Lauren,In a sentence like?
56,105,Gretchen,"Like, 'The boulder won't budge.' You don't say, 'The bolder will budge.'"
56,106,Lauren,"Hmm. I guess some of these are like, 'Huh.' Sorry. I'm just gonna take a moment to consult my intuitions there because, yeah, I guess not."
56,107,Gretchen,"I might be able to say, 'budge over,' or something to a person. Then you have whole phrases like, 'breathe a word,' 'hold a candle,' 'sleep a wink,' 'lift a finger.'"
56,108,Lauren,'I couldn't sleep a wink.'
56,109,Gretchen,'Couldn't sleep a wink.' 'I could sleep a wink.' [Laughter] 'I could lift a finger.'
56,110,Lauren,"When you put them into the affirmative, they don't work. It also shows why they're just called 'negative polarity' rather than 'negation' because they bring this negative sense with them, but they are not doing grammatical negating themselves. There's no 'no' or 'not' or 'un-' in there."
56,111,Gretchen,"That's what distinguishes them from something like, 'no one,' 'nowhere,' 'nothing,' which are themselves already negative words. If you think about the polarity of a phrase as like, I guess, if you go away from the equator -- let's say you go north for negation because they both begin with N. As you head towards the North Pole, your negative polarity gets higher."
56,112,Lauren,"As someone who lives on a continent that is often called the 'antipodes' because we are on the opposite side of the world from the Northern Hemisphere, I appreciate that you're putting north as your deficit for negation. Thank you."
56,113,Gretchen,"It just, I dunno, acronyms -- they're nice."
56,114,Lauren,"N for 'north,' N for 'negation.' Negative polarity items are just sending you in that direction without necessarily being negative themselves."
56,115,Gretchen,"What's interesting about them is that although they're called 'negative polarity items' because of this canonical contrast where you say, 'There aren't any here,' versus 'There are any here,' which is weird because it doesn't have the negation, there are also some other contexts where you can say stuff like this. You can say negative polarity items in questions often. 'Do you see any?' Or in if-clauses."
56,116,Lauren,And if-clauses are famous for not existing quite in our reality. That's one of the things they're doing.
56,117,Gretchen,"'If you make a peep, you'll get in trouble.' The 'if' part of that, you know, somehow that works for negative polarity. And also contexts with words like 'without' or 'doubt' or 'surprise' or 'regret.' That's something like, 'I regret lifting a finger to help.' You're not gonna say, 'I lifted a finger to help,' because that one's weird, but as soon as you regret lifting a finger, somehow that one works fairly well."
56,118,Lauren,"So, they're not just doing straight up negating, there's something more complicated happening there."
56,119,Gretchen,"This is something that's still an active area of research to figure out exactly what all the contexts are because some of the negative polarity items work better in some contexts than others, so there can be a bit of fuzziness around the borders for which ones work when. The theories for the reasons behind those conditions can get fairly complicated. It's interesting to have this observation of like, here's this whole class of words. You knew about nouns and verbs, but negative polarity items, they've been there this whole time, and yet you didn't realise they had this unifying characteristic of them."
56,120,Lauren,"There might be some times when something that's listed as a negative polarity item actually works in the affirmative for some people and why intuition checking becomes a big part of thinking about this because I've definitely met some people who can use 'anymore,' which I can only use in negative like, 'I don't have a dinosaur anymore.'"
56,121,Gretchen,Oh no! What happened to it?
56,122,Lauren,"But there are some English speakers who can use 'anymore' in a positive sentence. Whenever I hear it, I'm like, 'Oh, that works for you,' but I literally can't even come up with an example in my head because it doesn't work in my variety of English."
56,123,Gretchen,"I have a fun story about positive 'anymore,' which is, I didn't have it growing up. I encountered it in grad school in this very like, 'Did you know that in some varieties of English people have positive 'anymore'?' I was reading the examples and being told these examples. It's something like, 'Cake is expensive anymore.'"
56,124,Lauren,Alas.
56,125,Gretchen,Where it means 'nowadays.'
56,126,Lauren,I can totally understand it functioning when you use it in a sentence like that. It's not like my brain can't process the meaning at all. It's just not something I would say.
56,127,Gretchen,"I actually went to a linguistics conference, and I went to a workshop by a linguist who had positive 'anymore.' The first time I heard him say it in the wild, I was like, 'Oh, this is this thing that I read about in the books.' Three days later, I'd heard this linguist on enough occasions say enough tokens of positive 'anymore' that I'm like, 'Yeah, it's grammatical for me now.' I acquired it in this week in 2012."
56,128,Lauren,Amazing.
56,129,Gretchen,"Sometimes, the only reason you don't have positive 'anymore' is because you only have negative evidence to suggest that it doesn't exist."
56,130,Lauren,I just haven't been exposed to it.
56,131,Gretchen,"Then I have probably, I dunno, probably less than a dozen tokens of positive evidence in this naturalistic setting from this linguist who didn't realise that he was grammatically teaching me to use positive 'anymore.' He thought he was doing a workshop on a perfectly unrelated topic, and yet I walked out of that being like, 'Yeah, it's grammatical for me,' and it has been ever since."
56,132,Lauren,You are an inspiration for lifelong grammatical acquisition.
56,133,Gretchen,Right! Because I was an adult. It was great.
56,134,Lauren,"You called it 'positive anymore.' So, the fact that we have negative polarity items, can I intuit that there are also positive polarity items?"
56,135,Gretchen,"Yeah. There aren't as many, but one of them is--"
56,136,Lauren,"Interesting. Again, this obsession with marking negation."
56,137,Gretchen,"We mark negation a lot more. But one of them is 'somewhat.' You can say, 'I liked that cake somewhat.'"
56,138,Lauren,We're definitely not moving as close to the positive pole with the 'somewhat' there.
56,139,Gretchen,'I didn't like that cake somewhat' is just kind of ugh for a lot of people.
56,140,Lauren,That doesn't work for me.
56,141,Gretchen,"There're a few positive polarity items as well that move people further towards the South Pole, if you will."
56,142,Lauren,"I like that talking about positive polarity items has moved us full circle through negation and back into thinking about negation and thinking about negative structures and affirmative structures as all part of this larger, more complicated system of ways that we have of expressing that things exist or they don't exist and how we go about talking about that.

57,1,Gretchen,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics. I'm Gretchen McCulloch. I'm here with Jade Abbot and Bonaventure Dossou from the Masakhane Initiative. Today we're getting enthusiastic about natural language processing research in African languages -- for Africans, by Africans. Hello! Welcome to the show."
57,2,Jade,"Thank you for having us, Gretchen, hi."
57,3,Bona,Hi. Thank you for having us.
57,4,Gretchen,"Thank you both for coming. I know that Masakhane is a big group of people. So, you are two parts of it, but there are other people who are also involved. Let's start with backing up a step and talking about how you both got interested in language in the first place. Jade, do you wanna start?"
57,5,Jade,"Of course. I got interested in language from a very young age when I -- I originate from South Africa, which has a very traumatic past with a lot of division. One of the things, when I was growing up, I noticed that I was never taught to speak African languages despite the fact I was living in South Africa. When I did try and learn the languages, I ended up with a lot of anxiety trying to get through this. Being in computer science, I turned to technology as a means to do this. The reason that it mattered to me so much was -- and I don't wanna be the cheesy person to quote Nelson Mandela, but I'm gonna do it because he says when you speak to someone in a language they understand, it goes to their head. If you speak to them in their own language, it goes to their heart. This I fundamentally believe on the importance of communication. For me it was a matter of bridging not only just a communication divide but also a cultural divide and bringing people together. This is why I cared a lot about language. It was from that point of view, that feeling, that the Masakhane Initiative was envisioned from my side. I started getting into it from a technological perspective and being like, 'How can we use technology to support either translation of these languages or using them in a technological space?' We realised that there was just nothing -- no research. Nothing was available. That's what spawned off Masakhane."
57,6,Gretchen,"Cool. And Bona, how did you start getting involved with this?"
57,7,Bona,"I grew up in Benin -- a country where French is spoken. And also, like Jade, I did not get much exposed to my native language, which is Fon and also Igbo, simply because, in Benin, everything is done in French. Also at school, I mean, you were forced to speak French. Otherwise, if you were caught speaking the language, I mean, your native language and everything, you could have been punished or expelled from the school, either temporarily or even definitively. I always had passion for language but not my native language. I had passion for English because I wanted to become a computer scientist. I wanted to travel abroad, do great things, and everything. I knew that English will be definitely important for me. As a matter of fact, I was a very, very big fan of Michael Jackson. I used to buy his CDs. I used to go on the internet and google the lyrics and look at the sounds, trying to understand every meaning of the lyrics because I believed that understanding the song could help me to dance better somehow. Yeah, that's how I got interested in language. But only recently when I travelled abroad in Russia, I had a lot of communication issues, mainly with my mom who cannot really speak well French. That's basically from where the whole RAS idea of working on African languages started. Like they say, great and beautiful minds always meet together, so finally we made Masakhane. So, here we are today."
57,8,Gretchen,"The Masakhane Initiative started in 2019, is that right?"
57,9,Jade,Yes.
57,10,Gretchen,"And Bona, you got involved in 2020?"
57,11,Bona,"Yeah, I remember it was January 2020."
57,12,Gretchen,"What an interesting time to get involved in something. You two are part of this organisation. Do you wanna talk a bit more about how -- maybe, Jade, this is a question for you -- people started coming together and forming groups and collaborations and so on within this project?"
57,13,Jade,"How it started was we were sitting -- me and it was my co-author, Laura, who was the person I used to originally write these publications with around African languages -- we were at a conference -- the ACL conference."
57,14,Gretchen,That's the Association of Computational Linguistics?
57,15,Jade,Yes.
57,16,Gretchen,Not the American one. There are ones in lots of areas.
57,17,Jade,There are a whole bunch. There isn't one in African yet.associate [Laughs]
57,18,Gretchen,Yet.
57,19,Jade,Yet.
57,20,Gretchen,You could change that.
57,21,Jade,"Yes. We were publishing at what they call the 'WiNLP,' the Widening Natural Language Processing workshop. When we were there, we realised we were one of two groups of African attendees. The one group was from Ethiopia and the other group was us -- to the point where researchers who cared about low-resource languages were actively seeking us out to be like, 'Oh, great, we have people from the continent of Africa here! We should meet them.' From chatting to everyone and from our own research, we realised that the problem is so dire. There's so little representation of African languages in language technology that we needed to build a pan-African wide community. Thankfully, there's a great initiative called the Deep Learning Indaba. The goal of the Deep Learning Indaba is to strengthen machine learning in Africa. They deal with all aspects of machine learning. What they essentially did is brought together researchers and industry professionals from around the continent and put them through these workshops. What was great was that I knew that I could go present this idea of, hey, let's build a community for African languages. Let's make these NLP tools. Let's work together. And then let's write this huge paper with 50 authors to show people how we're gonna change the world. What was great is that we already had a big group of people who were involved. Initially, we started up already with 50 people from all over the continent who were active in the Slack groups and helping write code. Right now, since that moment, we've been working virtually. When the pandemic happened, and suddenly everyone was confined, we had little to no change. In fact, it might've been the opposite. I think people had a lot more spare time to work on -- [laughs] -- to work on it."
57,22,Gretchen,"Because you were already doing things across the entire continent, and so you were collaborating virtually anyway, so didn't change that much. You were piggybacking on an existing group of people who were interested in technology stuff and saying, 'Hey, maybe you should care about technology and language together'?"
57,23,Jade,"Yes, pretty much. There was already a group caring about it, but we said, 'Let's make a focus group. Let's write a paper together. Let's try to solve this representation issue as a group.'"
57,24,Gretchen,"How did you get involved, Bona?"
57,25,Bona,"I remember it was -- I mean, the story was funny because I was -- sorry. If I can go a little bit back to give more context. I was working at a company, and I built let me call it a 'translation tool' that I was using -- I mean, that had the languages of Google Translate, but I was not really using Google Translate. I did in Python, and I tried to implement the API and everything, integrate into the application that I was also building. It was an African social network application. I integrated it to the feed. For instance, I publish something in English or French, someone else can see it in Yoruba or whatever. I mean, those languages, for example, are on Google Translate. I also integrated it to the chat, so that if I write something in French, you decide in which language you want me to see. We run into a conflict of -- I won't call it 'conflict of interest' -- but I built the whole thing because of my interest in NLP, which is also dependent on another let me say 'environment.' It happened to my brother/colleague, Chris, and I when we were in Russia. That would be too long to talk about. Finally, the one IT thing, the product and everything, talking about intellectual property and everything -- iPhone, iPhone, iPhone. Finally, I gave up. After Chris joined us -- Chris is the one that brought that idea of working on African languages. We started working on Lingala. I didn't go quite well because we're trying to let them know how it should be. But they were like, 'Who are you? How dare you? How can you speak like that? Who do you think you are?' And then things went down, down, down, broke down, and broke down, and finally, we left. Finally, we left. Then we were actively looking for people working on those ideas -- those African languages. We left the company somewhere in November. Then in December I think it was Chris who found on Twitter exactly Deep Learning Indaba, which was retweeting about AI for development. They talked about that platform, Zindi. Then there was a contest about African languages data set. We're like, okay, great. That's a good idea. Then we just jumped in, and we started working on gathering data for Fon and everything. And I mean, you know, when you retweet, retweet, retweet, you finally can reach the source, right? In one of those retweets, I found the Twitter post of Masakhane, and then I went to them, and I said, I was like, 'I should' -- I was like, wow, this is great if we can join and everything. Chris was like, 'Well, let's wait. Maybe there are only professionals there. Let us finish because we're still undergraduates.' Everything we've been doing now we honestly just planned it for NOW-now -- I mean, to start now or to start after we graduate from the masters. But I was like, 'Okay, I don't care.' Most of the time it's like that. Chris is a little bit of a pessimist, and I'm just like, okay, I just do it. The worst that can happen is it doesn't work, but then at least I have tried. I just went to the website, and there was a form to fill out, so I sent both of our CVs and everything. Yeah, we just got accepted. We just got in. That's how it started."
57,26,Jade,"For context, Gretchen, Bona comes as a duo. It's usually Bona and Chris. I met them together."
57,27,Gretchen,"It's technical limitations that prevent us from interviewing all three of you. There's a really interesting presentation if people wanna see some of the faces of more of the group of Masakhane. The video presentation that you did a few months ago, which we can link to, that has snippets from about, what, 10 or so people and different parts of the project that they're involved with."
57,28,Jade,"It was a very fun talk. We took full advantage of the digital format, and edited -- and edited, and edited -- with a whole bunch of people and made things move around."
57,29,Gretchen,"It's such a good talk because a lot of conference talks are like, okay, here's one person, and there's a bad-quality video over some slides. Yours is actually a multimedia thing. There's music, and there's little animations of the people moving in and out. I think it's just a really beautiful video, especially considering that it was originally a conference talk, which are often pretty boring."
57,30,Jade,"That was actually all edited by Chris, I think. The amount of energy that went into editing that and putting it together and coordinating so many people."
57,31,Gretchen,"All the talks fit together really well. Of course, none of you would've been in the same location at all."
57,32,Jade,"If we'd done this conference talk, we would not have all been there, right, just simply due to visa issues and costs. We could never have done this if it weren't digital."
57,33,Gretchen,You're not gonna fly a dozen people to a conference to give a single talk where each of them talks for five minutes or something like that.
57,34,Jade,"I mean, we would do that. It's just that we probably wouldn't get everyone in."
57,35,Gretchen,It'd just be a lot of logistical issues preventing it.
57,36,Jade,"So many. The logistical issues that face Africans outweigh the logistical issues for many parts of the world. For instance, the majority of Africa struggles to get into the US. They've had multiple instances of conference goers -- people who are running and organising a conference -- cannot get a visa for Canada, where the conference is being held. It's actually really interesting to see how a lot of people in this conference -- conferences changed from being something really dull and boring, but it actually enabled so few people from around the world, especially from Africa, to actually attend and participate."
57,37,Gretchen,"So, there's some benefits to the digital conferences because now you don't need a visa."
57,38,Jade,No. [Laughs]
57,39,Gretchen,This maybe gets us into talking about how you've also creatively subverted the traditional authorship models when it comes to writing papers as a collective for Masakhane.
57,40,Jade,"Yeah, it was really interesting because we have this idea, and it's particularly rare in the technology sphere, where typically you have the researchers, and then you've got everyone else in the world. Everyone else is things being studied, data being collected, participants. They're not actually part of the research process. We said everyone who contributed, no matter how big or small -- so, was it an edit you did, was it a model you contributed, was it a small evaluation you did -- you were added as an author. We were sitting discussing, and we had 50 authors on this paper, and we're trying to figure out what order they should be in. We randomised it. We set it from reverse alphabetical because that's, you know, fine. Then someone was like, 'Hey, why don't we just put a symbol to represent the community?' because that's actually what we want the first author to be."
57,41,Gretchen,"Especially with a paper with 50 authors, it often gets cited as 'So-and-So et al.'"
57,42,Jade,Exactly.
57,43,Gretchen,"And yet, if that turns into 'Abbott et al.' that looks like it's your project, which it's not. You're trying to decentralise that."
57,44,Jade,Yeah. We added in the for all symbol as our first author.
57,45,Gretchen,That's this upside-down capital A.
57,46,Jade,"The mathematical symbol, yeah. It's the whole set, right. It's actually encapsulated in our logo. If you look at the Masakhane logo, there's actually a for all symbol located in there amongst it. We did that. The conferences weren't happy. They kept trying to ignore the symbol. We kept trying to argue otherwise. It turns out they don't represent the character sets on the proceedings websites. That's a bit strange to me."
57,47,Gretchen,"Especially for something that's a computational linguistics conference, you would think that they would have Unicode support and the ability to support special characters and things. Because lots of people actually have those in their names as well."
57,48,Jade,"Yes. By the end of it, I wasn't sure if it was a technical incapability, or if they just didn't want to set a precedent that you can just do this, but I can't see why you shouldn't be able to just do this. This seems fine. We should be able to have symbols as authors. If we can have cats at 10th authors and dogs as 5th authors, then why can't we have a symbol?"
57,49,Gretchen,"There are, indeed, famously papers that have cats sometimes as a co-author. To talk about some of the specific projects that people have been working on under the whole Masakhane umbrella -- Bona, I know you've been making a translator for Fon."
57,50,Bona,"Yeah. Masakhane is a huge family. Of course, the focus is on NLP. We first started as a machine translation community, mainly, and then broadened to more topics of NLP, like speech and everything. It started with a translation engine for Fon, which is my native language widely spoken in Benin -- the most spoken language if we discount the colonial language and administrative language, which is French. So, we basically started by Fon. Thankfully, we managed, and the platform's actually already online -- useful. We got thousands, already, of translation solutions -- feedbacks and everything. We've been working on many things. The other second major thing is a speech recognition model for Fon and for Igbo. For Fon, it's actually -- I mean, it's already working. We have a model working even though for Fon it was merged better. For Fon, we made it public, and it's also hosted on the website of HuggingFace, so people can actually just go there, register their voices, and then have the transcription. That's basically what I'm working on. But there are other people who have focused on the same thing, like MT, machine translation, for the languages like Yoruba and everything. There's been recognition as well -- Named Entity Recognition and Part of Speech plus tagging and everything, so some things are broad actually. Somehow, we might need to get at least a bit of each of the members. I think that's how the strength is built."
57,51,Gretchen,"It was neat. I was going on your website earlier last week and clicking around and saying, okay, I can try to use this Fon translator. I can type something in in French because, you know, I speak French, and then it presents me with this result. I have, obviously, no way of telling whether it's a good Fon translation or not because I don't speak it. But it looked like it was doing something, which was all that I could evaluate. That's the whole problem because not everyone necessarily speaks every language involved there. But the thing that I did notice was that it had an option for 'Is this translation incorrect?', 'Do you wanna change something?', and presumably you're using that to help improve the translator."
57,52,Bona,"Yes. You're definitely right. We included that to have much more translations to include more people. Because I work on the project with Chris and with two other people who are not computer scientists, who are not in the field of data science, NLP. They're just like the linguistics people -- like journalists, media communicators, and everything. So, they don't actually know anything about those tools, but they had us checking the quality of the translation and everything. On our site, we wanted to have more data, more translations, to improve the service, but we knew we could not do it alone. We knew that it would make a huge difference involving people that speak the language. This is what made us put that form, so that people could suggest translations and score the translations. The translation score which happens to fit the -- because if someone is giving a translation with a confidence score of 1 over 5, we are actually not really sure that we'll go for it. Maybe we select it, but then we won't give it much more attention than someone who is sure -- who has given a 2.5 or 4 over 5 to the translation he suggested."
57,53,Gretchen,"Because some users could be trolls or something and not giving very good results, and then you won't be able to filter for which of those translations are good. One of the things with machine translation and with natural language processing and stuff in general is it generally needs a whole lot of data, right, to do it. Especially for translation, you need translation pairs where you have something that's 'Here's a bit in one language. Here's a bit in another language that corresponds to it,' and then eventually if you have enough of these, you can try to teach the computer to produce other translations. What are the challenges with getting some of this data in the first place and keeping on doing things with it afterwards?"
57,54,Jade,"I mean, what's fun about the majority of the languages we see that translation systems exist for is you can just go on the internet and scrape these parallel corpuses and do something that they call 'alignment,' which tries to say, okay, these are the sentences that are parallel. Typically, people will use Wikipedia as a good example to try and source these parallel pairs. They'll use news websites where they've got translations for them. That's all good and well for languages which are well-represented on the internet. But for many of the African languages, that is simply not the case. In fact, sometimes even the keyboards, in order to type in that language, don't even exist. Bona actually worked on one for Fon so that people could download it to use it."
57,55,Gretchen,"So, it does now, but it didn't."
57,56,Jade,"Yeah, and it didn't. Or spellcheckers don't exist in those languages. So, there's also been a recent project by one of our collaborators, Sabelo Mhlambi, who's also put together a number of spell checkers for Southern African languages. So, it doesn't exist. I think what's really interesting when you speak to Western or people who are not used to working with low-resource languages, they contact us, and they want to find out what websites can we scrape. We have to come back and say, 'No, no, you have to hire people to translate,' or 'You need to go back into archives and look up stuff.'"
57,57,Gretchen,You need to take three steps back and actually start at this earlier thing.
57,58,Jade,"We've had really fun stories of, for instance, the South African parliament got a great law that says we have to translate all of our parliamentary proceedings into as many of our 11 official languages, which apparently does happen but doesn't get published. The only way we got a hold of that data was one of the translators for parliament happens to be on our project. She was like, 'I can get the data. I can even get permission. You just have to help me with this really annoying tool that I can't figure out to get it out of there.'"
57,59,Gretchen,Because they're all in PDFs or something annoying?
57,60,Jade,"They're in PDFs. Sometimes they're in DOCXs. You have to download them from some weird FTP. You can only do it in tiny batches because otherwise the system falls over. It's like trying to get it, and they're like, 'You can have it,' but it's like, 'But how? How do we get to it?' We've had a couple of participants get really involved and saying, you know, they wanna really dictate what gets translated. So, not just what's already been translated; they wanna translate or use translations -- they wanna capture any data about their language in question, and they wanna decide what goes in. They don't want it to be what's typically available, which is -- religious texts are very widely translated. That's the majority of what we have. They go into their communities. They sit with their grandmother on a Sunday, drink coffee, and work together. She'll translate from English into your language and write it up, and then we'd collect those pieces of paper. Someone would scan them in. Someone would then type it up using their own keyboard if they can get a hold of it. There's quite a lengthy process, which is part preservation and part totally can be used to build tools that can facilitate learning these languages. If we don't do that, then the models do very strange things."
57,61,Gretchen,"Well, I imagine religious texts, most people don't talk like a religious text in their ordinary life."
57,62,Jade,"No, they don't."
57,63,Gretchen,"The language model only understands what it's already seen. You could try to say something pretty normal, and it would make it sound like a weird prophesy or something."
57,64,Jade,"We do that over the -- in one of our first papers, we did an analysis. Someone said, 'Oh, we need to translate COVID-19 surveys. You should use machine translation.' We said, 'That's gonna be a fun evaluation exercise.' There's no way you can use anything that comes out of it. But it was a great demonstration to show the failures of this process."
57,65,Gretchen,Because all of this medical vocabulary is not gonna be in the religious text that you're using.
57,66,Jade,"Yeah. For instance, Canada got translated into 'Canaan.' Things became biblified."
57,67,Gretchen,"Like, Canaan, oh no. [Laughter]"
57,68,Jade,"That would keep happening, so we got a lot of that. We used that as an evaluation exercise, so we'd have a native speaker come and correct whatever the machine did. It was quite a lot for us but also a little bit horrifying if you're thinking that people are actually training these models without knowing how good or bad they are because they don't have a team who understands it."
57,69,Gretchen,"I imagine giving someone this advice, you know, 'Save yourself from the plague of locusts' or something 'by going to Canaan,' and you're like, 'Wait. No. There's got to be something going on here, but I don't know what it is.'"
57,70,Jade,"'What are you trying to tell me, computer? Why are you telling me this?'"
57,71,Gretchen,Now you must have a bunch of translated data from COVID announcements and the pandemic and things like that because a lot of those did get produced in lots of languages.
57,72,Jade,"I think some of them we do have. I don't think we've done a recent gathering of them. We probably should and just kind of bolster our training sets. I think we're still overwhelmingly dominated by religious text, but we're sorting that out. There's a number of funds that have come through, and they want to -- for example, Bona was talking earlier about these Zindi competitions. Zindi is a data science platform where someone will release a data set or a challenge, and programmers will go on -- or data scientists will go on -- and participate in this competition. Zindi is an African data science platform. One of our close collaborators was running a competition that was I think funded by UNESCO. The goal there was to fund creation of data sets, which was really helpful. Now we have data sets that are being created, which means people go get things annotated. They work with journalists to get things written. We knew people who were working on annotating and translating their masters theses or a collection of poems they'd written to do this. There're some funds that are available to do so. So, instead of scraping, we go and create more content and try and spur that into the world so that we have more."
57,73,Gretchen,"That's really neat. Of course, as Bona was just saying, once you can put some sort of machine translation or something up then you can also get people to contribute directly to rating it and adding new things."
57,74,Jade,"Exactly. Which is what we've done. We actually recently deployed translate.masakhane.io where we have a number of English to about 67 African languages. We actually have 38 models that currently exist, we just haven't deployed them all. Right now, it only goes English into the African languages, but we've swapped that around, so it does from African languages to English, too, and then also from African language to African language. It's also this idea of extending participation from the Masakhane group, which is quite large, but extending that to as many people across the continent who'd like to participate and add translations."
57,75,Gretchen,"That's great. I guess there's sort of, at the individual levels, a bunch of people are still gonna keep making projects underneath that. Bona, do you wanna talk about where you see things going? What's next for you and what else you're working on?"
57,76,Bona,"Okay. What's next? I think it depends. I think already the bigger and the main goal of the family or the community is already, I mean, being step-by-step, slowly and steadily achieved. People know more now about African languages. People are more conscious about it, about the challenges. We're seeing more tools are created. African languages have much more visibility now. I think it was hard to even find a paper that was talking about Fon because it simply did not. But actually, thanks to the Masakhane community, Chris, and I, and everything, there are not a lot but at least already more than two, three, and everything. On the personal side, Jade mentioned African to African, which is good to me and also to Chris. We started with an MT, machine translation. Now, we're done, and we're still working on speech. That's basically, like, an MT, speech, and maybe we'll do that cycle and actually more to something else. We also talk about organisation to improve the translation quality. So, me, I'm very interested in a future where, for instance, we could have an assistant with which we could just talk in Fon. Instead of having Siri or Alexa to which we are speaking French or English, we could have those assistants to which we are speaking our languages. That would fun."
57,77,Gretchen,"Yeah, that would be great."
57,78,Bona,"That would actually give a whole more sense to everything we are working on -- having those language models that we are training integrated to mobile phones. On the keyboard, we are building all the spellcheckers that Jade mentioned. Those being integrated to every daily technology -- phones, laptops, and everything -- I think that would be a milestone. I don't know what would come after that, but I think that would be already a very great step."
57,79,Gretchen,"By the time you get there, you could notice other things that you want as well."
57,80,Bona,"Yes, definitely. One step at a time, like they used to say."
57,81,Gretchen,Absolutely. Masakhane won an award from Wikimedia for a lot of this work in this area.
57,82,Bona,"Yes, Masakhane did. We all did. [Laughs]"
57,83,Jade,It was really cool because Bona and Chris accepted the award directly from Jimmy Wales himself and gave beautiful acceptance speeches. I think they're somewhere on the internet if anyone wants to go listen. They're great.
57,84,Gretchen,"Oh, we find the links for those."
57,85,Jade,"Yeah, they're lovely."
57,86,Gretchen,"If somebody says, 'Wow, this is really cool! I hadn't thought about this before. I wanna learn more about this project,' or 'I wanna get more involved with this project,' what would you suggest they go to?"
57,87,Bona,"First of all, I think, of course, I would invite them to come to the community first. I think people will benefit a lot from it because we have weekly mentoring sessions studying NLPs, weekly meetings. People are working on very cool and interesting projects. It doesn't matter if they are beginners, if they are computer scientists, or whatever. Everybody is taken like a baby, and then we grow step-by-step together. Then already when they join, they can now have their own interest. Depending on their interest, they now can move to anything they want. We can check the papers written by Jade and Laura or maybe the paper I wrote with Chris, the papers the community writes, like the paper for which we got the Wikimedia award -- the Paper of the Year award. I mean, there are a lot of things, actually, you can do. Thankfully with our work, not to be too much showing off with our work, there're actually much more, already, accounts and much more publications, much more resources, that can be found online for anybody that wants to start working on African low-resource languages."
57,88,Gretchen,"Awesome. We'll link to some of those in the show notes, so if people wanna follow a link to the Masakhane website or to other places. Jade, any resources that you'd leave people with?"
57,89,Jade,"I would recommend anyone who's interested to get a hold of a book by a Kenyan author Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o called Decolonizing the Mind: The Politics of Language in African Literature. This book is probably one of the most impactful books for African language even though he wasn't a linguist. He was just an author. He was an author who, after writing this, chose to only write in his native language of Gikuyu. It situates one of the big Masakhane beliefs which is -- I'll actually, if I may, read a quote, where he says, 'Language carries culture. Culture carries, particularly through art or literature, the entire body of values by which we come to perceive ourselves and our place in the world. How people perceive themselves affects how they look at their culture, at their politics, and at their social production of wealth, and their entire relationship to nature and to other beings. Language is, thus, inseparable from ourselves as a community of human beings with a specific form and character, a specific history, a specific relationship to the world.' This is what Masakhane calls for is this idea of I think what happens a lot in language technologies here is language is seen as data, and data is just seen as something you put in and out of a machine, whereas only if we start acknowledging language for what it is, a representation of human beings and human culture, then we can actually start building tools that actually aid humanity rather than just exploit. It's also how we propose solving this low-resourced issue that's facing African languages. Yeah, I would recommend this book to anyone. It's basically a series of essays around his thoughts around African literature and playwrights and stories."
57,90,Gretchen,That sounds great. I'm gonna have to check it out.
57,91,Jade,It's great.
57,92,Gretchen,"That almost brings us to a close. But we always like to give our guests one more chance to say, 'If you could leave people knowing one thing about language or about the problems that you work on, what would that be?'"
57,93,Bona,"I would just say that -- I forgot the name of the author. It's a lady who said that -- I don't really remember word-for-word -- but what she was saying was basically that working on language is much more complicated than any other parallel that we could imagine. Like Jade was saying from wa Thiong'o, language carries a lot of things with itself. It carries the principles. It carries the values. It carries the culture. It carries heritage. It carries a lot of things that altogether give an identity to a human being -- a group of human beings. I would say language is very important. Language matters. If our bigger -- I mean, our bigger vision of putting Africa on the NLP map but more generally putting, let me say, AI in the heart of Africa's development, then it's a necessary and compulsory start by giving value to our languages by promoting our cultures and everything. Because if we don't do it, nobody else will do it for us. I think we've been waiting and waiting for too long. It's time for us to get things going by ourselves. [Music]"

57,95,Bona,Stay lingthusiastic!
57,96,Jade,Stay lingthusiastic! [Music]
58,1,Gretchen,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics! I'm Gretchen McCulloch."
58,2,Lauren,"I'm Lauren Gawne. Today, we're getting enthusiastic about fricatives. But first, we have new merch. We now have kiki bouba merch available in the Lingthusiasm store."
58,3,Gretchen,"This is from a classic psycholinguistics experiment where you show people two shapes, a spikey one and a rounded one, and you ask them which one is called 'bouba' and which one is called 'kiki.' You can now conduct this experiment with your friends and acquaintances using your scarf, mug, notebook, etc."
58,4,Lauren,"You may recall bouba and kiki from our episode, 'What words sound spikey across languages?' which was a chat that I had with psycholinguist Suzy Styles. If you haven't listened to that yet, there is a treat awaiting you."
58,5,Gretchen,"We've also expanded the range of items that you can get with our IPA esoteric symbols designs. Also, we have an exciting new merch range that we're going to tell you about towards the end of this episode because it'll make more sense then."
58,6,Lauren,Indeed.
58,7,Gretchen,So tantalising.
58,8,Lauren,"If you have listened to our episode about kiki and bouba and all of our other main episodes and would like to listen to bonus episodes, our most recent Patreon episode was about speaking under the influence. There's that and 52 other bonus episodes awaiting you."
58,9,Gretchen,You can see links to our merch both new and old from lingthusiasm.com/merch or any of our social media. [Music]
58,10,Lauren,"I have a list of words, Gretchen. Are you ready to figure out what they all have in common?"
58,11,Gretchen,I am so ready.
58,12,Lauren,I can promise you it's nothing semantic.
58,13,Gretchen,"Okay, that's a good start."
58,14,Lauren,"You can try and start a story with these. 'Fan,' 'vote,' 'thing,' 'than,' 'seep,' 'shin,' 'zhuzh,' and 'hand.' 'And' is not one of the words."
58,15,Gretchen,"I mean, now that you've issued this challenge, I feel like I do need to construct a story with them. But I'm gonna play along and say I think what these have in common is that they all start with a particular type of sound."
58,16,Lauren,"They do, indeed. They all are produced with some kind of friction in your mouth where you can feel it's like turbulence in between two parts of your mouth. They're all different parts."
58,17,Gretchen,"So, when I make a /f/ or /z/ or /h/, I'm making some degree of constriction. I'm pushing some parts together a little bit, and then I'm forcing the air through, and that turbulence or that gush of air is making this very friction-y sound."
58,18,Lauren,"That flow of air is very different to a sound where a part of your mouth is fully closed, like /p/ or /t/. These sounds like 'vote' or 'shin' can really go on as long as you have air in your lungs."
58,19,Gretchen,"At the same time, your mouth isn't fully open like /a/ /i/ where you're doing a full vowel. You're definitely creating a point of constriction in your mouth, it's just that it's not a completely closed off bit of air."
58,20,Lauren,"That constriction creates friction, and that's why these types of sounds are known as 'fricatives.' One of the best ways that I have of remembering fricatives is the phrase, 'Fricative parties don't stop,' because you get that continuing rush of air."
58,21,Gretchen,"Ah, yes. You can do the continuing rush of air. And also, because this is even funnier if you know that these sounds like P and D where the air does stop in your mouth are technically known as 'stops.' So, the fricative party is not a stop -- I think this was one of the first linguistics memes I encountered was about the fricative party doesn't stop."
58,22,Lauren,I've definitely seen it on posters and t-shirts. It's a good one. It's good if you use it to remember this type of sound. We're gonna take a tour of some of our favourite fricatives in this episode.
58,23,Gretchen,"With the caveat that the fricatives row of the International Phonetic Alphabet is the most populated row of sounds. There are a lot of fricatives. We're not gonna get to all of them. This is an express train tour that doesn't stop at all of the stops. Oh, wow, no, I can't say the word 'stop' anymore."
58,24,Lauren,"This metaphor has failed very early on. We will be visiting some of our favourite fricatives. If you have other fricative stories or facts that you want to share, please feel free to talk about them in the patron Discord or you can tag Lingthusiasm on social media, and we might be able to share them."
58,25,Gretchen,There are more fricative stories that we have not told. Please continue the fricative party. May it never stop.
58,26,Lauren,"The best place is start is probably with the /f/ in 'fricative,' which is a fricative itself."
58,27,Gretchen,"This is my favourite type of linguistic terminology. Not all linguistics terminology is as convenient as this, but 'fricative' begins with a fricative. It's very convenient and easy to remember that way."
58,28,Lauren,"I feel like we've done some other self-defining terminology episodes. We've done one on rhotics, which starts with a /ɹ/."
58,29,Gretchen,"That's true. Unfortunately, we've done an episode on schwa, which does not have a schwa in it but used to. There used to be /ʃəwa/. It doesn't always happen, but occasionally it's very nice."
58,30,Lauren,It's very satisfying when it does. The other fricative in 'fricative' is --
58,31,Gretchen,"Ah, there's a second one!"
58,32,Lauren,"Yeah, /f/ and /v/ are made at exactly the same place in the mouth, usually with your lower lip touching your upper teeth. The difference between them is that the /f/ sound doesn't involve any vibration, whereas if you make the /v/ sound nothing else has changed, but you'll feel that buzzing of vibration in your vocal cords while you make it."
58,33,Gretchen,"I think this is the point where we start saying, all right, it's a rite of passage for every budding linguist to be going around saying sounds with your hand on your throat thinking about, 'What are my lips and tongue doing right now' because you're so used to doing this automatically, you don't think about it overtly anymore. If you find yourself doing that at this episode, rest assured you are entirely normal. If people are giving you strange looks, that is their problem."
58,34,Lauren,Special shout out to people who are commuting on public transport while listening to this episode.
58,35,Gretchen,"I'm so sorry. You know, make sure if you're trying to do this under your breath, you're not gonna get this vocal cord distinction if you're whispering because that's what whispering is. It's just not using your vocal cords. You will need to say it a little bit louder if you wanna be able to feel that difference. Brought to you by me as a teenager not knowing this and having a real difficult time."
58,36,Lauren,Learning the hard way.
58,37,Gretchen,Yep. [Laughs]
58,38,Lauren,"So, English has a /f/ in a word like 'fine,' and /v/ in a word like 'vine,' but English hasn't always had a V of its own."
58,39,Gretchen,"You get these pairs in English of words like 'knife/knives,' 'wolf/wolves,' 'leaf/leaves,' where you make it plural and then the F changes to V. This was this spelling thing that I had to learn as a kid in school, but there're historical reasons for that."
58,40,Lauren,"When a sound that doesn't have vibrations sits between two vowels, which are made with those vibrations, the efficient thing to do is just keep the vibrations happening throughout that little string of sounds -- instead of 'leafs.'"
58,41,Gretchen,"The complicated thing here, right, is that when you write 'wolf/wolves' or 'leaf/leaves,' you change the F to a V and add E-S, which is the thing I learned in school. But you do that because at one point, first of all, the E was pronounced. It was like /lifəz/ or something like that. Then that E that was pronounced changed the F to a V. Then we stopped pronouncing the E -- the silent E -- but we kept the relic of it in the different pronunciation of the F as V."
58,42,Lauren,"This is not unique to English. This kind of sound change happens across languages quite often. That happened in the middle of words, but then the other thing that happened to English was French turned up, and French does have that V sound at the start of words as well. So, if an English word has a /v/ at the beginning, there's a very high chance that that was borrowed from French."
58,43,Gretchen,"Now, English has words like 'vine' and 'very' and things like that that got borrowed from languages like French and Latin that did have a V sound. So now, V feels like it has this full status in English as a sound you can use in a lot of different contexts, but it wasn't always like that. We have a few relics of that left in the writing system. Also, with pairs like 'give' and 'gift,' where F and V sometimes make a pair. /f/ and /v/ are made with the lip and one part of the teeth, but you can actually make a fricative with both of the lips like /ɸ/ and /β/ if you sort of try to make /p/ but just give them a little more space, you can make /ɸ/ and /β/. This isn't found in English really, but it is found in other languages. They're found in Spanish to some degree. These sounds sound quite a lot like either /b/ or /v/ or either /p/ or /f/. Sometimes, the languages just use them as variants of sounds they already have, and they don't make them stars of like, 'We're gonna make this sound carry a lot of meaning in this language.' They're found, but they're often found as sort of, I dunno, I wanna say like werewolves. They only show up in certain contexts when there's a full moon."
58,44,Lauren,"A little bit like our Old English V, which only popped up in the middle of words towards the end of the -- and it wasn't everywhere all the time."
58,45,Gretchen,"Exactly. Sometimes, you have sounds that can show up in a language but not be particularly important for making entirely new words."
58,46,Lauren,"If we move our attention further back in the mouth rather than further forward, we end up at the sounds -- because there are more than one in English -- /θ/ and /ð/."
58,47,Gretchen,"These are the sounds like in 'bath' and 'bathe,' or in 'either' and 'ether.'"
58,48,Lauren,"Oh, that's a good pair."
58,49,Gretchen,Yeah. Or in 'wreath' and 'wreathe.'
58,50,Lauren,"We don't often pay attention to them because they get written in English with the same T-H combination, but they're actually two different sounds -- one involves vibration of the vocal cords, and one doesn't."
58,51,Gretchen,"This vocal cord vibration theme just keeps coming up because especially in English with the history of fricatives /bæθ/ and /bɛɪð/, /ɹiθ/ and /ɹið/, /bɹɛθ/ and /bɹið/ -- they were also sort of pairs where one of them had a vowel after them. That version of the T-H -- which there are two T-H sounds -- was between two vowels just like the F was between two vowels and became V and the /θ/ in between two vowels became /ð/, which is also getting that here's your vocal cords vibrating again because you're between two vowels. This is a thing that happens specifically in English fricatives, although it's not uncommon across other languages as well."
58,52,Lauren,I sometimes wonder if we would pay more attention to the difference between /θ/ and /ð/ if we had different symbols for them. English used to before the printing press ruined everything.
58,53,Gretchen,"I mean, Icelandic still has a symbol for the /ð/ sound, which is this circle with a line in a cross above it, which is called 'eth.' This is available in other languages. It's just not a thing that printing presses from continental Europe had. Because French doesn't have this sound. Dutch doesn't have this sound. That's where they were importing printing presses from. They didn't have a symbol for this sound, so they were like, 'Oh, I guess we could just do something else with it instead.'"
58,54,Lauren,"Whereas the English Runic system used to have 'thorn,' which looked like a little thorn on a branch and, I mean, meant 'thorn' as well but was used for this sound. It was an attempt to use Y to represent that really lazily in old printing which is why 'the olde tea shop' looks like 'ye olde tea shop.'"
58,55,Gretchen,"It was actually them just trying to pronounce 'the olde tea shop' and use a different letter for it. So, if you ever see that on a ren faire sign, you know what it is from now. The one that they ended up sticking with was using a T-H for both of them. There really would've been an argument to use T-H and D-H for them, it's just that the /ð/ sound is not super common in English even still because we didn't have a source like French bringing us a whole bunch of /ð/ words the way French brought us a bunch of V words. It's found in some words, but a lot of them you can tell which one it's gonna be based on context."
58,56,Lauren,"These two sounds are not particularly common across the world's languages. But the most prevalent fricative -- in fact, one of the most prevalent sounds that you'll find across different languages of the world is -- once again, moving a little bit further back in our mouths -- the sound /s/."
58,57,Gretchen,Yes. The glorious S.
58,58,Lauren,Satisfyingly common.
58,59,Gretchen,'Satisfyingly sneaky' I was hoping you were going to say.
58,60,Lauren,There is a high saturation of S. It's found in around 70% of the world's languages.
58,61,Gretchen,I have a fun story about the letter S versus the sound S.
58,62,Lauren,"Oh, yeah, that's always good to separate out the writing system and the sounds that are actually used."
58,63,Gretchen,"It's really messed up. The way that I know this is because when I was an undergraduate linguistics student with time on my hands and other linguistic student friends with times on their hands, we made a Scrabble set with International Phonetic Alphabet tiles."
58,64,Lauren,"Ooo! So, you make words, but instead of spelling them out, you pronounce them out using the International Phonetic Alphabet."
58,65,Gretchen,"Exactly. It's kind of complicated because you can't just take all the English alphabet letters and write their International Phonetic Alphabet version because the distribution of tiles in a Scrabble set is like you have a lot of Es, and you only have one Z, and you only have one Q, and stuff like this. You need to figure out what's really common and what's really rare and decide both how many of them to put in the game and also what point value to give them. This changes a lot of things. By the way, I do actually have -- one of the very first blog posts that I made on my blog was from a couple years earlier this list of IPA Scrabble frequencies. There's a tiny spreadsheet you can download that has the frequencies and how you can make your own game if you wanna get cardboard and draw on it and then put it on your existing Scrabble set. You can totally do this. Some people have and sent me photos, which is amazing. I have a link to how to do this for yourself if this is a thing you need in your life now. But playing IPA Scrabble is also a super interesting experience because almost the thing that was weird about it was not just what letters are surprisingly hard and they're rare -- that's how I learned that it's really hard to play 'the' in IPA Scrabble because it's a really high-value letter that isn't found in a ton of words -- but also, letters that you would expect would be easy are sometimes actually surprisingly hard. One of those is S."
58,66,Lauren,Okay. Because our letter S doesn't always represent us saying the sound /s/.
58,67,Gretchen,"Exactly. The letter S in the English orthography, sometimes it's combined with an H, but that makes a /ʃ/ sound. That's a different tile in IPA Scrabble. You have a /ʃ/ tile and you have a /s/ tile. This is in words like 'sea' -- okay, there's your S making an S sound -- but then in 'she,' you'd spell this in IPA Scrabble as a /ʃ/ plus an /i/."
58,68,Lauren,Because in English we use S-H to represent that /ʃ/ sound.
58,69,Gretchen,Right. There's a source of Ss that you can no longer play.
58,70,Lauren,"Oh, there's so many /ʃ/ words."
58,71,Gretchen,"Right! Sometimes, an S makes a /ʃ/ sound, and you don't even have an H there. A word like 'sure,' again, 'sir' -- well, that's a word in English, actually, but it's a different word."
58,72,Lauren,"You would have to have a very specific English accent to say, 'I am /sijʌ:/.'"
58,73,Gretchen,"Right. I mean, maybe there's an English accent that does this. The way we played IPA Scrabble for the rules because obviously it's hard to have an authority that's in charge of how anyone says is you had to pronounce the way you were spelling it as you put it on the board. If you pronounced it differently from what you were putting on the board, it was like, 'I don't think this word spells what you think it spells.' And that word had to be a valid pronunciation of the word in any dialect of English that anybody was aware of. Additionally, you have this other problem. It's not just the /ʃ/ problem with trying to play S in IPA Scrabble, which is a problem that I'm sure everyone finds completely relatable and common in your lives, but also you have a /z/ problem because there are actually a lot of words in English which are written with an S but where it's pronounced like a Z."
58,74,Lauren,"Oh my gosh, that's half of English plurals because we use the S in writing to represent a plural. It's 'one cat,' 'two cats,' so that's fine, but it's 'one dog,' 'two /dagz/.'"
58,75,Gretchen,Exactly. This has the really interesting side effect that the Z tile in IPA Scrabble is suddenly really easy and low value to play because you can just use it to pluralize things.
58,76,Lauren,Z is finally having its moment. It makes me really happy that this fricative is getting the attention that it deserves when you move away from writing.
58,77,Gretchen,"Again, words like 'dogs' but also like 'wise' or something like 'analyse,' which has two different spellings depending on whether you wanna spell it with a Z or an S, but the S spelling is no longer legitimate if you're playing in IPA Scrabble because it's actually pronounced with a Z both times."
58,78,Lauren,"Just a call back to moments ago, once again, a lot of those have arisen because /s/ was between two vowels and that turns on the voicing in your vocal cords."
58,79,Gretchen,"You have words in English like /hæʊs/ and /hæʊz/ which, again, it's a pair like 'breath' and 'breathe' where, even though they're both written the same way in modern-day English, one of them is the noun and one of them is the verb, and you can hear that in how the fricatives change. You can also hear that because I have Canadian raising in the vowels. That's beside the point."
58,80,Lauren,That's a whole other topic.
58,81,Gretchen,"That's another episode someday. So, S in English spelling can be /ʃ/. It can be /z/. It can also be the sound that's like the combination of those two things which is the furthest from S which is /ʒ/. This is a word like 'measure' or 'Asia,' 'leisure.' Here you have an S in the writing system that for various historical reasons has acquired both the /z/ attribute of being between two vowels where your vocal cords are now doing a thing and also the /ʃ/ attribute of another context in the word being before a /j/ sound, often, where it's become more like the /j/. It's gotten both of those things, and you have /mɛʒɹ̩/ and /liʒɹ̩/ and /ɛɪʒə/. Let me tell you, this is the highest value and most difficult card to play in IPA Scrabble is the /ʒ/ sound because it mostly shows up in English in either words that we've borrowed from other languages like 'genre' or 'rouge' or 'zhuzh' or words that have multiple syllables where it's arrived there for historical phonological reasons like 'measure' and 'leisure,' which at one point was /mɛʃɹ̩/ or /mɛsiɹ̩/ and gradually got smooshed together more and into a /ʒ/ sound."
58,82,Lauren,I love how deeply uncomfortable that sounded for you to say.
58,83,Gretchen,"It's so difficult! It sounds like I'm saying 'messier,' which probably if you say it fast is just like 'measure.'"
58,84,Lauren,It's just such an embedded part of the way English works to make these changes in the middle of words.
58,85,Gretchen,"/ʒ/ the IPA character tile becomes really difficult to play because it's found in this fairly limited context, but it is in English, and so you have to put it in your IPA Scrabble set. And /s/ which is often used to spell this whole set of words suddenly actually gets a little bit more difficult to play, even though it's still found in lots of words like 'sea' and 'sit' and tons of nice, short, Scrabble-icious words. But it's a bit harder than it used to be."
58,86,Lauren,"As a literate English speaker, I image there's a lot of just trying to undo what your brain perceives as writing and listening to the actual sounds that are happening."
58,87,Gretchen,"It gives you a ton of compassion for children learning how to read and write where they have to be told, 'No, I know we told you that S makes the /s/ sound, except in all of these words where it can make four other sounds.'"
58,88,Lauren,"Shall we visit a fricative that's not in English? There are many, and there are many ways that fricatives get used but English do not use them. It's always lovely to hear about other people's language speaking and language learning experiences with these. But let's visit Wales, and we'll visit Welsh."
58,89,Gretchen,"Okay, let's go to Wales. Staying on the British Isles but with a Celtic language."
58,90,Lauren,"Welsh has a sound /l/ like in English, but they also have a sound that's made at exactly the same place in the mouth, but instead of going /l/, you just -- well, first of all, you turn off the vibrations in your vocal folds, and then you make it like a fricative. It's written with a double L. A name like Llewellyn in Welsh would be /ɬuɛlɛn/."
58,91,Gretchen,"The fun thing is -- so I know a Welsh person who produces very nice /ɬ/s, and at one point I made some sort of joke about -- do you know the clothing chain known as L.L. Bean? They make sweaters and stuff."
58,92,Lauren,"Oh, yeah, I feel like it's a thing I have not encountered but have heard of."
58,93,Gretchen,"I don't know if I've been to any in Canada, but they're a thing I'm vaguely aware of. I was like, 'Oh, so does this mean that you pronounce 'L.L. Bean' as if it's Welsh?' And they actually had to pause and be like, 'Wait. I've always in my head just been pronouncing this store as /ɬəbin/."
58,94,Lauren,"Oh, no! Really? Amazing."
58,95,Gretchen,"And every time now -- if you're ever having a bad day, you can just go /ɬəbin/."
58,96,Lauren,/ɬəbin/. That is charming.
58,97,Gretchen,Isn't there a musician LL Cool J which I don't think my friends have heard of?
58,98,Lauren,"No, I think you mean /ɬ/ Cool Jay."
58,99,Gretchen,"Exactly. I made this joke with my friend's permission on Twitter, and somebody responded, 'Well, that's what happens when you talk to 'inte/ɬ/ectuals.''"
58,100,Lauren,"I will never look at a double L in English the same way ever again. Thank you so much, Gretchen."
58,101,Gretchen,"Thank my Welsh friend who prefers to remain anonymous but whose permission I did get to share this story. It's a fun sound. It's not only found in Welsh, but it is definitely one of the distinctive sounds in Welsh. It's just a really delightful fricative."
58,102,Lauren,Been a nice holiday.
58,103,Gretchen,Shall we head over to the European continent?
58,104,Lauren,Sounds great. Another lovely fricative which is -- we're been moving further and further back in the mouth as make these -- and so now we're at /x/.
58,105,Gretchen,"/x/ is fairly interesting because there's a couple sounds there. There's the sound that's produced with your tongue in the same position as you would use to make a K -- /x/. And then there's a sound that's a tiny bit further back that has the vibration of the uvula, which is the part in your throat that dangles down and vibrates when you scream in a cartoon."
58,106,Lauren,"That's officially how it's described, yes."
58,107,Gretchen,"You know, the screaming cartoon child mouth one. That's the technical definition. /x/, /χ/, which is a little bit further back in the throat -- and some languages will just treat both of those sounds as variations on the same thing. Some languages will have one or the other. There's probably some language that has both and differentiates between them as well, but there's both things going on there. A lot of the languages on the European continent have this /x/χ/ sound, especially the one that's a little bit further forward in the mouth. Actually, we didn't need to leave the British Isles because Scots and Scottish English has the /x/ sound as in /lax/, but also you see it in German -- the classic German /bax/ example that gets cited in language textbooks. One that doesn't get cited but is also still the same sound is the sound that J spells in Spanish as in 'jalapeño.'"
58,108,Lauren,"/xæləpɛɲʝo/. Ah, that's a fricative."
58,109,Gretchen,"That's a fricative, and it's the same fricative that's in the same position as a K, which gets written as X in the International Phonetic Alphabet. Sometimes, people think of that sound as a variant on H, whereas they think of the German or the Scottish sound as a variant on K, but they're actually both the same sound if you look at how people actually produce them."
58,110,Lauren,"That's so interesting. It ties into another area of phonetics. We've been talking a lot about the way we produce sounds, but there's also really interesting things that happened when we look at how people perceive specific sounds in the International Phonetic Alphabet, and how that differs depending on the language that's being spoken or the people who are doing the speaking."
58,111,Gretchen,"The sound that's represented with an X, the /x/ sound, it shows up in a lot of ideas that people have about languages. I think it's really leftover World War II propaganda, honestly, because German gets stereotyped as like, 'Oh, it's got this sound. It's very hard in the back of the throat,' but also this sound is in Dutch and Spanish, and people aren't saying this like, 'Oh, it's so harsh,' about Dutch because they were our allies in the Second World War. Dutch actually has more of them because Dutch has this K-like sound that's where your vocal cords aren't vibrating, but it also has a /g/-like sound, where your vocal cords are vibrating, /ɣ/. /ɣ/ -- I don't know if I can do it well. But if anything, Dutch has more of these, and yet no one is saying this about the Dutch."
58,112,Lauren,That's what I always find really interesting about the values that we attach to these sounds that are produced similarly. It's just the context that they're produced in really varies our attitudes toward them.
58,113,Gretchen,"Arabic has some of these sounds that are in the back of the throat. The /x/ sound as well as a few others. But also, so does French. People aren't saying that French sounds harsh and guttural in the same sorts of ways. I hate the word 'guttural' as applied to a language. It doesn't have a linguistically defined meaning. It generally just means 'I'm going to be kind of racist now.'"
58,114,Lauren,I should say that I specifically find the way people ascribe values interesting. I find the types of values that get ascribed very tedious. Learning about how sounds work mechanistically in the International Phonetic Alphabet is a really good way to start trying to step back from those knee-jerk reactions you have.
58,115,Gretchen,Exactly. The other fun fact about the fricative that's in this sort of C/K/G position is that it's sort of a ghost sound in English.
58,116,Lauren,Okay. Because of the 'loch' situation in Scottish English?
58,117,Gretchen,"Not only that, but this is actually the sound that in English used to be represented with the sequence G-H. This is in words like 'knight' or 'laugh' or 'enough' or also a certain person's surname who you may have met."
58,118,Lauren,"Oh, yeah, your surname, Gretchen McCullough."
58,119,Gretchen,"Thank you. Sometimes it gets represented as G-H. There are other people who have the O-U-G-H spelling of my surname. Mine is spelled O-C-H. Because in modern English it often gets approximated with C-H or maybe K-H. But historically in English it was written with G-H. This is why you get G-H making all of these different sounds in English because in words like 'laugh' and 'cough' it got made into a different fricative. So, /lax/ and /kax/ became 'laugh' and 'cough.'"
58,120,Lauren,And your name became /məkələf/.
58,121,Gretchen,[Laughs] If only. I could have been /məkələf/.
58,122,Lauren,"So, that didn't happen. It went through other paths as well."
58,123,Gretchen,"And sometimes it just went to zero. You have like 'through' and 'though' and 'knight' and 'light,' and that just became silent and maybe affected the sound of the vowel next to it. Then in some cases it became like a K like in the way I say my name /məkələk/ or in modern-day Anglicisations of /lak/ or /bak/ which is how you get a lot of English speakers saying those words if they're not super comfortable with that particular fricative. They'll pick the stop that's in the same position -- the K. It's this very interesting sort of woo here's this ghost that was there in English, and it still left its ghostly footprints in various parts of the language."
58,124,Lauren,Left us little traces.
58,125,Gretchen,"Except, incidentally, for the word 'ghost,' which was never actually pronounced like that. The H got added I think because of some early printers."
58,126,Lauren,"We are big fans of printing as a technology. We haven't got a lot of happy things to say about it in this episode, but I don't wanna drive that point home too hard. While we are talking about ghosts, shall we finish our tour on H -- /h/?"
58,127,Gretchen,/h/.
58,128,Lauren,/h/.
58,129,Gretchen,"Yeah, there are other fricatives, especially in between /x/ and /h/."
58,130,Lauren,Various places we've visited.
58,131,Gretchen,But /h/ is /ɛɪt͡ʃ/ or /hɛɪt͡ʃ/ depending on while English you speak. I honestly think /hɛɪt͡ʃ/ is more logical -- I just didn't grow up with it -- because it actually has the name of the sound in it. This one is interesting in English because it's also super hard to play in IPA Scrabble.
58,132,Lauren,Because words that we think have H in them often don't pronounce the H.
58,133,Gretchen,"Right. First of all, sometimes H is silent, and also, H is sometimes used like a modifier character for other sounds."
58,134,Lauren,Yes.
58,135,Gretchen,"You use it sometimes to modify vowels, like /a/ and /u/ and O. You might write those with an H to express that, yeah, I'm just trying to write this vowel -- here's this H that I've tacked on. You also use it as a modifier character for consonants. You can have T-H and S-H, like we've already talked about; you can have C-H. And all of this stuff you can no longer do if you're playing IPA Scrabble. You can't use it as a modifier. What that means is that you also can't play it at the end of a word."
58,136,Lauren,"Yes, it only turns up at the start of words, really, if it turns up at all in English."
58,137,Gretchen,And occasionally in the middle. You'll get words like 'ahead.'
58,138,Lauren,True. I got 'ahead' of myself there.
58,139,Gretchen,"But, yeah, you don't see it at the end of a syllable, which means you don't see it at the end of a word. It means if you're trying to make this branching Scrabble-style combination of words, once you see an H, you've created a dead end for yourself if you can't then attach the end of a word onto it. This isn't true in other languages."
58,140,Lauren,"Oh, yeah. That's true. That is pretty much exactly the reason that we have names like 'Sarah' and 'Hannah' that are often spelt with a H. They don't have to be because those sounds aren't pronounced in English -- those Hs at the end of words. But I think it's because names like that are often borrowed from Hebrew where those final Hs are pronounced. We retained the spelling convention without retaining the pronunciation."
58,141,Gretchen,"When I was studying Arabic, there are totally still words in Arabic that have a final H that can be pronounced. You could say /hænʌh/ or /sɑɹʌh/, which might be a way to say it in another language but is not how they're conventionally said in English because even producing that H at the end of a word can be a challenge for English speakers -- or hearing it can be a challenge for English speakers."
58,142,Lauren,"It's possibly not that surprising that we don't have H at the end of words. In fact, even at the start of words, we don't pronounce it a lot even if it might've been there historically in words like 'hour.' That's why we say 'an hour' because we treat it as though it starts with a vowel, and why North Americans often says /ɹ̩bz/ instead of /hɹ̩bz/. It's an easy sound to misplace because there's not a whole lot going on. As a fricative, it's not the most fricative of fricatives. There's not a lot of frication happening there."
58,143,Gretchen,"And H is interesting because it's actually produced with the vocal cords themselves constricting to make a fricative. The only thing that you're doing is /h/ with your vocal cords. There aren't a lot of nerve endings in the vocal cords, so I'm always like, 'I'm doing this, and I can make it because I'm thinking of the sound, but I don't feel like I'm actually feeling it' because your vocal cords don't have a lot of nerve endings. I think it would actually drive you up the wall to be feeling this constant, like, clash in your throat every single time you were engaging them in the middle of a word. It's probably good that they don't have a lot of nerve endings. But I feel like, unlike your lips where you can put them in a spot and feel them there, the further you go back in the throat, the further you start feeling what you're doing with being there."
58,144,Lauren,"When we were researching this episode, we actually looked at the International Phonetic Alphabet from a bunch of versions of it because the International Phonetic Association regularly meet and assess the state of research and update the International Phonetic Alphabet. H has been on this little journey where, in 2005, /h/ shared a row with the fricatives, who we've met a bunch of, but also with sounds like /j/ and /w/ that are less about fricatives."
58,145,Gretchen,"/j/ and /w/ have a bit of a bigger syllable. They have a little bit of constriction in the mouth, but they have a bit of a bigger opening and a little bit less friction. I can kind of see how somebody could say, 'Well, maybe, what if we treated H as sometimes it seems to show up like the /j/ or /w/ and has a bit of less friction,' but then they restored it only being a fricative box, possibly because it's confusing to have one symbol occupy two boxes because they don't really do that very much elsewhere in the IPA."
58,146,Lauren,"It's been on this little journey. It is currently a fully-fledged fricative, but it has been on an interesting little journey I think because there's less movement happening throughout the vocal tract while you're saying it."
58,147,Gretchen,"It's also a bit harder to see it and feel what's going on. Fricatives have a special spot for me because they were one of the first things that I learned about when I was in high school, and I was teaching myself linguistics, and I was trying to get access to books and stuff. I remember sitting down and being like, 'Okay, here's this description of like' -- there're actually words that describe all the different things that your mouth is doing when you're making all these different sounds, and you can describe what place is undergoing the constriction, and you can describe how much constriction you're doing, and you have this thing in the vocal cords and all of these combinations. I remember when I was probably about 15, and I was trying to wrap my head around this whole process, I was on a car trip with my mom, and I was explaining to her like, 'Here's what's going on in your mouth. And here's what this is. And here's what this is.' And she was listening very appreciatively as parents sometimes do."
58,148,Lauren,You have a bit of a captive audience on a car trip.
58,149,Gretchen,"You have a captive audience on a car trip, and I was like, 'Here's the thing.' Ever since then, I think she retained that bit, and she especially retained the word 'fricative' because she just really liked the sound of the word 'fricative.'"
58,150,Lauren,It's a fun word to say.
58,151,Gretchen,"She was like, 'It sounds like a swear word. You can just be like, 'Fricative! I don't wanna do this!'' [Laughs] Every so often she would -- when I kept doing linguistics at university -- she'd be like, 'How are the fricatives doing? What's going on with the fricatives now?'"
58,152,Lauren,Bless.
58,153,Gretchen,I feel like our new fricative-themed merch is somewhat inspired by my mom's absolute delight in the word 'fricative.'
58,154,Lauren,"We thought we'd take some inspiration from Gretchen's mom who found it mildly expletive in its energy. Whether you say it in surprise or joy or frustration, we have made a range of 'What the fricative' merch for you."
58,155,Gretchen,"Yes, you can put 'What the fricative' on a mug or a t-shirt, a notebook, various other items and make people think, 'Is this person swearing?' And then you have an excuse to tell them some linguistics."
58,156,Lauren,You can share your favourite fricative story with people who appreciate your merch or on social media. [Music]

59,1,Gretchen,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics! I'm Gretchen McCulloch."
59,2,Lauren,"I'm Lauren Gawne. Today we're getting enthusiastic about whether you're getting enthusiastic about theory of mind. But first, our most recent bonus episode is on translation in fiction -- mostly translating between human languages and non-human languages but all kinds of translation."
59,3,Gretchen,You can get access to this translation episode about some books we've been reading recently and 50 other bonus episodes by becoming a patron at patreon.com/lingthusiasm. Here's a bit of a preview into the books we talked about.
59,4,Lauren,"We talked about Semiosis by Sue Burke, and A Memory Called Empire by Arkady Martine, as well as The Devil Comes Courting by Courtney Milan. And, Gretchen, you have read Native Tongue by Suzette Haden Elgin."
59,5,Gretchen,"I have finally gotten around to reading Native Tongue, which has been much recommended to me."
59,6,Lauren,A classic piece of linguistic sci-fi.
59,7,Gretchen,"You don't have to have read any of these books beforehand. We don't provide plot spoilers, although we'll talk about some of the things in the setting. It's fun whether you've read any of them or not at all. You might end up with some new things to read."
59,8,Lauren,You can get access to that episode and all of our bonus episodes at patreon.com/lingthusiasm.[Music]
59,9,Lauren,"Gretchen, I'm gonna run an experiment on you."
59,10,Gretchen,"Okay, I like experiments."
59,11,Lauren,"Excellent. This one involves a lot of a set up, but it's great because you can do it. If you are listening along, you can also do the experiment along with us."
59,12,Gretchen,Great! What's our set up?
59,13,Lauren,We have Sally and Anne.
59,14,Gretchen,Okay.
59,15,Lauren,Sally has a basket. Anne has a box. Sally has a marble -- Sally with the basket -- and she puts her marble into the basket. Then she goes out for a walk. Sally's not here. But we've got a basket with a marble in it.
59,16,Gretchen,Sally's not here. We've got her basket with the marble in it. Okay.
59,17,Lauren,"We've got a box, and Anne is still there. Anne takes the marble out of the basket and puts it in the box."
59,18,Gretchen,"So, now we've got a marble in a box."
59,19,Lauren,"We've got the marble in the box. Sally comes back, and Sally wants to play with the marble. Where is Sally going to go to get her marble?"
59,20,Gretchen,"I'm going to deduce -- based on the fact that when Sally left the room, she left the marble in the basket -- she probably still thinks the marble is in the basket because she'd have no reason to assume that things would've changed, and so she's gonna try the basket first because she doesn't know that Anne has moved it."
59,21,Lauren,That is a perfectly reasonable deduction to make. You are a veritable Sherlock Holmes.
59,22,Gretchen,Thank you. Did I pass the test?
59,23,Lauren,You did. You completed what is known as the 'theory of mind test' because you kept track of what you knew about the situation and what Sally knew about the situation and all the sneakiness that Anne had perpetrated with the marble.
59,24,Gretchen,"But presumably at some period earlier in my life, when I was a very young child, I might not have passed this test."
59,25,Lauren,The ability to correctly articulate what you know about Sally's likely chances of going to the basket or the box really doesn't settle into being reliable until 3 or 4 years old -- actually being able to articulate what you know about the state of other people's thinking.
59,26,Gretchen,"Which feels kind of late because 2-year-olds, 3-year-olds already have quite a bit of language in most cases, and yet this later reasoning about mental states and what different people know about different things comes along later."
59,27,Lauren,"That's what the theory of mind test seems to indicate. It is a bit more complex than this. This is something that was run for the first time 30 or 40 years ago. There's been more work that's tried to do versions that don't involve language; they just involve looking. They show that toddlers, 15 months old, are actually maybe better at paying attention to the fact that the marble is in one place or another and what Sally might know a little bit better than they can articulate. It's something about being able to put it into words that seems to be one of the challenges that takes until, as you say, well into language acquisition to be able to do this task consistently."
59,28,Gretchen,"This task feels like something that some experimenter set up in a lab, and maybe they had puppets, or maybe they had two different experimenters, and these props feel very psychology-experiment-prop style to me."
59,29,Lauren,"What do we have in the props department, yeah."
59,30,Gretchen,"It's funny. I was reading a different paper about these types of experiments, and there are other ways you can test for theory of mind. One of my either favourite or least favourite, depending on this, is -- oh, shall I do it on you?"
59,31,Lauren,"Okay, yes."
59,32,Gretchen,I have a box. It's a small cardboard box. The outside says 'Kinder Chocolate Bars' -- chocolate things.
59,33,Lauren,Great. I'm very compelled by this box.
59,34,Gretchen,"We have our friend Gavagai, who is also in the room and sees this box with the chocolates on it. Gavagai is called out, suddenly, to leave to go do something else."
59,35,Lauren,"Bye, Gav."
59,36,Gretchen,"I open this box, and I show you that inside is not, in fact, chocolates, but it is pencils -- coloured pencils."
59,37,Lauren,"Okay, I was gonna say that's a bit of a disappointment, but it's something of a disappointment to me."
59,38,Gretchen,"They're coloured pencils, which is something more exciting than graphite pencils. But still, they're not chocolates. Then I close the box up again, and it looks like it's closed. Then our friend Gav comes back in the room."
59,39,Lauren,"Hi, Gav."
59,40,Gretchen,What does Gav think is in the box?
59,41,Lauren,"Well, I know that it's pencils. But Gav wasn't here when I saw that it was pencils. Gav still thinks it's chocolates, and boy, are they in for a disappointment."
59,42,Gretchen,"Yes, they are. You can do this about location of item, which is the Sally-Anne test, which is about location, or you can do it about identity of item -- what's in it."
59,43,Lauren,"I have a colleague who's done the theory of mind task with little stones instead of a marble, but then there's a whole other twist where the stones end up being those little nuggets of chocolate that look like stones. I just feel like I would be confused by that point about who knows what about the state or location of this rock chocolate situation."
59,44,Gretchen,"I remember I loved those stones as a child because it felt like you were gonna break a tooth on them, and then you would eat them."
59,45,Lauren,You could definitely do some fun false belief with someone about me eating dirt.
59,46,Gretchen,"There's also a fun one in this study where they found -- and I don't know where they got this object because I have not seen an object like this -- they have this little toy that looks like a race car, like one of those cars that you 'vroom vroom' on the table. But it turns out when you press a button on it, it turns into a pen. A pen-thing pops out. They're trying to see does this person think it's a race car, do they think it's a pen. Somebody's really going around in toy shops being like, 'Okay, what here could be deceptive?'"
59,47,Lauren,"Keeping track of people's knowledge states, as we've said, is something that takes a little bit of effort. Not all animals can necessarily do it. In fact, when we find animals that are really good at this, people get really excited. There are animals that are closely related to humans, like chimps seem pretty good at this. You can basically do a version of the location of an object thing, and the chimps are all over it. Also, ravens are really good at conceptualising where someone might be and what they might be doing. It's one of those skills that isn't just like -- well, first of all, you get theory of mind and a bunch of other things, and then you get language. It's not just an ingredient in the language cake. It's just one of many skills that humans and animals closely related to humans seem to have but also is scattered throughout the animal kingdom."
59,48,Gretchen,"Corvids are pretty smart, I guess. They can recognise people, so maybe they can also -- if you feed them, they'll become your friends."
59,49,Lauren,"We've run a very classic theory of mind experiment at the top of this episode, but as we suggested, people have been pulling apart exactly what theory of mind is and how different people do different elements of it. It seems to be this complicated cluster of features around attention, attention-tracking, false belief, mental states, and being able to do all of this is part of being able to do the social element of language."
59,50,Gretchen,"Because when you're talking about language, you're describing what other people have done. You're thinking like, 'Okay, why did this person behave this weird way this time?', or 'Why did this person do this thing to me?', 'Why can't I get this?' You're trying to figure out, well, it's because this other person wants this thing even though that's not what I want. Or it's because this other person knows this thing even though it's not what I know."
59,51,Lauren,"Even just the process of asking a question, like, using language to interact with someone to try and get to an end goal and whether or not they are likely to have the right information that I need to get this question answered. Theory of mind is the having really good foundations on the house of language, and it's part of why I'm always very zen when people talk about computers taking over the ability to do language. It's like, well, first of all, a computer has to be able to keep track of their best guess of the knowledge state of everyone else in the interaction, and that's not necessarily the same kind of programming task as figuring out sounds or morphemes or syntactic structures."
59,52,Gretchen,"It's interesting because it is a theory -- not like the theory of gravity where scientists have hypothesised that minds might exist -- but in the sense that, whenever we're interacting with the world, we're hypothesising that the people around us have intention behind what they're doing, and they're doing stuff for reasons. I have to hypothesise that you, Lauren, have a mind because I don't actually have direct evidence that you have a mind. Maybe you have actually been Lauren-bot this entire time!"
59,53,Lauren,"True, true. I am operating under the same premise. I have my own theory. It's not a shared theory, necessarily. We all have this internal idea that the people we're interacting with in conversation are also doing the same mental calculation that we are."
59,54,Gretchen,"I remember having this realisation that people have other mental states, and maybe they conceive of the world dramatically differently from how I do. Maybe this thing that I see that I call 'red' isn't actually what someone else is seeing even though they also call it 'red.' I remember having this philosophical realisation when I was about 12 or so, and thinking, 'How do we know anything that we're seeing things.' And yet, even though I don't have empirical evidence that you aren't just an extremely sophisticated automaton -- I mean, I do have a lot of empirical evidence, actually, because automatons aren't that good yet -- but we still manage to interact with people. We still manage to operate under a working theory that people do have minds and they are interactable with."
59,55,Lauren,"People have drawn a link between this kind of cognitive foundation and the need for language by looking at the way early human ancestors learnt to socialise with each other. Instead of having small packs of humans, you ended up getting these larger and larger groups. Once you have these larger groups, you have to have some way of maintaining social cohesion that's not just small-group dominance. Robin Dunbar is probably one the most famous proponents of this idea that language is a way of maintaining social cohesion and that you can keep a happy social relationship with more people essentially through gossip -- gossip being one of the mechanisms that helped generate the need for language."
59,56,Gretchen,"I mean, it's useful to know can you trust this person because they were trustworthy last time or have they been going around and doing things that are not trustworthy or is this someone that someone else is willing to vouch for. There's lots of reasons why language can help with cooperation."
59,57,Lauren,"In the absence of being able to time travel, I quite like this theory of one of the ways that humans came to use language."
59,58,Gretchen,"I've actually been thinking about Robin Dunbar's theories for a different reason. Because he has this very famous 150-size social group number, which is the size of a lot of villages or small communities or small companies or small conferences. It's the magic number for that kind of community. But also, there's this other number that Dunbar and colleagues have also researched, which is four. That's the number of people that conversations tend to max out at before they start splitting into smaller conversations."
59,59,Lauren,"Ah, this makes a lot of sense when I think about small group chat at parties and the ebb and flow of when people join or leave conversations. I think that must also explain why trying to have all of your friends in one big video chat room at an online party is really stressful."
59,60,Gretchen,"Exactly. This also shows up in fiction. It shows up in plays. It shows up in movies that people tend to max out at four conversation participants. The reason for this has to do with theory of mind, which is that we find it too cognitively exhausting to keep track of the mental states of too many people."
59,61,Lauren,In a specific conversation.
59,62,Gretchen,"At once, yeah."
59,63,Lauren,"So, I can vaguely keep track of, like, 200, 150 people in my social village, but in terms of the moment-to-moment what-do-you-know-about-the-story-I'm-telling, three or four people is enough for me to keep track of."
59,64,Gretchen,"There's a really interesting test of this which is that Dunbar and colleagues did an experiment where they asked people to talk about an absent third party and speculate about that absent third party's mental states. When people were instructed to use that for their conversation, they tended to form one smaller conversational grouping, so maximum of three instead of maximum of four, when they were just asked to talk about what the absent third parties were doing but not what they were thinking."
59,65,Lauren,I'm deeply fascinated by -- this is experiment is 'Please come into this lab and gossip.'
59,66,Gretchen,"Right. I don't remember exactly how they set it up, but yeah, something about the maximum number of mental states that you can conceive of without getting too tired is around five, but that means four people because you're also keeping track of, like, between you and me, we have three mental states. I'm thinking about me, I'm thinking about you, and then I'm also thinking about what you're thinking about me."
59,67,Lauren,This is why the language that we use to talk about internal mental states does particularly interesting things in grammar. You begin to see theory of mind affect the way that we do grammar because verbs that express internal mental states act a bit differently to other verbs.
59,68,Gretchen,"English actually has this interesting grammatical distinction between how we talk about mental state verbs versus action verbs in the present tense. We say something like, 'I know,' 'I like,' 'I understand,' 'I enjoy,' 'I fear,' but for action verbs, we're more likely to say something like, 'I am running,' 'I am walking,' 'I am talking.'"
59,69,Lauren,"Oh, yeah, 'I walk,' implies an 'I walk every day' habit thing."
59,70,Gretchen,"Right. Whereas 'I know' doesn't imply 'I know every day.' There's just this subtle distinction between how we talk about verbs in the present. In the past, we don't do this. You can say 'I liked' and 'I walked,' and that's the same, but in the present, we have this interesting distinction that's made in English that isn't necessarily made in other languages."
59,71,Lauren,"That only really works for first person in English. It's a bit weird to say this about other people, especially the person who you're talking to."
59,72,Gretchen,"It's another thing that's weird about verbs about mental states where it's sort of weird for me to be like, 'Lauren, you like cake.' I mean, I guess --"
59,73,Lauren,"I mean, you definitely have enough evidence to support that as a viable statement. I think in the context of us interacting, it would be fine, but it would very weird to say it to someone who you didn't have that knowledge for."
59,74,Gretchen,"If I just go up to someone in a coffee shop who's eating cake and say, 'You like cake,' it'd be like, 'Excuse me, but who invited your opinion here?'"
59,75,Lauren,"I think this is one of the things I've had to learn in teaching over the years is it's very easy for me to be like, 'Well, you know this because we covered it in class last week.' I just assume that everything we covered in class is completely absorbed into your knowledge state."
59,76,Gretchen,"You mean your students don't have perfect downloads of every single, you know, audio file of your voice?"
59,77,Lauren,In much the same way that we don't assume that people have absorbed every single fact from Lingthusiasm when we bring them up a couple of years later.
59,78,Gretchen,"Absolutely. You don't retain this. It's easy to be like, 'I've told you once,' and like, 'Yeah, that was years ago, I don't remember everything that happened to me years ago.'"
59,79,Lauren,It's why you end up finding a lot of question forms for second person in verb paradigms when you're trying to do this elicitation because it's much more comfortable for people to reframe what you've said as a question.
59,80,Gretchen,"I think when we're used to doing this decontextualised form of grammar as linguists, we're like, 'Oh, yeah, okay, I can make a verb paradigm: I like; you like; he/she likes; we like; you-plural like; they like.' Yeah, fine, I can just make this little paradigm for me. But the social context in which you would use each of these forms is actually really different."
59,81,Lauren,"I mean, now that we've said that I can definitely think of contexts where it would be fine to say it in English with a direct 'You like' or 'You know.' I think there're definitely where it would be safe to say it to a child that you are very close to like, 'I know you like toast. We ate toast for breakfast yesterday.' Lo and behold, they like toast. They just need to be reminded of that."
59,82,Gretchen,"But even there you were like, 'I know you like toast,' which is sort of not quite as committed to the statement as 'You like toast.' Or if you wanna say to a dog or something like, 'You want your dinner? Yes, I know you want your dinner. You're gonna have your dinner. Here we go.' But it's, I think, to say to an adult -- I mean, maybe if I walk in on you in your office, and I'm like, 'Oh, you're busy. I'll come back later.' Or like, 'Oh, you're reading. You're on the phone. I'll come back later.' There're certainly contexts in which you could do it, but you have to do a lot more contextual set up."
59,83,Lauren,I love how much set up you had to do to get to that as a valid way of using an internal state verb directly at someone.
59,84,Gretchen,"Whereas if I say, 'Yeah, I know. I like cake.' This doesn't require any set up. This is just the unmarked thing to do."
59,85,Lauren,This is why we separate out these verbs about internal mental states or 'psych verbs' as they're sometimes called and look at them separately to other verbs in English. Because talking about someone else's mental state changes the way that we can use them in grammar.
59,86,Gretchen,"Some psych verbs come in pairs. You can say 'I like cake' or 'Cake pleases me.' Or 'I fear dogs,' 'Dogs frighten me.' In both cases, you're having the same relationship between the two entities, but the verb flips, which you don't always see with actions. Sometimes you see it with actions like 'I buy this from you,' 'You sell it to me.' But it seems to be one of the things that happens with internal mental state verbs."
59,87,Lauren,They also tend to have more variation across languages and across cultures as to how you can use them.
59,88,Gretchen,"Yeah. There's a really interesting and subtle example of this in English and Spanish where in English it's less common to say something like 'You understand' with the meaning of 'I infer you understand based on the evidence of you seeming to understand.' Whereas in Spanish, you have a verb that seems like it should correspond to English 'understand,' but it is reasonable to use that verb to mean 'I infer you understand because you're asking really good questions' or 'I infer you understand because you are making noises of comprehension and you're nodding and so on.' It's reasonable to say to someone 'You understand' with the meaning, like, 'It seems to me that you understand' or 'I observe you to be understanding.'"
59,89,Lauren,"That is a subtle but important meaning distinction, I feel."
59,90,Gretchen,"I heard this anecdote from a linguist who -- I don't remember which linguist anymore -- who said that they'd told this to somebody -- an English speaker and a Spanish speaker who were in a marriage together -- and they both spoke each other's languages, but they didn't have an understanding that this was actually a pragmatic difference between them. Sometimes, they would get in fights by like, 'What do you mean you say I understand? You don't know what's going on in my internal mental state. You're just assuming what I know.' Which was actually a systematic pragmatic difference in how the languages use those particular mental state verbs rather than a case of just not understanding between the partners."
59,91,Lauren,"That is amazing. The thing I find really interesting about that anecdote is that the distinction between the two forms of 'understand' was really implicit between the two languages. I'm really interested in those grammatical features where knowledge state becomes very overt. That's essentially what motivated me to study how we grammatically track source of information, which is the area of evidentiality. We had a whole episode on that that I will not assume you've listened to, and I will not assume you remember anything from, but essentially, evidentiality is used to keep track of, depending on the language, whether you know something because you saw it or because someone else told you about it or maybe you're not entirely certain about it. This is marked as a feature of the grammar rather just being implicit or optional."
59,92,Gretchen,"In English, you have the option of saying something like, 'It's raining,' 'I can see that it's raining,' 'I can guess that it's raining because I can hear the rain drops,' or because someone's walked in, and their shoulders and umbrella are all soaking wet. You can say all of those things to indicate the source of your knowledge, but you don't have to. You could just say 'It's raining' and let someone else figure out how you came to know that information."
59,93,Lauren,"Whereas if we look at a language like Yolmo in Nepal that I've worked with, you can actually see someone's knowledge state changing throughout the story that they're telling because maybe they start with talking about something in a way where they're not certain if this cake is going to be delicious, and then they talk about how someone told them it's going to be delicious, and then finally, they have direct sensory evidence of how delicious the cake is. You see how the knowledge about the cake being delicious is really clearly marked by the grammatical choices that they have to make throughout the story. It means that I can keep track of someone else's source of evidence in a way that's more direct than in English. It means that people are more attentive to mine as well."
59,94,Gretchen,"So, if you wanna say something like, 'I infer that you understand,' you would be doing that with the evidential marker. Or 'You told me that you understood this yesterday, so why don't you understand it today,' then you'd have a lot of ways of marking the differences between those internal mental states."
59,95,Lauren,"Yes. And those internal state experiences of if someone's unwell or if someone's hungry, I have to mark them differently if I don't have any direct visual evidence. If you're unwell, and you're shaking and feverish, I can say that I can see you're unwell. But if you're unwell in a way that I can't see, I have to use other grammatical ways of marking it. How you interact with other people's internal states varies because sometimes you don't have access to a direct source of evidence for it."
59,96,Gretchen,"I feel like I'm just picturing those little cartoons you get in language learning textbooks where they have test very stereotyped representations of common illnesses that don't have obvious physical things. Like, 'I have a headache' would be like a person holding their head in great distress or with a hot water bottle on their head, and you're like, 'I don't put a hot water bottle on my head when I have a headache.' Or like somebody who has a thermometer sticking out of their mouth or something to indicate these sort of things that aren't really easily visually represented."
59,97,Lauren,"It's because figuring out someone else's internal state is actually a really complicated cognitive task that we do, and we fall back on these tropes to help us navigate that."
59,98,Gretchen,"I guess same for teaching other types of mental state verbs, you know, 'know' or 'understand' or 'like' or something. You have these maybe very stereotyped or symbolic representations. If you have someone with a heart or something, maybe they're liking it or loving it. But it's difficult to do a picture of 'I know,' 'I understand.' Not everything is easily visualisable."
59,99,Lauren,You talked earlier about how it was a revelation for you at some point that maybe we can't really know what's happening in other people's minds. There is a lot of cultural variation as to how much people are willing to feel like they're able to intuit the internal states of other people -- so much so that there's a whole area of anthropology that looks at this idea of cultures where it's really prevalent to assume that you can't know someone else's internal state. That's the starting point for building social interactions.
59,100,Gretchen,"This is the inverse of the Spanish thing where it's like, 'Yeah, I can infer your mental state.' This is like, 'Nobody can really know what anyone else is thinking at all.'"
59,101,Lauren,It's a cultural assumption and starting point for building conversations and interactions that I'm gonna assume that I can't know what your internal state is. I can only make reference to it by very overtly flagging that I don't know that. I might talk about your actions rather than my assumptions about the thoughts behind those actions.
59,102,Gretchen,"So, what does it look like in practice if someone's operating under the assumption that you can never really understand what's going on in someone else's mind?"
59,103,Lauren,"A lot of the anthropologists who work in this area tend to look at the domain of gossip. I like to think of it in terms of -- it just means that you're unlikely to have gossip that goes along the lines of 'What were they even thinking?' Instead, your gossip is more about the concrete actions of people rather than rationalising their mental state while they were doing those things."
59,104,Gretchen,"Okay. So, not like, 'This person had good intentions, but this thing didn't work,' or 'This person never cares about other people's feelings, and so therefore...,' but it's more like, 'Oh, this person did this thing -- ate my cake.'"
59,105,Lauren,"Yeah. I mean, assuming someone has good intentions is something that presumes that you can know what's inside someone else's mind."
59,106,Gretchen,"It's like, 'This person ate my cake. I don't care why they did it, but that's what happened.'"
59,107,Lauren,"That tends to be more of the focus that gets talked about or that people might come upon by using strategies like grammatical evidentiality as a like, 'You can't know what's in my mind, so let me tell you that I know that it's raining because someone said or because I saw it.' Like, 'Let me do that work for you of telling you my state of knowledge rather than you trying to guess something that you can't guess.'"
59,108,Gretchen,"So, it's not necessarily a thing of 'We're not talking about mental states,' but the person is the ultimate authority on their own mental state."
59,109,Lauren,Yeah. I think this area of opacity of mind is looking at commonalities between what are actually very different ways of approaching understanding people's internal states because perhaps culturally we've just gone with the assumption that everyone thinks about social interaction the way we do and that maybe there's a lot of variation there.
59,110,Gretchen,"Lauren, are you saying we have bad theory of mind about theory of mind?"
59,111,Lauren,Potentially. But I think learning about theory of mind as a bedrock and then opacity of mind as the way people approach this bedrock has made me more appreciative of keeping track of what people might know or not making assumptions about what people bring to any particular interaction. I really appreciate knowing about theory of mind for that reason.
59,112,Gretchen,"I think practicing figuring out, okay, what are some possible mental states here, what might be going on. This is one of the things I really like about fiction, especially, reading books is you do get to be behind someone else's eyes and thinking about what they're doing and why they're doing it even if their reasons for doing something are really different from what I would think. I find filmed stuff, unless there's a lot of voiceover -- I love voiceover because you can get into someone's mind. Not everyone's a fan of voiceover, but I love it because it gives you that internal mental state. I don't just wanna look at someone's face and think, 'Oh, this is what they're thinking.' I wanna be behind their eyes and thinking, 'Oh, they actually think this is a good idea. Okay. Well, I'm along for this ride now.'"
59,113,Lauren,I think fiction is a really great philosophical experiment. It's one of the reasons I really find sci-fi to be interesting is because it can push the limits of what another mind is or what another mental state is to be thinking in. One thing we didn't get to in the bonus episode about Arkady Martine's Memory Called Empire is that there are people who have the capacity to take on the entire previous knowledge state of someone else. I just am like what would an evidential marking system be like for a person who has multiple consciousnesses worth of evidence for a statement.
59,114,Gretchen,"Like, 'I know this because my original consciousness knew this' or 'I know this because the consciousness that I got added to mine later in life knows this.' Oh, man."
59,115,Lauren,There're just so many layers of potential knowledge state there. That's the kind of sci-fi that lets me bring my linguist brain to problems of consciousness.
59,116,Gretchen,"I've been thinking about this from a practical level as well recently which is what's the point of having a conference compared to just reading some blog posts or something about the same topic. I think it's about that conferences create a state of shared knowledge among their participants. You know that everyone else was also at the same talks or in the same environment or is interested in the same topic, and so it gives you springboards for having conversations about topics of mutual interest rather than just 'I've acquired this information.' It's 'I've acquired this information in a social context where I've also acquired a bunch of people to talk with about it.'"
59,117,Lauren,"I've never quite thought of conferences in that way, but that is a very wholesome, linguist-brain way to approach it."
59,118,Gretchen,"Well, it's partly why digital conferences can be unsatisfying because if you don't know who else is in the audience and you don't have any way of spending time with them then you don't get to have that shared mental state with the fellow conference participants. You're just receiving the knowledge in a way that you could do without the conference structure at all."
59,119,Lauren,"I think that speaks to the way that approaching theory of mind allows you to just be more generous in the way you conceptualise other people's intentions or their motivations or their actions, which is one thing I really appreciate about it."
59,120,Gretchen,"I also think that there's -- I mean, this is definitely not in the canon of theory of mind -- but it's part of this thinking and reasoning about other people's mental states. It's also what the mental state is that you impose on someone else by reacting to something."
59,121,Lauren,Okay. I'm now very conscious about whatever I say in response to this anecdote.
59,122,Gretchen,"I'm sorry. An example of this is the xkcd comic 'Lucky Ten Thousand,' which reads, 'I try not to make fun of people for admitting they don't know things. Because for each thing 'Everyone knows' by the time they're adults, every day there are, on average, 10,000 people in the US hearing about it for the first time.' And there's some calculations. 'If I make fun of people, I train them not tell me when they have these moments. And I miss out on the fun.' Then the little comic strip -- this is two people -- one says, 'Diet Coke and Mentos thing? What's that?' And the other one says, 'Oh, man! C'mon we're going to the grocery store.' 'Why?' 'You're one of today's lucky ten thousand.' Some of my friend groups have adopted 'lucky ten thousand' when someone mentions like 'Oh, what is this book?' or 'What is this thing?' rather than say 'Oh, you haven't heard of that? What?'"
59,123,Lauren,"I can actually tell you exactly how Gretchen says it because Gretchen said to me when we were preparing for this, 'Oh, you haven't heard of the 'Lucky Ten Thousand'? Oh my gosh, do I have the link for you.'"
59,124,Gretchen,[Laughs] Exactly.
59,125,Lauren,It was so nice to not feel embarrassed to not know every comic in a canonical webcomic series and to be introduced to this very excellent one.
59,126,Gretchen,"It makes the conversation happen in a much more positive way because then -- you know, nobody's read all the books. Nobody has done all of the things. You can have the conversation of 'Oh, well, what did you like about it?' or 'What is interesting about it?' without the shaming version of the conversation of 'Why haven't you done this?' or 'What's wrong with you that you don't know this thing already?' I think this is a similar thing that happens when you create things as well, like 'I wrote a book' or 'on this podcast.' Sometimes, we'll say something there or give some -- like, here's a set of examples or something. And sometimes people will reply, 'Oh, I listened to your thing,' 'I liked your thing and here is this other example for you.' Like, 'Here's another thing that you might like.' That frame is a really positive way of having that conversation and is something that I can then share with other people and say, 'Oh, here's this other thing that people might be interested in.' I can retweet it. Or 'Here's something else going on.'"
59,127,Lauren,I always feel bad when people phrase it as though we have deliberately omitted something for nefarious reasons when it's often just that we have a finite amount of time and there're many languages.
59,128,Gretchen,"Also, we don't know everything. Sometimes, someone tells us about a new example."
59,129,Lauren,"Sometimes, we get to be one of the lucky ten thousand for a topic in linguistics, and it makes us very happy."
59,130,Gretchen,"The thing is, is the intentions are generally really good. People are excited to share things. They're excited to talk about things. It's just this common way of responding to things that doesn't end up leading into the conversation that you wanna have and with a slight tweak could totally do that like the 'lucky ten thousand thing."
59,131,Lauren,I also think about this modelling other people's mental states and knowledge. I think one of the peak activities for that is creating a forwardable email.
59,132,Gretchen,Ooo.
59,133,Lauren,"For those of us who spend a lot of time on email, occasionally, someone will say, 'Cool. I'm glad we've agreed to do this thing. Can you put the details in a forwardable email so I can send it to the rest of the group?'"
59,134,Gretchen,"Right. Or 'Can you introduce me to this person. Here's why I think they'd be interested in talking about it.' And I'll say, 'Okay, I'll write a forwardable email. I can send it to them, and then they can decide if they wanna talk to you,' or something like that."
59,135,Lauren,"Me and this other person know that this email exchange has happened. I now need to write a single, useful, context-filled email that that person can forward on to the group that they want to do the thing with or someone that I am hoping to be introduced to. It requires me to think about what I know, what the person who asked me to do this email knows, and what this third person, who hasn't been part of any of the prior conversation but needs all of the relevant context, needs to know. I just think that the mental state modelling involved and the mentalising what this person who hasn't been part of the conversation needs is like Dunbar's mental representation stuff as, like, multidimensional chess."
59,136,Gretchen,"Because you end up saying -- like, to the person you're actually emailing, you're telling them all of this information they already know, and that's why you can sometimes specify to someone like, 'Oh, yeah, please send me an email that I can forward to this person.' If I'm receiving a forwardable email, I know that you're repeating information that I know, and it's not patronising in this context because you know that I know that I'm gonna forward it to this third person who doesn't know these things and so, therefore, that's why you're repeating this information that I already knew. There's so many levels of understanding what other people are gonna potentially think in there."
59,137,Lauren,"This is why, before we even get to thinking about language, we have to think about the cognitive processes that allow us to know where the marble is, to know if someone thinks cake is delicious, or to go to put everything into an email.[Music]"

60,1,Gretchen,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics! I'm Gretchen McCulloch."
60,2,Lauren,"I'm Lauren Gawne. Today we're getting enthusiastic about space between words and affixes, also known as clitics. But first, we have an announcement. We're doing a special drive to encourage people to become patrons of Lingthusiasm this month."
60,3,Gretchen,"If you've been meaning to become a patron and just never quite gotten around to it, now is a great chance to join. We're gonna be sending out packs of four Lingthusiasm stickers to everyone who's a patron at the Ling-phabet tier on November 3, 2021."
60,4,Lauren,"This is going to be a Lingthusiasm logo sticker, two different versions of our 'Schwa, Never Stressed' stickers in different colours, and a bookplate sticker for Because Internet, which Gretchen is going to sign for you."
60,5,Gretchen,"Yes, I am. Make me sign a lot of stickers. You can stick these stickers on your laptop, your water bottle, anywhere else you wanna have an excuse to bring up how cool linguistics is in polite company."
60,6,Lauren,"If you're already a patron at a lower level, first of all, thank you! And second, this is a great reason to upgrade as there are some cool things available, especially if you stick around in this tier, including your name and favourite IPA character on our Supporter Wall of Fame."
60,7,Gretchen,"If you don't already have a favourite IPA character, you can take our extremely scientific 'Which IPA Character are You' quiz and find out."
60,8,Lauren,We hand choose all the IPA characters for our supporters on the Wall of Fame.
60,9,Gretchen,From the results of this highly scientific quiz.
60,10,Lauren,"Plus, you also get a 'Lingthusiast' sticker after three months of this tier that Patreon sends you."
60,11,Gretchen,That's so many stickers. That's five stickers. Two different things in the mail.
60,12,Lauren,"If you're already supporting us at this level or a higher level, you also get the sticker pack, and we'll be sending you a message to remind you to make sure your address is up-to-date so we know where to send those stickers. Finally, all patrons at all levels, we appreciate you so much. As we say every episode, it's our patrons who keep the show ad-free and who also get access to monthly bonus episodes, including our most recent, Number 54, an interview with Emily Gref of Planet Word. You also have access to our Discord to chat with other Lingthusiasm and linguistics fans."
60,13,Gretchen,"We had a really fun time talking with Emily from Planet Word. Hopefully, we'll get to check out that museum at some point. So, go listen to that. [Music]"
60,14,Gretchen,"Okay, Lauren, I have a sentence for you and a task, if you're okay with that."
60,15,Lauren,Yep. Sounds very exciting.
60,16,Gretchen,"I'm gonna give you a sentence, and then in this sentence, I want you to identify the words and the affixes. That's prefixes and suffixes."
60,17,Lauren,I'm gonna grab two different coloured pens. I'm very excited.
60,18,Gretchen,This is one of those Grade 8 English class underlining things.
60,19,Lauren,This is why I love linguistics puzzles. You get to crack out the coloured pens.
60,20,Gretchen,"Exactly. The sentence is, 'Later today, I'll know if I hafta get some prizes for Helen of Troy's competition, or if it isn't necessary.'"
60,21,Lauren,"Before I even begin to pull this wonderful sentence apart, can we just revel in the fact that so many sentences that get said have never been said in the history of humanity before."
60,22,Gretchen,I'm pretty sure that this one has not been said in the history of humanity before.
60,23,Lauren,"I like this sub-story of The Iliad that I've never heard before. I'll go with it. I have an advantage that I am looking at this sentence on a piece of paper. I'm pulling out lots of words. 'Prizes' is a word. But I can pull 'prizes' apart because I can have 'prize' and then the plural S. 'Prize' gets one colour, and the S gets another colour. We've also got 'competition.' I know 'com-' is a prefix, and '-tition' is a suffix that can change the word."
60,24,Gretchen,So maybe like 'compete' and '-tition' or something like that?
60,25,Lauren,"Yeah. We have a whole episode on morphemes and how they build up into words. We'll link to that in the show notes. I feel pretty comfortable with the things that are words, and I feel pretty comfortable pulling out things that are affixes. But, Gretchen, I only have two colours of pen, and I've got some words that I'm a bit stuck on."
60,26,Gretchen,Okay.
60,27,Lauren,"'Hafta,' as you have pronounced it and as it's written -- H-A-F-T-A."
60,28,Gretchen,"As I very carefully said 'hafta,' which is not my usual reading vocabulary, but there we are."
60,29,Lauren,Casually carefully you pronounced it. I know that that is an informal pronunciation of 'have to' -- 'I have to get' -- but it's one of those things that everyone does. It's so common. I want to kind of treat 'hafta' like a single word. I'm a bit stuck on that one.
60,30,Gretchen,But you're not sure if you're gonna but you just sort of wanna just to put a few more in there.
60,31,Lauren,"Yes. I'm gonna put 'hafta' with a bit of a question mark. I'm gonna add 'I'll' to that category because, again, that '-ll' at the end of 'I'll' -- I know and you know that that's a conjoined form there. It's normally 'will' as a full thing, but it can just as easily be 'I'll.' I feel like '-ll' is kind of an affix, but it's more word-y than an affix."
60,32,Gretchen,"Yeah. Because for something like 'prizes,' you don't know where the /z/ is coming from. There's not some other word that you know where it's from."
60,33,Lauren,"Exactly. Then, 'Helen of Troy's' is an interesting phrase because it's got that /s/ on the end, but unlike the /s/ in 'prizes,' it's relating to the whole of 'Helen of Troy's.' It's not just relating to Troy there. Again, question mark on that one. And the '-n't' in 'isn't' is a bit like the '-ll' in 'I'll.'"
60,34,Gretchen,"We've got three tricky things at the boundaries which I have to confess that I carefully constructed this sentence to make it a tricky situation because we wanna talk today about what's going on with things that are kind of word-like but also kind of affix-like and are in that tricky boundary in between the two. We've got a few examples like, 'I'll, 'hafta,' 'Helen of Troy's,' and 'isn't.'"
60,35,Lauren,"We not only have talked about morphemes in an episode, we've talked about words. We've talked about whether something is a word or not in a way that was really focused on meaning. For these, a lot of it is not so much about meaning but about the shape of the affix or the shape of the word that it would've been as a full word. It's revisiting that topic but from a different perspective."
60,36,Gretchen,"I think the thing that's satisfying to me is that these nebulously defined word and affix-y-like things have a name for them which is not as well-known as 'word' or 'affix,' these well-known things, but they're called 'clitics.' When we were preparing for this episode, we were looking up, 'Okay, what is the formal definition for 'clitic' anyway? Surely someone's written this. We can just read it out.' The answer is that linguists disagree."
60,37,Lauren,Indeed.
60,38,Gretchen,"Linguists disagree a lot about exactly what a clitic is precisely because it occupies that interesting space between, you know, here are these things that you can very clearly say them all by themselves in isolation like 'I' and 'will' and 'is' and 'not,' and then here are these things that you very clearly have to put them on a word. They're incoherent without a word. And then some stuff that floats around the sentence that you're like, 'Okay, maybe this is a full word. Maybe it's attached to something else.' It's a little bit unclear what the status is. Different clitics can behave in different ways, and they can all be lumped together as here's this big category of stuff that we don't know what to do with. Or you can be someone who's really a splitter and saying, 'Okay, no, these ones, I think they are more like actual affixes, and these ones, I think they are more word-y, and these are the true clitics that are the smaller set in the middle.' It really depends on if you wanna be a lumper or a splitter there."
60,39,Lauren,"In order to decide what is and isn't a clitic, you have rules and principles that are specific to the language that you're talking about. When it comes to drilling into the specifics of English and how the grammar of English works, you can't get much more drilling down and specificity in a single book than the Cambridge Grammar of the English Language. It's time for another episode of Gretchen's adventures in CGEL."
60,40,Gretchen,"I have a massive copy of the Cambridge Grammar of the English Language. It's over a thousand pages. It has made an appearance in some previous Lingthusiasm episodes because it's got these very, very detailed descriptions of various aspects of what's going on in English."
60,41,Lauren,"When it comes to a phenomenon like clitics where there's a lot of slightly different things happening between different examples, something that has a lot of detail is exactly what we need."
60,42,Gretchen,"Right. One of the things that CGEL talks about with respect to clitics is that there's a grade in English between the ones that have very a restricted set of places where they can be found and ones that have a bit less restriction in terms of where they can be found. Even within clitics there are immediately, as soon as you get there, subcategories. One of those is -- so clitic forms of 'am,' 'are,' 'have,' and 'will,' attach only to a subject pronoun rather than to a full noun. You can have 'I'm,' 'we're,' 'they've,' 'he'll.' CGEL says that if you have a compound subject with a noun and a pronoun in it -- like a longer thing but it still has a pronoun -- you don't generally get something like, 'Joe and you are in for a shock' -- 'Joe and you're in for a shock.' I don't think I'd say that."
60,43,Lauren,You actually struggled to say it. You didn't even get it right the first time.
60,44,Gretchen,"I read it on the page, and I was like, 'No, I can totally say that.' Then I'm reading it out loud, and I'm like, 'No, I can't actually say, 'Joe and you're in for a shock.' Maybe I can say, 'Both of you've been pretty inconsiderate.'"
60,45,Lauren,[Laughs] 'Both of you've been pretty inconsiderate.' It definitely sounds like you're squishing two different sentences together that don't belong together.
60,46,Gretchen,"What do you think about 'The Smiths will be there, and so'll I.'"
60,47,Lauren,"Oh, that one actually is less bad."
60,48,Gretchen,"I don't mind that as much. You can use something like, 'Pat'll do it.' You could put it on just a noun by itself, but if you have the compound subject --"
60,49,Lauren,It gets a little bit less pleasant to my intuitions.
60,50,Gretchen,"'Joe and you're in for a shock' just really doesn't work for me, actually."
60,51,Lauren,"Which is impressive that it's getting stronger as it's not working for you because, normally, once you've been exposed to these things for a while, you're like, 'Maybe? I don't know anymore.'"
60,52,Gretchen,"You can put it on something like, 'You could've been hurt,' the '-ve' works there. The one that I find more fun -- and this one is less restricted. Clitic forms of 'is' and 'has' -- you can put them in a lot of places. You have something like, 'Jean's here,' and 'Jean's taken it,' which actually sounds the same as 'jeans' like the pants."
60,53,Lauren,That is true.
60,54,Gretchen,"That really works. You can also put it on longer phrases which don't work as well for 'are' or 'have.' You can say something like, 'Which dog's been on the sofa?' Sounds fine to me. 'That they're wet's obvious enough.'"
60,55,Lauren,'I'm gonna have to put them in the drier because that they're wet's obvious enough.'
60,56,Gretchen,'What do you think's gonna happen?' Totally fine for me.
60,57,Lauren,Absolutely.
60,58,Gretchen,"'Ed, I think, is going, and so's Sue.'"
60,59,Lauren,Great. Looking forward to seeing them there.
60,60,Gretchen,"'Why's this happening?' 'What the heck's she's doing?' All of these -- totally fine. You're like, 'Yeah, I can put 'is' and 'has' anywhere. It's fine.' And then they point out that there are some bad examples."
60,61,Lauren,Okay. Please break my brain.
60,62,Gretchen,What do you think about 'What salad's that man over there eating?'
60,63,Lauren,'What salad's that man over there eating?' That works for me.
60,64,Gretchen,"This one is with a percent sign. Some people have it and some people don't. I find it not quite as good as the others, but I think I'm okay with it. 'Don't use more force than's absolutely necessary.'"
60,65,Lauren,'Don't use more force than's absolutely necessary.'
60,66,Gretchen,I don't think you like that one.
60,67,Lauren,"No, that's weird."
60,68,Gretchen,That's also a percent sign one. Some people might like it. Some people might not.
60,69,Lauren,"Yeah, I should say it's weird for me."
60,70,Gretchen,"I think maybe I can get it but maybe not. Maybe my impressions are just broken from reading this book. Here's one they don't think people are gonna be able to get and that's, 'Never's it going to be easier.'"
60,71,Lauren,'Never's it going to be easier.' It definitely is a bit trip-y up-y.
60,72,Gretchen,"What do you think about, 'She often's right about things.' [Pause] [Gretchen laughs]"
60,73,Lauren,Is that one a percent?
60,74,Gretchen,No. That one is star. That one is nobody.
60,75,Lauren,"Okay, I am relieved."
60,76,Gretchen,"'Never's' is also nobody, but 'She often's right about things' and 'Never's it gonna be easier.' Yet, 'She often is right about things,' that would be fine."
60,77,Lauren,Fine.
60,78,Gretchen,"This brings us to a post that went viral from Tumblr a while back. This was somebody -- just-shower-thoughts -- observing that 'Contractions function almost identically to the full two-word phrase, but are only appropriate in some places in a sentence. It's one of the weird quirks of this language we've.'"
60,79,Lauren,It's because 'have' there is being used as an auxiliary instead of the full form of having and ownership.
60,80,Gretchen,Maybe. What do you think about a further comment on it? 'Some people say the English language is confusing. To which I say...It's.'
60,81,Lauren,That one definitely feels like it's missing another word at least.
60,82,Gretchen,"I'm very delighted that I added a comment to it myself, four years ago, and that that has gotten picked up in the form that keeps getting screen capped and passed around which was, 'That's the kind of linguist I'm.'"
60,83,Lauren,That absolutely does not work. Congratulations on making more than one sentence that has broken my brain this episode.
60,84,Gretchen,"It actually took me quite a long time to come up with that sentence, so I'm really pleased."
60,85,Lauren,I do see that circulating occasionally. It's very satisfying.
60,86,Gretchen,"Yeah, every so often I see it, and I'm like, 'Oh, that was me.' I think it also speaks to a really interesting point about clitics in general because sometimes one of the things that comes up when you're talking about reduced forms of words or smooshing words together, people will start saying like, 'Oh, these are lazy,' or 'These are low effort. Why are people doing this low effort thing? Shouldn't everyone just be talking in full words with lots of pauses in between them like a robot?'"
60,87,Lauren,I absolutely refer to your example as having casual features of English. That's a slightly less judge-y way of saying the same thing.
60,88,Gretchen,Right. But the thing that's really interesting is there are these kinds of constraints. Nobody who is saying 'I'm' and 'I'll' and 'I've' and all of these things that everyone says is doing it in this weird position at the end of the sentence.
60,89,Lauren,"If it was just about laziness and efficiency, you'd expect it to be able to be used everywhere."
60,90,Gretchen,"Right! You'd expect it to just be like, 'Okay, yeah, we've just gonna do this low effort thing,' but it's actually more effort, at least to some subconscious level, to be keeping track of like, 'Okay, yeah, you can do this reduction thing in some places but not in other places.' Imagine trying to explain that to a new speaker of like, 'Oh, yeah, well, no, we have this abbreviation form, but actually it's never put here.' Like, 'Wait, why? This is an extra thing to pay attention to.' There's a lot of interesting subtle things going on in terms of where we use them."
60,91,Lauren,I hadn't even thought about the restrictions that clitic forms in English have until you showed me places they shouldn't be.
60,92,Gretchen,"I hadn't thought of them either. This is why you go consult a grammar because they've gone through all this effort to make all these beautiful, ungrammatical sentences for you. Reading CGEL about clitics also reminded me of this other thing that's below the level of fully conscious speech in English which is that there's a certain set of words that have stronger and weaker forms -- shorter and longer forms -- at a sound level."
60,93,Lauren,Because one of the features of a clitic is that it is reduced in terms of its sound compared to a full word.
60,94,Gretchen,"Exactly. You don't get a clitic that's four syllables long because at the point when it's becoming a clitic, it's already, like, maybe doesn't even have a vowel in it."
60,95,Lauren,"When 'will' attaches to something else a clitic to make '-ll.' You never wanna say it can't happen because then there'll be one example from someone somewhere, but it would be supremely unusual for something to be a clitic and then become a lot longer."
60,96,Gretchen,"I think it would be weird because the words that tend to become clitics are already words that have become grammatical words and that are really high frequency. Those tend to be short as well. I mean, never say never. Maybe there's some language that does it. But I think it would be uncommon. This gets us into this question of what are words that are potentially good targets to become clitics. These are often words that are already getting smaller phonologically. In CGEL they talk about weak versus strong forms of certain words."
60,97,Lauren,I don't think I've had someone put this like this before. What would an example of that look like?
60,98,Gretchen,"Their example is 'I think Pat has seen it' and 'I haven't seen it, but Pat has.'"
60,99,Lauren,I don't even know what I'm listening for there.
60,100,Gretchen,"You're listening for the word 'has.' 'I think Pat /əz/ seen it.' 'I haven't seen it, but Pat /hæz/.'"
60,101,Lauren,That's the difference between /həz/ and /hæz/.
60,102,Gretchen,And even shorter because the 'Pat has seen it' is often just /əz/.
60,103,Lauren,"Ah, yeah."
60,104,Gretchen,"There's an H written there, but 'Pat /əz/' -- you probably don't even say it. Then 'has' has that H, and it has a full vowel, not this tiny schwa, and then they both have the /z/ there. There's actually quite a difference in terms of how they're pronounced. There's about 50 words that CGEL lists that have one or more weak forms as well as a strong form. It's gonna actually be weird to read this list because I'm gonna have to read these words in strong form because you would say them in strong form in isolation because isolation is one of the environments where you use the strong form of a word."
60,105,Lauren,Okay.
60,106,Gretchen,This is words like 'a' --
60,107,Lauren,"As in, like, 'a car'?"
60,108,Gretchen,"Yeah, 'a car.' 'Am.'"
60,109,Lauren,'I'm.'
60,110,Gretchen,'I'm.' 'And.'
60,111,Lauren,/ənd/
60,112,Gretchen,Yeah. Or just /ən/.
60,113,Lauren,To the point where English speakers do the little /ən/ between words.
60,114,Gretchen,"'Fish 'n chips.' I'm not gonna read the whole list. You can see that there's sort of, like, 'a' and 'am' and 'and' are all different types of things. One of them is a verb. One of them is a conjunction. One of them is an article -- a determiner. There's a bunch of different categories. You have some prepositions like 'for' which could be 'for' but also --"
60,115,Lauren,/fə/.
60,116,Gretchen,"/fɹ̩/. You have stuff like 'of,' 'my,' 'must,' 'me,' 'who,' 'you,' which can become /jə/. These are all small words. All of them are a single syllable. If they begin with H, the H often gets kicked off."
60,117,Lauren,"The thing I really like about 'a' or 'an' on that list, like 'a prize,' is that this is part of an ongoing journey for that word. Because that word started off as 'an,' which was essentially the word 'one.' Then 'one' went off in one direction with all of its articulation still, and then 'an' became 'a' and is now just /ə/. It's why you get things like /əloʊn/."
60,118,Gretchen,"Exactly. Or 'only' because it was /oʊn/. The fun thing is, is 'a' can be reduced to just /ə/, but /əv/ can also be reduced is just /ə/. 'To' can also be reduced to just /ə/. You have gonna /gənə/, lotta /latə/ -- 'a lot of things' -- /gənə/, /goʊ/. All of them can get reduced because they all occur in such different environments that it's never ambiguous which one is which. What's interesting is that if a word becomes a clitic -- it's because a lot of the English words started out as a weak form of a word and then subsequently became a clitic."
60,119,Lauren,"The thing that makes me so happy about this is when we started this episode, I thought we were gonna look at what was between an affix and a word and that that was gonna be clitics. Now, I find out there's a thing between clitics and words and that everything is on these processes. There are multiple steps that you can watch happen."
60,120,Gretchen,"The thing that's interesting about the steps is they interact. Something can become a clitic if it's already in the weak form. It can become even weaker and become a clitic and really hang onto or lean onto the word next to it. But the reason why you can't say something like, 'That's the kind of linguist I'm,' is because you can't even use the weak form of 'am' at the end of a word like that."
60,121,Lauren,How satisfying.
60,122,Gretchen,"This was our 'I haven't seen it, but Pat has.' You also can't say, 'I haven't seen it, but Pat's.'"
60,123,Lauren,No. Because I don't even know what that /s/ is there.
60,124,Gretchen,"Yeah. But 'I think Pat's seen it' -- fine. 'I haven't seen it, but Pat's.' This context forces you to use the strong form of a word, which means it's not even a possible target for becoming a clitic, which is one of those subconscious things that you're like 'I didn't even know I knew this.'"
60,125,Lauren,"I do feel like a lot of not ever noticing this phenomenon of weak forms is because we are so dependent on English writing for the way we conceptualise words even when we hear them. If you're a very literate English speaker, your perception of the written form can play tricks on your brain in terms of the pronounced form."
60,126,Gretchen,"I said, 'I think Pat /əz/ seen it' to you several times, and you were like, 'Yeah, the H is still there,' and I'm like, 'I'm not saying an H.' Because the writing is like, 'Hey, look, there's an H.' It's just not there."
60,127,Lauren,Absolutely hallucinated that H there.
60,128,Gretchen,"The fun thing is, is not every language does this. When I was studying Dutch for a bit, one of the things that was fascinating to learn was that they actually do have different spellings for strong and weak forms of their pronouns."
60,129,Lauren,So good.
60,130,Gretchen,"For example, the Dutch word for 'me,' which is -- you'll be able to see the cognates with English -- can be written M-I-J, which is pronounced /me/, or it can be written M-E, which is pronounced /mə/. This is probably true of English as well. There's an emphasis given to 'me' and then like, 'Yeah, he gave it to me, and then whatever.' There's probably a /mə/ form in English as well, but they're both written the same way. You do sometimes see this for pronouns, especially for third person pronouns. Like, 'Give it to 'im,' 'Give it to 'er,' 'Give it to 'em.'' You sometimes see those written with an apostrophe instead of the H, but it's not something you get a table of like, 'Make sure you learn these weak forms,' in the same way as Dutch."
60,131,Lauren,"No, I absolutely have not."
60,132,Gretchen,"There is a fun story with, actually, this ''em,' if you say something like, 'Go get 'em.' What does that E-M stand for?"
60,133,Lauren,'Them.' Because it's third person plural.
60,134,Gretchen,"Well, you'd think because that's what our modern third person plural is. But in what other context do we drop a /ð/ sound?"
60,135,Lauren,It's true. It's not one of those easy-to-loose sounds.
60,136,Gretchen,"Right. We have a strong and a weak form of 'the.' You have /ðʌ/ or /ði/. Then you have /ðə/. But when you're reducing it, you're reducing the vowel. You're not taking it down to /i/."
60,137,Lauren,True.
60,138,Gretchen,"The ''em' is actually a form of 'hem,' which was the object third person plural pronoun in Middle English."
60,139,Lauren,"Oh, how satisfying."
60,140,Gretchen,"Right. Before we had 'he,' 'she,' 'it,' 'they,' we had /he/, /heo/, /hɪt/, and /hie/. These sound extremely similar to each other. There was differentiation that happened. We acquired the form 'she.' Then we also acquired the 'they' and the 'them' instead of /hie/ and /hem/ from Norse."
60,141,Lauren,But kept our habit of using the old weak form.
60,142,Gretchen,But kept the old weak form the same with that dropped H. It's just sort of crept along. It's crept along in such an oral way. Because you're not getting that from writing. You're getting it from other people speaking in a chain.
60,143,Lauren,"This is true. Although, I do find it even more satisfying now that the Pokémon trainer Ash has the surname Ketchum 'Catch 'em.' Bits of his name are in Old English."
60,144,Gretchen,There's some Old English stuff that's just getting re-spelled by modern speakers to refer to something.
60,145,Lauren,How delightful.
60,146,Gretchen,"This is actually something that I think is a really interesting area for development in English because we have this unstressed form in the 'they' paradigm, which it's a relative newcomer in English even though it's centuries old. But other neo-pronouns in English like 'xe/xem,' you've got to think like, okay, they're gonna need unstressed forms as well. They're gonna need weak forms like /zə//zəm/ as well so that they can be used in all of the same contexts. Maybe people are already, probably, doing this subconsciously."
60,147,Lauren,"Sounds like a fascinating research paper. I think I should point out even single, tiny digression we've been on and every single example CGEL gives has been agonised over and thought about. The space that it fits in between words and affixes has been pondered over long and hard. As we said, it is very dependent on the specific features of the language that you're working with to decide if something is an affix or a clitic. I thought I'd give an example from the languages that I work with when I had to decide, writing the grammar of Yolmo, if I was gonna treat some things as affixes or some things as clitics."
60,148,Gretchen,Please tell me how you made that decision.
60,149,Lauren,"Because the criteria are language-specific, like English, I was looking at things that weren't quite as attached to individual words as affixes. There are affixes in Yolmo. There's one if you want to say that you're counting a number of people, you put an affix on the numeral that indicates specifically that that numeral is related to two people or five people. That can only ever go on a numeral. Then you have these affixes like the plural. You might have 'the dogs,' or you might have 'the dog of my friends.' Even though in English that sounds like a possessive, that's where you could put the plural in these languages."
60,150,Gretchen,"Oh, so 'the dog of my friends' is actually, like, several dogs belonging to my friend?"
60,151,Lauren,Yeah.
60,152,Gretchen,Which is sort of like 'Helen of Troy's party' or something like that. That S is actually possessed by 'Helen' not possessed by 'Troy.'
60,153,Lauren,"Yeah. It's a bit more free-floating than the affix that has to go on a number. So, you go, 'Well, maybe it's a word,' but it can't be a word either because words have tone in Yolmo and many Tibetan languages. These plural markers don't have tone. You go, 'Well, it's not an affix because it's more free floating. And it's not a word, so it doesn't have tone. It's a clitic!'"
60,154,Gretchen,Yay! We have this third category.
60,155,Lauren,Thank goodness I have more than two coloured pens because for this part of this grammar using the term 'clitic' became incredibly helpful.
60,156,Gretchen,"That's such a good example of how the diagnostic criteria is really language specific because you're like, 'Okay, well, it doesn't have tone, so it can't be a word.' I assume that there's an entire chain of logic for why all words have tone. But in English, this is like, okay, this is not the diagnostic criteria you're gonna use."
60,157,Lauren,Absolutely. Some of the criteria in English around weak forms or reduced pronunciation doesn't work in these languages. Coming at it from a language-specific perspective is really helpful.
60,158,Gretchen,"Sometimes, also, coming at it from a language-specific perspective will be influenced by the history of the writing system for that language and how the language was written down because, you know, if people are used to writing something as the full form, even though the speech sometimes for quite a long time has been reducing it more and more, there'll still be this tendency sometimes to be like, okay, we're gonna write out the full form. That's why it feels so recoverable. Or we're going to -- okay, yeah, but no one actually says it that way, but there's still all this written stuff that can influence what people are thinking about."
60,159,Lauren,I sometimes wonder if English 'a' and 'the' would be more likely to be treated as clitics if they were physically attached to the words they were in front of.
60,160,Gretchen,"Yeah, if they were written there with a little apostrophe or something. When I was looking at this, I was surprised to find that some people think that 'n't,' (like 'isn't,' 'can't,') isn't actually a clitic in English. It's just an affix -- it's on the whole word. Because I was like, 'But this is so clearly related to 'not'' -- but also it affects the vowels of the thing it's attached to. You have stuff like 'won't,' which isn't really transparently 'willn't.' Maybe these are some reasons to say, 'Actually, this is an affix now. It just happens to resemble the negative thing.'"
60,161,Lauren,I do wonder if English cycles of things becoming attached and becoming more like an affix have been arrested a little bit because of that tradition of writing.
60,162,Gretchen,"There's this really fun one that I've noticed in English that really trips up people who speak languages with fewer vowels than English. This is the 'can/can't' distinction. In English, in unstressed words, if you have a T or D after an N, it often gets deleted. This is why you see 'fish 'n chips' with that N there. It happens all over the place. It happens constantly -- place names, people say Toronto (toronno) /təɹɑnoʊ/ without the second T because it's something you say a lot. This is super common in English -- super normal. It happens in all of these negative words. Like, 'don't' becomes /dən/, which is fine because it's not contrasting with another /dən/."
60,163,Lauren,"But if you remove the /t/ in 'can't,' you get 'can,' which is confusing."
60,164,Gretchen,"Which is the positive form. But no, it's not actually confusing in practice for speakers of English who have all of the vowels that English is used to, because there's also a reduced form of 'can,' which is /kən/. Most English speakers most of the time actually make the distinction between /kən/ and /kæn/ where /kən/ is positive and /kæn/ is negative. It's just got a full vowel."
60,165,Lauren,"It's absolutely one of those things that I will have to go find examples in my own speech before I believe that I do this, but I am open to being shown."
60,166,Gretchen,"I have witnessed this in conversations where you have one native English speaker and one second language English speaker. The native English speaker will be like, 'No, no, no, I /kæn/ do it.' And the non-native English speaker will be like, 'You're saying you can, but it seems from the context like you can't.' They'll be hyper-articulating the /kæn/ with even more emphasis on the vowel and still not putting the T in that would actually let you figure out what was going on because the T is just so far gone. There's a fun example in the musical Hamilton where there's a line about the young Alexander Hamilton who's poor and has no money and is working at his first job. The line is 'Trading sugarcane and rum and all the things he /kæn/ afford.' The way that the performer gives the real stress on /kæn/, like, it's not even a reduced form anymore because he's putting this real stress on it, but there's no T. It's extremely clear from context that he can't afford them. It's very distinctly articulated. There is no T there anywhere."
60,167,Lauren,"But as long as we have this writing system, people are gonna hallucinate that T."
60,168,Gretchen,"If we were sensible, we could just spell them with different vowel symbols and actually just do the thing that we think we're doing, but we're not gonna do that."
60,169,Lauren,I feel pretty safe to say.
60,170,Gretchen,"Another place where you see this real, real effect of orthography is in French. I came across, a number of years ago, a Reddit post that, alas, I cannot find anymore where somebody had posted, 'Hey, guys, I have this new conlang. It's got subject prefixes. It's got object prefixes. You could put negation as a prefix. You can do all this stuff as a thing.' It was like, 'Here's this conlang that's got these very long words that have all these different prefixes and so on stacked on them. What do you think of my new conlang?' If you read it out loud, it was actually French written phonetically."
60,171,Lauren,[Laughs] What a sneaky joke.
60,172,Gretchen,"It's really interesting. I know it was a joke, and I think that there are still arguments why French is not a massively agglutinative language with all these subject prefixes and so on. But ever since that joke post, I have never been entirely certain anymore."
60,173,Lauren,"Again, you need something that's the equivalent of CGEL for French to do the hard work of picking it apart."
60,174,Gretchen,"Not just CGEL for French, but it would have to be CGEL for spoken French. Because written French comes from this tradition where it's not, but modern day spoken French is quite divergent from written French. There's even more of an aspect in learning how to read where you learn a bunch of stuff that used to be true, and then you have to unlearn that to talk to people. A really interesting example is there're a lot of languages where you change the form of the verb, and then you can tell what the subject is. This is still true in a bunch of other Romance languages. Spanish and Italian, you change the verb, and you can tell if it's me or if it's you. In French, you do change this in the writing, but what you actually do is you have to have the pronoun. So, if you have something like, 'Je prends les crêpes. Tu prends l'omelette,' which is what you might say at a restaurant -- 'I'll take the crepes. You can have the omelette.'"
60,175,Lauren,Thanks for ordering for me. I hate making choices. [Laughter]
60,176,Gretchen,"You have the 'je' and the 'tu' that's telling the different there. But these are, in French, clitic pronouns. They're definitely at least clitics because you really have to put them, and you have to put them leaning on the verb. You can't say them in isolation."
60,177,Lauren,That's a really good diagnostic criterion.
60,178,Gretchen,"You could, in English, say, 'Who ordered the crepes?' You could say, 'Me.' You could say, 'It is I,' if you wanna sound kind of formal. Both of these are sort of okay. In French, you cannot say, 'je.' Like, 'Who ordered the crepes?' 'Je.' No. No, no, no, no, no, no. You need to use this whole other form of the pronoun, which is the only one that can happen by itself, which is 'moi.' Then, if you wanna be emphatic about it, you can say, 'Moi je prends les crêpes,' which is often translated sort of like, 'Me, I'll have the crepes.' But it actually shows up in the same context as in a language like Spanish or Italian where you would actually just put in the normal subject pronoun because you don't normally need it because the verb at the end tells you."
60,179,Lauren,Amazing.
60,180,Gretchen,"I really kind of wanna make the case that this is actually -- it's not even a clitic anymore. It's actually fully glommed onto the verb. But, you know, the Académie Française is gonna completely disagree with me."
60,181,Lauren,"It is a good demonstration that something -- and a lot of the examples we've discussed in this episode start as words and then, in English, we've seen those weak forms of words, allow them to become clitics. With the literal etymology of 'enclitic' in Latin being 'to lean' -- so begin to lean on words. They're not fully attached. They're just leaning on them. Which I get a very cosy visual image with that etymology. Then, once they've been leaning on words for long enough, they become dependent and really attach to them as affixes. This process of going from being an independent word, especially in these functional categories, through to being a fully-attached part of the grammar is something that happens repeatedly within a single language across time and across all of our spoken and signed human languages -- this process of grammaticalising through from being words to affixes and occasionally stopping off as clitics in between."
60,182,Gretchen,"Sometimes a clitic is this pathway. If you think of 'n't' in English where it's like, okay, maybe that's a clitic, but maybe there's actually good reasons to say that it's part of the whole word by now. Sometimes, something can stay clitic-y, like maybe that apostrophe S in English. There's all sorts of stuff along the way. I mean, you could also see, in Romance languages, it's so well-established and has long been talked about historically that the pronouns are clitics that maybe some of them are actually not becoming clitics. Like in French or in Spanish, you can do both the pronoun and the full noun in some contexts, like 'Le di un regalo a mi madre,' which is literally like, 'To her, I gave a gift to my mother.' In English, you can't do this."
60,183,Lauren,Really doubling down there.
60,184,Gretchen,"You're doing both. In Spanish you can. You can make the argument that maybe this is the beginning of just marking the object on the verb, which lots of languages do. Then they do have you put the full noun as well. This is a pathway to making it more grammatical than the same thing in English where they're competing for the same position."
60,185,Lauren,"It just happens so frequently in this direction and, incredibly rarely, in the other direction that something will break free from a word. We've talked about 'ish' as a -- something's grammatical-ish. It can break away and become its own thing, ish, now. But the reason we keep bringing up that one example is because it's so unusual and that the tide just flows in the other direction overwhelmingly."
60,186,Gretchen,"The normal thing is for stuff to get smaller and shorter, especially when it's said a lot, and then gradually start merging with the words around it. It's such an interesting experience to me thinking of yourself in the middle of a language's history rather than at some sort of end point, like everything that was going on was building up to this, and to say, no, the stuff that we do now that's slang-y or casual or seems like it's just reduced effort is gonna be like, oh, yeah, no, here's this really grammatical thing that happens in another dozen generations.

61,2,Gretchen,"Hello, Kat, welcome to the show!"
61,3,Kat,"Hello, Gretchen, thank you very much for having me on here!"
61,4,Gretchen,Let's start with the question that we ask all of our guests -- how did you get into linguistics?
61,5,Kat,"You can probably tell from my accent that I am from the UK, and I was educated in the UK school system. For our listeners who aren't in the UK, what this means is that you are able to leave school at 16, having taken a set of subjects and exams, but if you want to continue your education, you need to take a different set of exams or a different set of courses. These are called AS-levels, which are the one-year course, and A-levels, which are the full two-year course. These are much more focused than, say, the US high school system. Most of our students coming to university have between probably three or four full A-levels and maybe one or two AS-levels. It's a very restricted set of subjects. It means that you have to make some quite hard decisions about what you go on to do. When I was 16, I was absolutely convinced that I wanted to go into biology. As you can see, this didn't happen."
61,6,Gretchen,"And yet, you're a linguist now. How did this come to be?"
61,7,Kat,"Exactly. I took a set of A-levels that were very, very science-y. I was doing biology and chemistry and, initially, physics. What I realised is that I didn't like this at all, and I wasn't very good at it either. But happily, for me, what I was doing was English literature. I was doing a weird module called 'Critical Thinking.' The teacher of that and I got on quite well. He was like, 'Oh, I could probably teach you AS-level philosophy.' The school was like, 'We don't offer this AS-level.' He was like, 'Surprise! Now, you do.' Basically, the teaching of this module entailed sitting in the school quad drinking really awful coffee and debating about whether God exists."
61,8,Gretchen,What more could you want from philosophy?
61,9,Kat,"I mean, Plato and Socrates would be so proud of me. The first essay I wrote was in the exam itself. [Laughter] But to my shock, I did well enough that it seemed reasonable to continue this. What I did is I found another sixth form college that were prepared to take me with my extremely messy academic history. They were like, 'Okay, what fits in your schedule?' One of the ones that did was English language. I was like, 'Okay, this sounds good.' I quite enjoyed this. They called the teacher over. We had a nice chat. She was like, 'Yeah, I think you can do the full two-year course in one year.'"
61,10,Gretchen,"So, English language is kind of like linguistics?"
61,11,Kat,"Yes. In the UK, we have a really, really weird system where linguistics seems to get called 'English language' certainly at GCSE, which is the pre-16 teaching I talked about, and at A-level. A lot of degrees end up calling their degrees 'English Language and Linguistics' to fit into that."
61,12,Gretchen,So that people who've done English language know that that's where they should be going.
61,13,Kat,"So there's a sense of continuity there. There I was in my first bit of teaching for this subject, and I was simultaneously attending the first-year lessons, which were like, 'Here is a noun. This is how we spot a noun phrase,' and also the second-year lessons which were, 'Now, do some clause analysis.'"
61,14,Gretchen,[Laughs] No!
61,15,Kat,"It was challenging, but it was really fun. I did this, and I thought, 'Actually, I wanna keep doing this. This is fascinating. This is enthralling on every level, and I want to do more of it.' But I did hedge my bets a bit. I applied to a degree programme in English language and literature at the University of Liverpool. Basically, after the first year, I was just like, 'I don't want to do any more literature.'"
61,16,Gretchen,'I am full on in this language thing.'
61,17,Kat,"Yeah, 'I am committing.' How I got into corpus linguistics is that -- I didn't know it when I was applying -- but there was this little corpus linguistic powerhouse at Liverpool. There were only three or four people involved in it, but they were super, super involved. They offered a module in the third year that was called 'corpus linguistics,' and I noticed it had a cap on. Only about seven people could take this module. I thought, 'This sounds weird. I want to do that.'"
61,18,Gretchen,'I want to be one of the chosen seven.'
61,19,Kat,"Yeah, 'I wanna be one of the chosen seven. I'm going to tough out this module.' Everyone was like, 'This is hard.' I was like, 'Yes, challenge accepted.' Off I went. Then I started learning about the tools that corpus linguists use and started building my own corpora. I built a tiny baby corpus of music reviews, and then did a little undergraduate project on it. I was just like, 'This is great. I love it.' Then they offered an MA in corpus linguistics, and I was like, 'Yes, I think I do want to take this,' so did it. I think for that one I looked at literature that was written for children and looked at gender in that. Then it came to thinking about PhDs. I thought, 'Well, obviously I want to keep doing this.' Also, when I was 13 or 14, we covered the suffrage movement very, very briefly in history. I was just -- there has to be more to this story. It has to be more complicated than these two pages in the textbook. When it came to forming my own research project, it was just, 'Right. I'm going to go back and investigate this.'"
61,20,Gretchen,"You were doing this in a corpus way. Maybe we should take a brief moment to talk about what a corpus is, and what people are doing with corpus linguistics. Basically, you have a collection of texts, and then you're trying to look at what's in them and figure out what's going on there? Or is there a better definition?"
61,21,Kat,"Basically, the word 'corpus' comes from the word for 'body.' We're talking about this 'body' of texts. A corpus can be pretty much any size that you want to think of. At the moment, I've worked with corpora that are just 100 texts. I'm working with a corpus that is 1.4 billion words of texts. That's quite big."
61,22,Gretchen,And often they're on a particular theme.
61,23,Kat,"Yeah. I mean, the main thing about a corpus is that there's got to be some principles involved in why you're looking at these particular texts. Yes, it could be a massive one of everything published in English between 1800 and 2020, which would be a lot of things."
61,24,Gretchen,It would be certainly a lot of things.
61,25,Kat,"Or it can be really, really focused. It could be academic writing by students who have completed one year of a language course. Or it could be academic writing by final year linguistics students."
61,26,Gretchen,"But you don't wanna do a pick-and-choose thing where it's like, 'Okay, I'm gonna have this one movie review and this one essay that I wrote when I was 16 and also some emails that I've written -- just the first three emails I saw.'"
61,27,Kat,"Exactly. You don't want to have it composed of lots of little bits here and there. There are general corpora available. You can look at something like the British National Corpus or the Corpus of Contemporary American English. What you'll see is that they're called 'general corpora.' They're meant to give you this general view of the language. That means that someone has thought very carefully about what ought to be included in an overview of the language. You will get things like magazine articles, newspaper articles, letters, reviews, and so on, but it's done in a very, very principled way to try and make it representative of lots of language varieties rather than just, 'Here's an essay I wrote,' and 'Here's a film review,' and 'Here's a letter I wrote to my boss,' and 'Here's a letter I wrote to my best friend.'"
61,28,Gretchen,"But you could, for example, if you had an author who'd donated their archives to a museum, you could say, 'Okay, here's a corpus of everything Virginia Woolf has donated to this archive.' That could still be a corpus."
61,29,Kat,"Absolutely. You could definitely have a corpus that's based around a single author's writing. Even then, you'd probably want to make some distinctions. When you come to store the corpus, you probably do want to break it down into what we call 'sub-corpora.' These are little bits of a corpus within a corpus. If we wanted a corpus of Virginia Woolf's writing, we probably want her published work; we probably want her diaries; and we probably want her letters all stored separately."
61,30,Gretchen,So you could compare what she's doing in different ones.
61,31,Kat,Yeah. It allows us to do just more with it. We could compare diary entries and letters and see does she write in a similar way when she's writing something that's purely for herself versus to other people?
61,32,Gretchen,"Totally. Okay, you were like, 'Corpuses, corpora, they're the future. I'm really into them.' You're also gonna do a PhD."
61,33,Kat,"Yes. One of the nice things about Liverpool is -- again, didn't realise this when I applied -- is that one of the programmers of one of the main tools we use was based there -- someone called Mike Scott. He developed a programme called 'Wordsmith.' You can get it at lexically.net. Basically, he wrote this programme. It's a specialist corpus programme that is designed to look at patterns in language. It means that we can analyse more texts than we would ever be able to analyse manually. We can stick it in there, and we can let the computer do something it's very good at."
61,34,Gretchen,Which is finding things.
61,35,Kat,"Which is finding things and counting things. If, for example, we had a copy of your book, and I said, 'Okay, now go in there and highlight and count every instance of 'the,'' what would you do?"
61,36,Gretchen,"Scream and cry, first of all, because this would be a lot of work, and I don't think I'd wanna do it. Also, I'd probably do a very bad job."
61,37,Kat,"Totally. You would miss instances. You'd lose count. You'd be like, 'Three thousand and twenty -- no, was that 3,027 or 3,026?' It would be just a miserable experience. It would be awful. It would take ages, and it would be a waste of your time."
61,38,Gretchen,"The computer can do that much better than I can. If I have a digital copy of my book, which I do, and I can go in and use the 'find' feature and go Ctrl + F -- 'Find the string T-H-E and show me all of those.' What's the advantage of using specialised corpora software over just Ctrl + F in a text file?"
61,39,Kat,"Ctrl + F doesn't really show you the context. What a corpus programme will do is pull out that string of words, let's say T-H-E, and then it will show these instances in separate lines with some of the words around it. That allows you to look for these bigger patterns and broader patterns across lots of language. We know that 'the' is a determiner, that it usually appears in front of some words."
61,40,Gretchen,"Nouns and adjectives and so on, yeah."
61,41,Kat,"Yeah. When we look at a lot of it at once, we might be able to see particular patterns. It's usually used when we're talking about something that definitely exists, so not something that exists in the abstract. So, 'Hand me the bread' rather than 'Hand me some bread.'"
61,42,Gretchen,Gotcha. And it's sort of a specific quantity or a specific item.
61,43,Kat,"It's a specific item. It's something that definitely exists, and it's there with you."
61,44,Gretchen,And maybe something that's already been mentioned or something like that.
61,45,Kat,"Yeah. Computers are super, super good at counting. They're super, super good at finding and identifying these strings. But they're not very good at the analysis bit. We don't want our computer to do the analysis for us. We want to be very aware of the kind of software and the kind of programming that goes into it that give us the results. Because we as humans are fantastically sensitive to language. That's where the human element comes in. It's why we don't just leave it all to the computers to just do as they will with it."
61,46,Gretchen,It's really a lot more of a partnership between the computer showing you some things and the human making meaning out of that.
61,47,Kat,"Exactly. It's meant to be a partnership where you play to each other's strengths. You let the computer do the bit it's good at, and then you do the bit you're good at."
61,48,Gretchen,"The human side also comes in when you're talking about, okay, how do I decide that this particular set of texts should be the one that I make a corpus of or that I focus on or that I group together compared to the other set of texts."
61,49,Kat,"Oh, yeah. I mean, there're so many corpora that you could build that we haven't even covered yet, that someone could go out there and make a corpus, and it would be something totally unique that someone hasn't really thought of before. One of the problems is, if the data doesn't exist in a machine-readable format, we can't do a lot with it. Something that is digitally native, that is an email, and it was always digital, is much easier to work with. It's much easier to obtain. However, something like newspapers -- well, let's say, pre-2000, pre-1995 newspapers -- super hard to work with."
61,50,Gretchen,Because they all have to be digitised.
61,51,Kat,"They all have to be digitised. They didn't exist in a digital format. Basically, what you have to do is someone has got to scan each newspaper, and then use something called 'optical character recognition' to try and convert the image into text."
61,52,Gretchen,More or less accurately.
61,53,Kat,More or less accurately. The problem is that newspapers are ephemeral. They were never meant to be hoarded and collected.
61,54,Gretchen,"They're on this cheap, thin paper that degrades so fast."
61,55,Kat,"They're on this cheap, thin paper that is -- if you touch an old newspaper, you'd fear that it's going to disintegrate in your hands. The text fades. Also, the printing particularly in the early days wasn't super accurate, so you get all sorts of little ink smudges and blobs. Then the OCR programme has a problem like, 'Is this an L, or is this an I?'"
61,56,Gretchen,"Right. So, if you're trying to search for something --"
61,57,Kat,"Or 'Is this an A, or is this an O, or is this an E with a blob on it, or is this actually a B, a D, a P, etc. that's lost the tail?' It's kind of a nightmare."
61,58,Gretchen,But you've done research on historical newspaper corpora anyway.
61,59,Kat,"Yes, I did. I did my PhD on the media representation of the suffrage movement using newspapers from The Times -- between 1908 and 1914. I just had to make my peace with the fact that the OCR was not going to be super, super accurate. On the other hand, I had 7 million words of this in just my suffrage corpora, so not even the main corpus with everything in it, just the stuff that I'd extracted that was somehow mentioning 'suffrage' or 'suffragists' or 'suffragettes.' I had a lot of data there, and so that made me feel a bit more confident that, if I'm seeing something, it's because it's there rather than because I want to see it."
61,60,Gretchen,It's still some sort of example of a general trend because you have lots of examples of it.
61,61,Kat,Exactly.
61,62,Gretchen,What kinds of things did you see in the suffrage corpus?
61,63,Kat,"Basically, that people were really, really concerned with suffrage direct action. First of all, what I did was read a lot of history. What they tended to work on is stuff produced by suffrage campaigners themselves. They were prolific. You have things like records of meetings. You have meeting minutes. You have their own journals. You have lots of pamphlets. They were writing down their ideas and producing them in pamphlets which could be disseminated. You also had diaries, letters, and other kinds of stuff. They were already working with lots and lots of data, but it was from a particular perspective. What I wanted to find out is how did someone who wasn't involved in the suffrage movement care about them. If you're a reader of the Times which was, at the time of this time period, the paper of record, so it's where people who were influential and often very politically or economically connected read -- you're someone who has no connection with the suffrage movement. You wanna find out about it. You read the Times. What kind of perception do you get from it?"
61,64,Gretchen,What's the Times saying? Are they presenting their demands as reasonable or not reasonable? Are they for or against it is a question that comes to mind immediately.
61,65,Kat,"Yeah, are they broadly supportive or are they broadly hostile? One of the things I found from the historian's research is that there were lots, and lots, and lots of suffrage societies. It wasn't that there was one main campaign group. There were about 50. These different groups, you have different aims, who want the votes for different purposes. We see this enormous diversity. It basically covered the entire political spectrum. It covered different regions. There was a group up in the Orkney Islands and groups down in Cornwall, so pretty much the full breadth of the UK. There were groups with international focuses as well. What the Times does is basically flatten all of this. What you do there is see that the time that the campaigners who campaigned through, basically, trying to introduce legislation and trying to get members of parliament to support bills and did petitions and met up with members of parliament and so on, these tended to be known as 'suffragists.' Then those who preferred direct action -- so things like throwing rocks through windows, sometimes leading huge demonstrations, sometimes doing things like setting fire to boat sheds --"
61,66,Gretchen,"Gosh, okay."
61,67,Kat,Yeah. There was a whole arson campaign that doesn't really get talked about.
61,68,Gretchen,"Hmm, I wonder why?"
61,69,Kat,They tended to be known as 'suffragettes.' What you find in the Times is that they're just all 'suffragists.'
61,70,Gretchen,"So, they're just saying, 'We're not paying attention to the fact that there're differences between these movements or that they don't all agree with each other; they don't all agree with each other's tactics; they don't all have the same goals. We're just gonna lump them all together.'"
61,71,Kat,"Yeah, basically. Here's this enormous, diverse movement, and we're just gonna smoosh it all into the same thing and erase all of these very important differences. Then, if you've smooshed it all into the same thing, if one part of that group does something that you don't like, you can blame all of them for it."
61,72,Gretchen,"Right. So, the people who are setting fire to boat sheds, you can blame them for the people who are meeting with the MPs and trying to lobby behind the scenes and just be like, 'Well, they're all arsonists.'"
61,73,Kat,"What I found is that there was a lot of stuff about direct action. So, lots and lots and lots of stuff about suffrage campaigners disrupting meetings, heckling speakers, as I said, setting fire to boat sheds was a popular one. What I did is I then used corpus techniques here to look at what words were associated, first, with the suffrage terms, found that there were a load of terms associated with direct action, and then looked at those in more detail to work out what kind of actions or what kind of activities they were describing. It ended up being quite useful because different words were used to describe different things. For example, they were quite reluctant to call things 'suffrage violence' because that puts a bit too much on it, but then there were things like 'suffrage incidents' and 'disorder' which seemed a little bit more neutral."
61,74,Gretchen,I see. Okay.
61,75,Kat,"What I found is that there were some terms that were very, very commonly used, and it was mainly because they were vague enough to cover a lot of things."
61,76,Gretchen,"I mean, I guess that's still true in the modern day. Like if you're gonna call something a 'riot,' that's committing to something, whereas if you say, 'It's a march,' well, are you taking sides for against for or against the march? There was just some people marching. Or it was a 'protest.' There're these terms that the media can use to shape public perception of what's going on."
61,77,Kat,"And they can make it sound worse than it is as well. Again, I think some of the things that I found you can see today if you look at different protest movements. So, things like Black Lives Matter, there is this spectre of the Black Lives Matter act that's been created that bears very, very little resemble to who the activists actually are."
61,78,Gretchen,"It's also a big, diverse group that has lots of different people's agendas and lots of different ways of trying to accomplish things."
61,79,Kat,"Absolutely. It's a big, diverse movement and, again, that diversity is not necessarily recognised."
61,80,Gretchen,"So, that was your dissertation -- all about suffrage movements. What was the trajectory like to get from there to where you are now?"
61,81,Kat,"As some people probably know, an academic job is pretty hard to come by."
61,82,Gretchen,"Yes, indeed."
61,83,Kat,"I spent a lot of time working in one university for a semester, another university for a year, and so on. Basically, what I had to do was diversify my own teaching. As a PhD student or as a PhD scholar, you end up being very, very focused on your particular area of expertise, and you pretty much end up being the world or a leading expert in it."
61,84,Gretchen,In this very narrow area.
61,85,Kat,"It often is a super narrow area. But, unfortunately, unless you're extremely lucky, most universities don't have room in their budget to employ someone who can only teach on their super narrow area."
61,86,Gretchen,"You can't teach, like, four different courses on corpus linguistics of the early suffrage movement."
61,87,Kat,"Exactly. I couldn't teach four different courses on the corpus linguistics of even newspaper texts -- even broadening that out a bit. If I was lucky, I could teach a corpus linguistics module. But even then, that would be covering areas of corpus linguistics that I don't really do a lot of."
61,88,Gretchen,"And sometimes they might also want you to, say, 'Hey, can you just teach morphology or something for us?'"
61,89,Kat,"Which happens. At one point, it was like, 'Hey, we've employed you to do this course on stylistics,' which is the study of literary texts using linguistic approaches, 'Can you also teach history of English?' And I was like, 'Sure. Guess I can.' Basically, I ended up kind of like an hourglass where, as an undergraduate, you do a lot of different things, and you gradually narrow your focus until you get to the PhD, and then I had to broaden my focus again and become comfortable teaching in everything to do with language and use, I guess. I did teach a first-year grammar module, which was a bit hair-raising. It was like, 'Oh, god, I haven't done this since I was an undergraduate myself.'"
61,90,Gretchen,"But you do end up with these generalisable research skills where you can be like, 'Oh, even if I need to go spend a month brushing up on this, at least I am now good at reading academic texts.'"
61,91,Kat,"Yeah, you end up being very good at being able to identify key texts in an area and then following the literature, basically, so following the citation trail and just going like, 'Okay, well, they seem to be drawing on this work, and that looks useful, so I'll go off and read it.' 'Okay, so this work has been used in this way by someone else, and that seems interesting, I'll go off and read it.' You end up having skills to teach yourself stuff. Also, it's been really good for my own research because I think we can get a bit too narrow in scope. Suddenly teaching stuff like stylistics and analysing narrative and looking at sociolinguistics and so on has been really informative for my own work. I'm able to bring in these other things."
61,92,Gretchen,"That's really fun. I think I definitely through a similar process of becoming more broad when I was leaving grad school and being like, okay, if I'm gonna do general interest pop linguistics, I can be interested in any sub-field of linguistics because I might need to explain it to somebody who's never heard of it."
61,93,Kat,Isn't it great? It's so much fun!
61,94,Gretchen,You can draw these really fun connections.
61,95,Kat,"Also, it just all feeds into what you're doing and what you're about. It makes you a better linguist if you are familiar with more of these areas."
61,96,Gretchen,Do you have another research project that you're working on at the moment?
61,97,Kat,"Yeah, basically my co-investigator or partner in crime went to me and said, 'Hey, Kat. I've just got my hands on 1.4 billion words of online erotica.' And they were like, 'Do you want to have a play with this?' And I was like, 'Of course!' Because how can you say no to an offer like that, right?"
61,98,Gretchen,It's a huge corpus. That is very interesting to analyse and probably not a lot of people have done it.
61,99,Kat,"It's, again, one of these texts that people feel kind of like, 'Ooo, well, it's not literary,' or it's not proper in some way. It's not a formal text genre. There's something a bit underworld about it. We were just like, 'Yeah, this sounds great.'"
61,100,Gretchen,I know people who are analysing fanfiction. I guess you could sort of think of this as not that dissimilar of a genre in the sense that it's open contribution from anybody. People are doing stuff -- maybe they're responding to comments and doing certain things. You probably end up with certain tropes.
61,101,Kat,"It's been really interesting going to conferences because other people are doing normal, sensible things like looking at academic writing or looking at novels or looking at general speech, and there we are going like, 'Yep, erotica.' But it's also really interesting to use it as a lens of what do these texts say about human interactions."
61,102,Gretchen,What have you found about human interactions?
61,103,Kat,"I've been doing some work on consent because the classics of the more sociolinguistic oriented work -- and this is where teaching in that area has been super helpful -- is that people say 'No' in various complicated ways. If we want to refuse something, it's a dis-preferred response. That means that it's not the response that the person who's asking necessarily wants. That means we usually have to be more elaborate about it."
61,104,Gretchen,"If I say something like, 'Hey, Kat, do you wanna get coffee later?'"
61,105,Kat,"And I couldn't, I'd be like, 'I'm so sorry. I'd love to, but this other thing has come up, and I really have to go to that.'"
61,106,Gretchen,"'Unfortunately, I'm allergic to coffee, and also my parrot needs me at home,' and all of these things."
61,107,Kat,Exactly. We feel that we've got to give a much fuller explanation.
61,108,Gretchen,"Whereas if I say, 'Do you wanna get coffee?' and you're like, 'Yeah, great. What time?' you can make this very fast, short, affirmative response because that's the preferred response in that scenario."
61,109,Kat,"And if you said, 'Do wanna go for a coffee?' and I said, 'No,' you'd probably feel a bit -- pretty bad about that."
61,110,Gretchen,'Does Kat hate me?'
61,111,Kat,"Exactly. These more elaborate responses are a way of smoothing over a social interaction by making our listener feel, 'Okay, no, this person does still like you. They just can't go right now.'"
61,112,Gretchen,"'It's not that they don't want to, it's just that they can't.' But then even if you don't want to, you sometimes feel this need to provide a reason why you can't because, like, if someone invites me for dinner, and I really don't like them, I might be like, 'Oh, no, I can't. I've got something else going on that night,' even if the other thing I have going on is staying home and reading my book because I don't want them to think I hate them."
61,113,Kat,"That's something that we find in discussions of sexual consent, that people are very reluctant to give a 'No' where it's 'I don't want to' because that risks either hurting someone that we care about or potentially, if we're in a no-so-good situation, exposes us to violence. Generally, we see these nos as being quite elaborate and often about 'I can't do something' rather than 'I don't want to do something.'"
61,114,Gretchen,"Like, 'No, I can't come up to your apartment for a coffee because I've got to go home. My parrot will be expecting me' sort of thing."
61,115,Kat,"Or even, 'I don't want to have sex. I've got a headache. I'm feeling really gruff. I just don't feel up for it.' It's an 'I can't' rather than 'I don't want to.' One of the things that we've seen is stuff to do with use of condoms. In particular, if someone says, 'I don't have a condom,' what are they doing with that?"
61,116,Gretchen,"That could be a way of saying, 'It's not that I don't want to, it's just that I can't.'"
61,117,Kat,"Exactly. Basically, if someone's saying, 'I don't have a condom,' that could be a 'Whoops! Love to, just can't. It's just not physically possible for me to do this.' We'd expect that to be one of the soft nos. But are people interpreting that as a no?"
61,118,Gretchen,"Right. Or are they interpreting that as, 'Oh, it's okay, I'll just go down to the corner store and buy one, and then we can proceed.'"
61,119,Kat,"Yeah. One of the things I was interested in is the previous academic work on it which does suggest that people do say no and mean it by saying, 'I don't have a condom,' and that's just, 'I don't want you to go and find one. I don't want you pop to the corner shop and buy a pack. I'm trying to say no in a way that isn't going to hurt you or offend you.'"
61,120,Gretchen,"Right. It's the same sort of, 'Oh, I can't go for a walk, I don't have a jacket,' 'I don't have the right shoes,' the sort of, 'I lack the necessarily equipment for this activity."
61,121,Kat,"Or indeed, 'Oh, I can't. I've not had enough caffeine today.' It's a problem I could fix."
61,122,Gretchen,You could just have another coffee.
61,123,Kat,"I don't wanna fix it though. We're interested in these texts. What happens when someone says, 'I don't have a condom,' and what happens after that? What kind of actions does it lead to? Basically, this is where I use my corpus programme to look for every instance of the word 'condom' in a set of these texts. Computer was really good at this. Gold star computer -- it was great. Then I had to read them, and I had to work through a decision tree of possible outcomes and see, basically, what happens. Do you wanna guess what happens?"
61,124,Gretchen,"Well, you know, I think there might be a bit of a confound from the fact that this is something that's marketed or supposed to be online erotica. If the scene just ends as you would hope that it might end in real life by saying, 'Oh, well, okay, maybe next time. Have a nice night,' the person who's reading this and the particular genre is like -- you know, it's like if you're reading a mystery novel, and you don't find out who did it, you're disappointed."
61,125,Kat,"Lovely analysis of genre there. [Laughter] What happened is that someone would say, 'I don't have a condom,' and then the other person would fix the problem in some way. Either 'That's fine. I've got some,' or 'Don't worry, we can borrow my ex-boyfriend's,' or 'my mom's,' or 'my sister's.'"
61,126,Gretchen,I see.
61,127,Kat,"Or 'Don't worry, I'm an elf under the age of 99, and, therefore, it's okay. Can't get pregnant.'"
61,128,Gretchen,Love a fantasy scenario.
61,129,Kat,"Honestly, that one was one of my favourites. I think I saved that story just to be like, 'They have thought about it, and I appreciate that.'"
61,130,Gretchen,"'Here are some magical elves that don't get STIs.' Great, great."
61,131,Kat,"Awesome. Of course, the biggest category was, 'Oh, that's fine. I'm on birth control,' or 'That's fine, let's just do it anyway.'"
61,132,Gretchen,"Right. Because, again, we have the confounds of the genre."
61,133,Kat,"We have expectations here. Also, there's something going on there about -- it's not quite allowed. There's something a little bit naughty, a little bit --"
61,134,Gretchen,Taboo about -- yeah.
61,135,Kat,"-- risky about that. There's something, yeah, a bit taboo about that. What we found is that what the sociolinguistics were saying about nos didn't quite apply to what was happening in these texts. It leads us to a really interesting question about how do people read these texts."
61,136,Gretchen,"Is this acting out a fantasy that you wouldn't do in real life which is, okay, it would be risky to not have a condom with a random stranger that you just met or something like that, but if it's just written as words on a screen, then that's a way of thinking about that that's not actually real? Or is this somewhere where people are actually getting the idea that it would be fine to do this in real life?"
61,137,Kat,"Exactly. Does it exist in the world of the texts where, perhaps, some of these rules and boundaries and things don't exist in the same way? You can have unprotected sex without any consequences, and that's just how it works in this imaginative world. That's fine. The problem is -- are people reading these as reflections on real life, and are they getting their knowledge from this?"
61,138,Gretchen,"I mean, this sounds like a good question for sex educators."
61,139,Kat,That's the next step of our research project that we want to start talking to sex educators and writers of similar texts and just kind of work out what's happening when you write these texts -- what's happening when you read these texts. One of the things is that we don't necessarily expect the writers to have actually experienced the scenarios that they write about.
61,140,Gretchen,"I mean, I think that the 99-year-old elf is probably unlikely, yes."
61,141,Kat,"Oh, I don't know. Who knows? It's a big, wide world out there. [Laughter]"
61,142,Gretchen,I haven't met all of the people in the world. Maybe some of them are elves.
61,143,Kat,"I mean, I am an empiricist. It's like, when you write these, are you writing about things you've actually done; are you writing about things that you'd like to do but haven't had the opportunity to do so; or are you writing about things that you find erotic, but if someone said, 'I can make that fantasy come true today,' you'd be like, 'Oh, no, I don't actually want to do this'?"
61,144,Gretchen,"Because people do read about a lot of things that are fantastic. I mean, you can read about elves in a non-erotica context as well. You can read about murder mysteries and not wanna be committing murder. There's lots of things that people do read about that are very much in the realm of the fantastic."
61,145,Kat,"There's a whole category on this in our texts that is just about fantasy. There's another section that is about horror. People have fantasies about aliens and about werewolves and all sorts of things that, if these were actually capable of being carried out, I think we would've heard something about the sheer number of aliens and vampires and werewolves roaming the world."
61,146,Gretchen,"And yet, you can see, if you're reading about aliens and vampires and werewolves in other genres, and they do the polite fade to black, you might think, 'You know what? What if that scene was written about?'"
61,147,Kat,There's something about people just having permission to imagine things -- sometimes having permission to imagine things that they can't carry out.
61,148,Gretchen,"So, we'll link to your papers that you've written about various aspects of corpus linguistics and things like that. Is there anything else you'd like to point people to when it comes to work that you're interested in?"
61,149,Kat,"There's a number of people who are doing work on, particularly, queer linguistics that is really, really interesting. One of the things that my co-investigator Alon and I have found really useful is looking at people who are looking at sex advice because it's kind of the other side of the coin to what we're doing. We're looking at how people articulate sexual identities and experiences and desires, and then sex advice columns do something different. They're kind of like, 'What do you want to do? This is how you could go about it.' I particularly like Aimee Bailey's work on homonormativity in queer women's media because she started out looking at sex advice columns for queer, bi, and lesbian women's websites, and then was increasingly interested in, okay, what are they doing about, say, bi women who may have sexual experiences and desires and so on with people of different genders, and how do we make room for these desires and experiences and so on in a community focused on women who have sex with women."
61,150,Gretchen,The word 'homonormativity' suggests that maybe they're not making a lot of space for this?
61,151,Kat,"Yeah. It's kind of, 'How do we establish this homonormativity?' which is not just about sexual behaviours but also cultural identities as well. How do we have this unified queer woman identity that isn't too troubled by the existence of bisexual women."
61,152,Gretchen,That sounds neat.
61,153,Kat,"It's really cool stuff. Aimee is a relatively new PhD graduate, and I'm just so interested in what she does next."
61,154,Gretchen,"Awesome! We'll link to that as well. Finally, if you could leave people knowing one thing about linguistics, what would it be?"
61,155,Kat,"I think you can tell from what I've been saying that I am basically all over the place in terms of research interests and experiences and so on. I think that that's the great joy of linguistics that it lets you explore absolutely anything you want from anthropology to neuroscience. If you want to get into ethnography, there's so much linguistic work making use of that. If you want to look at how people's language goes wrong, or how people acquire language, you can get into some really, really scientific areas where you are doing things like MRI scans and things. There're just so many applications for it. It has applications for everything involving human knowledge that somehow involves communication. I think that's just so exciting and so magical about linguistics. [Music]"

62,9,Lauren,"I have a quiz for you, Gretchen."
62,10,Gretchen,Okay.
62,11,Lauren,Which is warmer -- 'tepid' or 'lukewarm'?
62,12,Gretchen,"I think of both of these as characteristics that apply to water. I think lukewarm water feels a little bit warmer to me. But they're both that kind of, you know, room-temperature-a-little-bit-warmer, you know, the temperature of water they use to make yeast go with bread. Yeah, do you have a strong opinion about these?"
62,13,Lauren,"I thought that I would, and I just cannot fix in my mind which one should be warmer. Maybe 'lukewarm,' but I think it's possibly because I don't know what 'leuk' means. It is a lost Old English word that means 'tepid.' So, even etymologically, we're going in circles here. I don't have a sense of how they compare to each other."
62,14,Gretchen,"When I was a kid, I definitely knew a kid called 'Luke,' and I was like, 'Oh, it's the type of water that Luke likes,' like for his bath or something."
62,15,Lauren,Completely different history of those two words but understandable that you would come to that very specific folk history.
62,16,Gretchen,"I mean, kids, right? This is the place that spurious etymologies are made of. Whereas I don't think I encountered 'tepid' until I was a bit older."
62,17,Lauren,"We have a clear sense of how 'hot' and 'cold' relate to each other and that 'tepid' and 'lukewarm' are somewhere in the middle, but things get a little bit fuzzy in that middle space."
62,18,Gretchen,They totally do. There're actually also cross-linguistic differences in terms of how we carve up the temperature space. I spent a long time when I was learning French trying to figure out what their word for 'warm' was.
62,19,Lauren,Is there one?
62,20,Gretchen,"The answer is there isn't really one. You can say for warm water, if you're directly contrasting it with hot water, 'de l'eau tiède,' which is really more like 'lukewarm' or 'tepid' water. You can't say that of the weather. You can't say that of other types of things. You just talk about the weather being 'chaud,' being 'hot.' The first day of spring, you're like, 'Oh, it's finally above 0. Oh, it's so hot out,' which you can say in English, right. Like, 'Oh, it's the first day of warm weather after a long period of time,' you can be like, 'Oh, it's so hot.'"
62,21,Lauren,I think it's just worth saying that your idea of what counts as hot weather coming out of a Canadian winter and my idea of hot weather in the middle of an Australian summer is relevant and contextual.
62,22,Gretchen,"To be fair, my idea of what counts as hot in my April versus in my July is also extremely different."
62,23,Lauren,These things are relative. I assume this means that because of context French people can actually perceive the difference between a pleasantly warm day and an unpleasantly over-hot day.
62,24,Gretchen,"Yeah. I mean, it's not like they're confused about whether you need to wear a sweater when it's 10 degrees versus 30 degrees. Obviously, they know. But the same word that's used for the whole span of warmer-than-I-would've-expected or hot-in-some-way-that's-significant-to-me. French does have a word -- in fact, several words -- for 'cool' in the temperature sense. 'Frais' is 'cool.' Also, 'frette' is 'cool,' which is a Quebec word. Then 'froid' is properly 'cold.' It was weird to me that in English you have this symmetrical scale where it has one mid-point term on each side of perceptual zero, which isn't actually zero degrees, but it's unremarkable temperature. Then you have slightly more and less than remarkable, and then a lot more or less than remarkable. The weirdest thing for me was having this lack of symmetry on the scale. But as it happens, this is a language family thing. Having words for 'warm' and 'hot' is common in Balto-Slavic languages and Germanic languages -- of course, English is a Germanic language. But in Romance languages -- French 'chaude,' Spanish 'caliente,' and Latin 'calidus,' and then also in Greek 'thermos,' which you may recognise as the origin of 'thermometer' and other words -- one word covers both."
62,25,Lauren,"I didn't realise it had such a time depth to it. Interesting. English has more points on the scale for warmth than French does, but it's not necessarily a single scale. We treat warm water and hot water the same way we treat warm weather and hot weather, but when I was learning Nepali, I had to learn the difference when you use the word for 'hot' that refers to weather and the word for 'hot' that refers to water and beverages. There's 'gharmi,' which is warm weather, and then 'tato,' which is warm or hot for if you want your water to be hot."
62,26,Gretchen,Is this for food as well? Does that go with the beverages?
62,27,Lauren,"Food goes with beverages. I remember it very clearly in the context of beverages because the non-weather word for 'cold' is 'chiso.' You can actually ask for a 'chiso,' and you'll get a canned beverage."
62,28,Gretchen,"So, like a cold drink versus a hot drink like tea or something?"
62,29,Lauren,Yeah.
62,30,Gretchen,"I guess, like, English has, 'I wanna a cold one,' which is used for beer."
62,31,Lauren,Similar vibes but completely different words used for these two different heat scales.
62,32,Gretchen,"That's interesting. When I was looking up the etymology for 'cold,' which is very old, goes back to Proto-Indo European, Etymonline, interestingly -- because it doesn't normally have entries about Japanese -- but it points out that Japanese has two words for 'cold' as well. 'Samui' for coldness in the atmosphere or environment, and 'tsumetai' for things which are cold to touch, which is also used in the figurative sense for personalities and behaviours."
62,33,Lauren,Cool. It's more cool than 'cool.' It's 'cold' as a fact. That does not work. 'Cool' has elevated itself out of the scale of temperatures.
62,34,Gretchen,"That's something else that I had to get used to as a teenager learning French that I couldn't use the word for 'cool,' 'frais,' to mean 'That's neat. That's nifty. That's popular.' There are words for these things in French, but they aren't weather words. That actually reminds me of another very obscure English word that's used specifically to differentiate between different types of heat scales. This is the word 'apricity.'"
62,35,Lauren,I do not know this word. I don't even have a sense of it. Can I make one up and see how close I get?
62,36,Gretchen,Go ahead.
62,37,Lauren,Is it a temperature word that means one of those perfectly middle-of-the-transition-of-seasons that captures the sense of a still April morning?
62,38,Gretchen,"It is a word that's found in April, but it specifically refers to the warmth of sunlight on the skin or on a surface as distinct from the warmth of the air. You can see that April is the kind of month that has some apricity. Whether you're in the Northern or Southern hemisphere, April and October are those transitional temperature months where it's kind of chilly, but you can stand at the window and feel the warmth, and then if you open the window, you're like, 'Oh, actually it's cold.' Or you can be going for a walk and be like, 'Oh, the sun feels so warm on my skin, but I'm still wearing a coat.'"
62,39,Lauren,I'm absolutely going to take that into my active vocabulary. That's a dimension of warmth I had never even had a specific word for before.
62,40,Gretchen,"Isn't it a charming word? I mean, to be fair, I think it is one of those philosopher words that was coined as a wouldn't-it-be-great-if-there-was-a-distinction-for-this. I like it, and I've adopted it, too."
62,41,Lauren,Excellent. That's how we make these distinctions happen.
62,42,Gretchen,Absolutely. Join the new apricity club.
62,43,Lauren,"We can plot out 'warm,' 'hot,' 'cold,' 'very cold,' 'chilly,' 'mild' along a line. We have temperatures we associate with them. Although, as we've already said, those temperatures can be context and weather system dependent."
62,44,Gretchen,"I think it's worth pointing out that we can plot 'warm' and 'cold' and 'hot' on a line not just because we have thermometers. People were doing this before thermometers. These words are all older than the scientific measurement of temperature, which is around 500 years old. One of the first thermoscopes, which was a precursor to the thermometer, was developed by the Italian inventor Galileo Galilei in the 1500s. Words for 'hot' and 'cold' are much older than that."
62,45,Lauren,We didn't start really feeling weather just because we could assign absolute value numbers to the amount of weather or warmth that we felt.
62,46,Gretchen,We have this intuitive sense. Even a kid who hasn't learned numbers or hasn't learned how to read a thermometer yet can still feel a difference between cold and warm or hot.
62,47,Lauren,"So far, we've been talking about temperature for which we have this fixed, absolute numerical scale, but we also have these words that we can affix to parts of that scale. There are also some things that sit on a scale even if we don't have absolute, fixed quantities that we can attach to them, which means that I get to talk about one of my favourite experiments that I run in my semantics tutorials. Unfortunately, we don't have 30 of us here and, unfortunately, I don't have a big bag of lollies or confectionary, which is what I normally start this class with."
62,48,Gretchen,Where's my candy?
62,49,Lauren,"Gretchen, I'm very sorry."
62,50,Gretchen,You need to send me my candy over the internet.
62,51,Lauren,"I come in with a bag of confectionary, and I put people into groups and ask one group of people to all take 'a couple' of lollies. I ask the next group to take 'a few' lollies. And I ask the next group to take 'some' lollies. Then we count how many of the individual items people felt comfortable taking from the bag. Even though these are all kind of vague words -- we might have a sense of them in some contexts -- there's variation in how many people take depending on the instructions they've been given. Some people will have a very literal interpretation of 'a couple' and just take two. Others will be like, well, it's a giant bag of small M&Ms, so they might take three or four. People who take a few -- some will take three, some will take four or five. Then when people are given the instruction to take 'some,' they might take six or seven -- depending, of course, on monitoring other people because it's not actually an experiment. It's a social experiment in a tutorial."
62,52,Gretchen,"It's not a randomised, controlled trial."
62,53,Lauren,"We talk about the fact that this bag of candy has a very specific volume, and they have a specific size. If I came in with boxes of cupcakes, that might radically alter how many they take. If we were talking about stars in the sky, when there's so many teeny tiny stars, 'a few stars' might be a section of the galaxy with hundreds of stars in it, which is more than you would feel comfortable taking candy from a bag."
62,54,Gretchen,"Yeah. Because some people will get very dogmatic about, like, 'a few' always means three or four. It does in many physical contexts. If I say, 'I want a few eggs,' that probably does mean three or four eggs. But if you have a stadium that seats 10,000 people or 100,000 people, and only 1,000 people show up, you could look out at that stadium and say, 'Only a few people are here.'"
62,55,Lauren,That is a lot of eggs.
62,56,Gretchen,"It's just a lot of eggs. Maybe if you have a massive egg factory, and you normally process thousands and thousands of eggs a day, then, you know, 'Oh, there's only 100 today. What happened to all the eggs? There's only a few here.' It really depends on what your baseline level expectation is for the exact numerical value. But 'a few' means 'not very many' in the context of the whole potential amount."
62,57,Lauren,"We can still plot it on a scale with 'a couple' where 'a few' tends to be more than 'a couple.' Thinking about the relationship between these terms in a scale even though the actual numbers aren't always fixed is more useful for understanding the semantic difference between them than necessarily fixating on that very dogmatic, it-always-means-two kind of approach. Not everything that we conceptualise as sitting on a scale has to have some absolute, scientific unit type numerical value associated with it."
62,58,Gretchen,"Numbers are, again, a relative newcomer to the group and expectation level ways that humans have been conceiving of quantities for a much longer period of time. It's neat that words like 'a couple' and 'a few' and 'some' pay attention to a logarithmic scale rather than to a strict numerical scale because it's based on your expectations."
62,59,Lauren,"In some ways, that brings us to another dimension of the scale which is how specific you're being. A word like 'a few' or 'a couple' is less specific than saying '10 eggs' or '10 lollies' or '10 stars.' Talking in those less specific, less numerical terms implies in a way that you don't know or you don't have any reason to pay attention to the specific number."
62,60,Gretchen,"Whereas being really precise can say, okay, here's a more specific way of naming something. If you describe a person as 'big' or 'tall,' you can be like, okay, well, that could be a pretty large range of heights, but say they're above six feet or something, whereas if you describe someone as 'This person is six feet tall,' or if you describe someone as 'This person is exactly two metres and eleven centimetres and one millimetre tall,' yeah, you can be more and more specific. I think if somebody says, 'I'm five foot eleven and three quarters,' you're like, 'Okay, you're really making a lot of points here not to say that you're six feet tall because you don't wanna claim that extra quarter inch or something.'"
62,61,Lauren,"I also know that I get called 'tall' when I'm in countries like Nepal because, again, a word like 'tall' is very relative. But in the context of my family or professional basketball players, I am in no way tall. Then, specific heights are actually more informative depending on the context that you're in."
62,62,Gretchen,"It depends on, again, if you're looking for the social context of being tall because everyone else around you is much taller or much shorter versus the literal context of 'Will you fit through this doorway without banging your head?' or 'You must be this tall to ride the ride at the amusement park.'"
62,63,Lauren,"We can even more completely beyond quantity and still have these scales that have all these implications that come with them. If I said, 'I believe that Gretchen has some confectionary she's not telling me about' versus 'I know that Gretchen has some confectionary she's not telling me about,' there's very different weights to how certain I am about exactly what lollies you're keeping from me."
62,64,Gretchen,"Yeah, if you believe I have a secret chocolate stash versus if you know I have a secret chocolate stash, one of those is a bit more of an accusation."
62,65,Lauren,"Yeah, because I have more certainty -- I have some amount of evidence, I guess -- of this secret stash. We can plot words like 'I believe' and 'I think' and 'I know' relative to each other."
62,66,Gretchen,Or with something like 'I wonder.' You could even go weaker than that. 'I suppose that you have a secret chocolate stash.' That's really much more doubtful. You can have this scale of certitude.
62,67,Lauren,"We have these as words in English, but in languages like Yolmo, where I work with the evidential system of the language, the grammar of the language has baked in 'I saw that this thing happened' or 'I was told that this thing happened' or 'I know from my own personal experience of it that this thing happened.' A lot of work on evidentiality puts these different types of evidence that you have a scale. A lot of the scales try and be really absolute about it. Like, knowing because you saw something is definitely higher than knowing because someone told you. I like thinking about things in relative context. I think you telling me something about your own personal experience is probably a higher value of knowledge than me seeing and concocting some story about something in terms of your personal experience of it."
62,68,Gretchen,"If I tell you that I'm hungry, that's probably better information than if you just see me eating something because maybe I'm eating it because I'm bored or I know I'm gonna be hungry later, so I might as well just finish this, or something like that."
62,69,Lauren,"Even for these non-quantity-based scales, as always, context -- so important."
62,70,Gretchen,"Another scale that I hadn't really thought about until I saw the linguist Elizabeth Pankratz tweeted about it on Twitter is the idea of using various kinds of smiley-face emoji as a scale of precision or a scale of relevance here. There's a slightly smiling face emoji which is just two dots and a little curve for the mouth. In theory, it should be kind of like a smiley-face. This should be an emoji you can just use to convey a smile. But in practice, it doesn't get used as much as the more elaborate smiling faces where the eyes are doing something, or there's tears of joy, or the mouth is doing something bigger, or something like that."
62,71,Lauren,"There are more smiling face emoji than I think people realise until they go in and have to pick one. Then suddenly they have this scale of how happy am I -- am I eyes closed, full mouth grin, big teeth happy? It's hard to put yourself on a scale, which makes me think that maybe that's why face with tears of joy became so useful because people are like, 'I can't choose between all these different smiles. I'll just go for the one that is so obviously delighted by the situation.'"
62,72,Gretchen,"You can spot it among all the other ones that have subtle differences in the mouths and cheeks and, especially on different platforms, you don't necessarily know which one someone else has used if you wanna mirror theirs, whereas face with tears of joy -- it always has those tear-shaped dots in the corner, so it has a relatively distinctive look on different platforms."
62,73,Lauren,"You never get this problem with emoticons because you have the, like, right bracket parenthese canonical smile, and then you have the capital D big grin :D. That's it. You have so much less space to move in. I think that's why the classic smiling emoticon still feels fine in a way that the classic smiling smiley-face emoji feels underwhelming."
62,74,Gretchen,"Right. Maybe people are more reliable to draw this inference of, okay, you didn't use the fancier smiling face, so you must've meant that you didn't actually feel as positive as you might have when there's so many obvious alternatives of the more elaborate emoji that you could be using, whereas because it's harder to create more elaborate smiling faces -- I mean, you do have :D, or several parentheses :))), or something like that."
62,75,Lauren,This is true.
62,76,Gretchen,It's not as obvious all of the different versions you could be doing instead.
62,77,Lauren,"Whether it's emoji or temperature or eggs, one of the things that these scales all seem to have in common is that where you choose to put yourself on the scale creates these implications."
62,78,Gretchen,"What's interesting about a statement like, 'The coffee is warm,' is that I could follow it up with a more precise statement, a more extreme statement. I could say, 'The coffee is warm. In fact, it's hot.' That comes across as providing more precise information. It's not a weird contradiction. If I said, 'The coffee is warm. In fact, it's iced,' you'd be like, 'Wait a second. No. Not both of those things are possible.' Or if I said, 'The coffee is in a red cup. In fact, it's in a blue cup,' you'd be like, 'No. No, no, no. You can't just -- no.' But I can do that with 'The coffee is warm. In fact, it's hot' even though, normally speaking, if I say something like, 'The coffee is warm,' you would assume that I'm trying to imply that it's not hot. I can actually go in and cancel that assumption or that implicature by providing more precise information. That's this very specific relationship that these types of meanings that are on a scale have. The same thing with something like 'believe' versus 'know.' I can say, 'I believe Jane has a secret chocolate stash. In fact, I know she does,' even though normally, 'I believe Jane has a secret chocolate stash' just implies that I don't actually know for a fact. I can then go in, and I cancel that implicature by saying, 'No, no, no, I actually do know this.'"
62,79,Lauren,"But it doesn't work in the opposite direction. I can't say, 'I know Jane has a secret chocolate stash,' and people are like, 'Oh, how do you know?' Like, 'Well, because I believe that she does' is a case suddenly falling apart."
62,80,Gretchen,"Exactly. There are other words that actually exist on a scale of specificity when you think about it. If I say, 'I'm gonna go to the movies with John or Bill,' I could follow that with 'In fact, I'm gonna go with both of them.' But the initial statement seems to imply I'll go to the movies with either John or Bill but not both of them. I can cancel that by saying, 'Oh, yeah, in fact, I'm actually gonna do it this way.' It does seem to imply not both of them because if I'd known that I was gonna go with both of them, I could've just said 'and.' We have a word 'and.' It's perfectly good at doing that thing. If I had known that 'and' was likely to be true, I could've said that. That's why we have this word 'and/or' where people are like, I know that normally 'or' could include 'and,' but it probably doesn't, so I wanna be a little bit stronger and insert something else that's in between these two to really make it obvious that it could be 'and' even though, technically, it would still be true if I had said, 'I'll go with John or Bill, and both of them were free, so I went with both of them.' It also creates that scale where the other members of the scale or the more specific members of that scale aren't implied even though they could show up along the way."
62,81,Lauren,We use these implied contextual pieces of information all the time. It's so hard to break our minds out of the way that these implications are sitting along a scale that sometimes it can be hard to wrap your head around those examples until you break them out into a specific context like that.
62,82,Gretchen,"Another example of how these implicatures are so ingrained is if you have a statement like, 'I ate some of the cookies.' We can set up a scenario where we've got a cookie jar, and I go in, and I say, 'Oh, well, I've eaten some of the cookies, so they won't all be left.' And then you open up the jar, and you're like, 'You ate all of them.' I'm like, 'Well, you know, I ate some. In fact, I ate all of them.' Again, there isn't a contradiction here the way there would be if you did it in the inverse. Like, 'I ate all the cookies. In fact, I ate some of them.' You're like, 'Wait.'"
62,83,Lauren,'Why are there still some left? I'm very confused.'
62,84,Gretchen,"That one doesn't work. But this order -- 'I ate some. In fact, I ate all' -- that is just cancelling an implicature. It's not actually falsifying the actual thing that you said."
62,85,Lauren,"I always feel like this is the point where linguists and legal scholars both get excited because it's just like, 'Oh, yes. The sum defence in cookie taking.'"
62,86,Gretchen,"I think this is one of the things that lawyers get trained to do is paying attention to the actual stated information even though normally when we talk to each other all of these levels of implicature do come around for the ride. There is a really fun version of this that you can do with numbers. My favourite example of this is this gif which I have analysed before for linguistic purposes because I really like this gif. It also shows up in Crash Course Linguistics, so I love this example so much. There's a gif that has this vast sea of ducks. They're on a street in China for reasons that are not quite clear to me. This is a news broadcast that's clearly like, 'There're all these ducks here. What the heck's going on?' This gif showed up on Tumblr. Somebody had commented under it, 'Look at all these ducks. There are at least 10.'"
62,87,Lauren,"[Laughs] You have actually talked about it on the show before as well, but it is such a great example of implicature and, specifically, of this number-based implicature. It makes me laugh every time."
62,88,Gretchen,"Somebody replied on Tumblr saying, 'Well, you're not wrong.' Because technically speaking, you know, here's probably thousands of ducks is at least 10 ducks. It's just that this is so uninformative. It so clearly implies that you don't know a more specific number when you very clearly do know a more specific number if you're looking at this gif. It's this tension between the implied meeting and the literal meaning that creates the humour there."
62,89,Lauren,Un-useful to the point of comedy. A lot of comedy plays with this implied meaning and twists it in ways that go against our usual expectations of how the implicature rolls out.
62,90,Gretchen,"There's another example of this from the BBC radio comedy Cabin Pressure, which I'm an enormous fan of. One of the characters who's a little bit not very good at implicatures says, 'I can read people like a book.' Another character says, 'Have you ever read a book, Arthur?' And Arthur says, 'Yes, actually, White Fang. Twice.'"
62,91,Lauren,"I thought that was just a generic use of a book, and Arthur is treating it as an actual, canonical number."
62,92,Gretchen,"Right. Generally, people would expect, you know, 'Have you read a book?' to be answered in the tens or the hundreds or maybe the thousands. Most people who've read a book have read many books. But Arthur's like, 'Yeah, here's the book that I have read.' In a different context, you can use this 'a whatever' can potentially mean 'a single one' or can potentially mean 'more than one' and, pragmatically, it still makes sense. If you say, for example, 'If you have a child, you can take advantage of our complimentary day care service.' And then someone could say, 'Oh, yes, I have a child.' And somebody could say, 'I have two children.' That's fine. Normally, you wouldn't necessarily say that one child implies that you might also have two, but in the context of 'Do you wanna take advantage of the complementary day care service?', it's not suddenly that you have two children, and it doesn't work for you anymore."
62,93,Lauren,"Arthur isn't the only person that can struggle with how things fit on a scale. This is something that children take quite a while to get their heads around as well, especially with those words that we were talking about earlier like 'some' or 'a few' that are very much context dependent."
62,94,Gretchen,"There's a really cute experiment testing kids on what kinds of things they can infer from context and from what's being said. They have some kids, and they have some plates of cookies. In one case, they'll have a researcher or a puppet or something say, 'I ate the sugar cookies.' From that, the four- and five-year-olds do understand that that person is trying to imply not the chocolate chip ones. If you say, 'I ate the cookies,' that means you could've eaten any kind. But if you specified which kind of cookies you ate, that probably means that you didn't eat the ones you didn't specify. But if you say, 'I ate some of the cookies,' they don't necessarily understand that means 'not all.'"
62,95,Lauren,"I always love these experiments because it shows that language learning continues so much longer than just being able to put a grammatical sentence together and that these words are actually hard to conceptualise on a scale. Part of why it is something that takes so long is because you just need lots and lots of examples of how 'some' means a particular thing in some contexts and something else in other contexts. In fact, some of the studies seem to let children improve their sense of what 'some' means by the end of the experiment because it's possibly the first time that children have received these nice, concrete examples of how much more or less 'some' is in a given context."
62,96,Gretchen,"There's an example from a study from Skordos and Papafragou which says if you do the 'I ate all the cookies -- what does this mean?', 'I ate the sugar cookies -- what does this mean?' example, and then you give the children an example with 'I ate some -- what does this mean?', if you present them in that order, they actually do better because you've given them these very concrete examples about 'What does this mean? What are the possible alternatives to what I could be implying here?' Whereas if you do them in the other order, they don't do as well with the 'some' before the 'all.'"
62,97,Lauren,"Such a fun constraint to have to think up in your study design. Like, we accidentally taught children more than they knew at the start of the experiment."
62,98,Gretchen,"They think it's because you can teach them this in an hour, which they'll gradually acquire through the course of their life, but if you give them this very focused practice for an hour, then suddenly they're performing much more like adults because now they've learned it."
62,99,Lauren,"The thing that all of the examples in this episode have in common is that the implicature comes up because we can put these things on a scale, but that's not the only way that implicature works."
62,100,Gretchen,"You can also imply things that don't really seem to be scalar. There was an example of a tweet that went up a little while ago where somebody posted a photo of a house that was for sale. There was a big sign on top of the 'For Sale' sign that said, 'Not Haunted.'"
62,101,Lauren,"Okay, so, I have a lot of questions that I possibly wouldn't have had if there was just a normal 'For Sale' sign."
62,102,Gretchen,"Right, exactly. The 'Not Haunted' sign is doing this implicature of 'Wait, but I am supposed to expect this house might be haunted?' But it's not doing so on a particular scale. Like, it's haunted or not haunted, which is not really a scale. It's just a 'Wait. Suddenly this information is relevant?'"
62,103,Lauren,This feels like an example of that meme of 'My 'House Not Haunted' sign has people asking a lot of questions that are already answered by my 'House Not Haunted' sign.'
62,104,Gretchen,"Sometimes bringing something up implies that it's relevant. We did an episode about the Gricean Maxims. This is talking about, okay, here's something that's relevant, which is also totally a type of implicature."
62,105,Lauren,"If you get to listen to the Gricean Maxims episode soon then scalar implicature is normally about a maxim of quantity because you're not giving a sufficiently clear indication of the relevant point on a scale, or you're playing with people's expectations about the quantity of information that you're giving, like suggesting that at least 10 ducks are in a photo of thousands of ducks."
62,106,Gretchen,Can I give you two more of my favourite examples of scalar implicature and how it can be used for humorous effect?
62,107,Lauren,"Yes, please."
62,108,Gretchen,"One of them is from somebody who's googled the number of squid species and has found at least five, which I am not a squid biologist, but this person informs me that they're off by two orders of magnitude."
62,109,Lauren,"Technically, not wrong. Not particularly right either."
62,110,Gretchen,The other example of scalar implicature which you don't have to know squid facts about is a tweet from the account @awhalefact which gives us the very helpful whale fact that many whales were never taught how to drive stick shift.
62,111,Lauren,"Uh. I mean, I guess I don't need to fact check this fact. I guess the joke here is coming from the fact that we're used to 'many' being something on a scale that's relevant, but no whales have learnt to drive stick shift, and so anything along this scale is absurd."
62,112,Gretchen,"'Many' implies 'not all' because if you knew that it was 'all,' you could've just said 'all.' We know that it's 'All whales have not been taught how to drive stick shift' because whales can't drive cars. But 'many' brings up in your mind, 'Wait. I thought none of them had. Does that mean there're some whales that have been taught how to drive stick shift?' In addition to the general non-scalar implicature that whales can even be taught how to drive at all and that you need to specify 'stick shift,' like, 'Many whales know how to drive an automatic.'"
62,113,Lauren,"Once you start noticing scales, you realise that they pop up all over the place whether that's absolute numerical scales or more relative semantic scales that you might not even have thought of as being put on a scale until you start thinking about the relationship between different words."
62,114,Gretchen,"Once you start noticing the scales, you can then start finding scalar implicature jokes everywhere you go. [Music]"

63,5,Gretchen,"I have some words, and I wanna know if you think these words are related."
63,6,Lauren,Okay.
63,7,Gretchen,"The first set of words is 'pasta,' 'paste,' 'pesto.' Are any of these words related? If so, which ones?"
63,8,Lauren,"I'm very observant, so I notice they all start with a P, and they have a similar shape to them. I like pasta and pesto in combination. I don't think that has anything to do with where these words come from."
63,9,Gretchen,"It's very valuable of you not to let your personal aesthetic judgements interfere with your search for etymological truth, yes."
63,10,Lauren,"'Paste' and 'pesto' feel like they should be related because they're both goopy things that you mash stuff up in. I'm gonna say 'paste' and 'pesto' are related. Then 'pasta' has me completely stumped in this one because I feel like I could make up some reason there's a relationship to do with how pasta is like a goopy dough that you cook, but I feel like I'm definitely just inventing connections between these words at this point. I'll say 'paste' and 'pesto' -- yes. 'Pasta' -- I'm not sure."
63,11,Gretchen,"Interestingly, you're wrong."
63,12,Lauren,"Oh, no! That's okay."
63,13,Gretchen,"Interestingly, 'pasta' and 'paste' are actually related. 'Pasta' comes via Italian after World War II because a lot of English speakers were in Italy at the time from Late Latin 'pasta' meaning 'dough, pastry cake' or 'paste,' from Greek 'pasta' meaning ''barley porridge,' probably originally 'a salted mess of food,'' from the neutral plural of 'pastos,' meaning 'sprinkled or salted,' from the Proto-Indo-European root '*kwet-,' 'to shake,' which is also a root for 'quash.' 'Paste' was originally 'dough for the making of bread or pastry,' also coming from Old French 'paste' meaning 'dough' or 'pastry,' which became Modern French 'pâte' and also related to 'pâté.'"
63,14,Lauren,"I was right to guess the smooshy relationship between those two, but that means that there's no relationship with 'pesto.'"
63,15,Gretchen,"There's no relationship with 'pesto.' The thing they have in common is this pureed nature. I was thinking, oh, man, this seems like 'pesto' should be part of this family as well because there's a bunch of stuff in there. But 'pesto' is also from Italian 'pesto,' contracted form of 'pestato,' from 'pestare,' ''to pound or to crush' in reference to the crushed herbs or garlic.' This is from the Latin root of 'pestle,' which you'll recall has a silent S in it."
63,16,Lauren,"It does, indeed."
63,17,Gretchen,"That was put in there because of this etymological relationship. Old French 'pestel,' Latin 'pistillum,' meaning a 'pounder' or a 'pestle,' related to 'pinsere,' 'to pound,' from Proto-Indo-European '*pis-to-' related to 'crush,' 'pounding,' 'winnowing' and things like that."
63,18,Lauren,"Interesting that it's had less of a shift as it's gone through history in its meaning, compared to 'pasta' which goes all the way back to something that meant 'sprinkle.'"
63,19,Gretchen,"Exactly. This 'crush' meaning -- I guess people have been crushing things for a long time in history and has had less of a shift when it goes along there. I mean, you can remember this because 'pasta' and 'paste' both have an A in the first vowel. But changing an A to an E is not necessarily a big deal in etymological situations. It could've been related. And looking it up and being like, 'Oh, 'pesto' is not related to 'pasta,' but it is related to 'pestle' with this silent T in there,' there're all these interesting connections."
63,20,Lauren,"I have another food-related one for you, Gretchen. This one is 'macaroon,' 'macaron,' and 'macaroni.' All of them the food things."
63,21,Gretchen,"The food things. So, 'macaroon,' at least for me, a macaroon is a thing with coconut in it that maybe some chocolate is gooped together with coconut. I dunno what other people have as 'macaroon.'"
63,22,Lauren,"Yeah, it's like a coconut-y, dough-y biscuit thing."
63,23,Gretchen,"And then a 'macaron' is the fancy one that has the two layers with the meringue sides. Then 'macaroni' is the pasta. Okay. I want 'macaroon' and 'macaron' is be related because they're both sweet dishes. There was also the Yankee Doodle stuck a feather in his hat and called it 'macaroni,' which is a thing because a 'macaroni' was a dandy."
63,24,Lauren,"Yeah, 'macaroni' was a fancy dish that fancy people ate, and so that's why he called it 'macaroni.'"
63,25,Gretchen,"So, 'macaroni' was the old-time-y equivalent of avocado toast or something?"
63,26,Lauren,"Yeah. [Laughter] It also might help you to know that 'macaroni,' before they became the little shells that we recognise, were more of a gnocchi-style dumpling."
63,27,Gretchen,Maybe all three of them are related. Maybe I'm gonna say all three of them are related. They're all little dumpling gloops of things.
63,28,Lauren,"Yep. They all come from an older Latin verb 'maccare,' 'to bruise,' so the process of bringing it all together and crushing it to create this food."
63,29,Gretchen,"Oh, is that like to 'macerate'?"
63,30,Lauren,I guess so. I don't actually know. I'm gonna look that up now.
63,31,Gretchen,"I feel like there's a lot of like, 'Oh, I wonder if that's related to this' when it comes to etymology. There's also the sort of pause-and-look-it-up step just to be sure."
63,32,Lauren,"According to Etymonline -- and I feel like that's a thing we're gonna say a lot this episode -- no, Latin is where we get 'maceration' from, and that is 'steeping or soaking something to make it soft or tender.'"
63,33,Gretchen,Which is not quite the same thing as 'crushing.'
63,34,Lauren,They sound similar but different histories.
63,35,Gretchen,"Different histories. Etymonline is great. Shout out to Etymonline. It's a free website where you can look up etymologies. They compile a bunch of different sources that are potentially locked behind pay walls -- but they're very legit sources, they're just harder to access -- and make them very convenient to find."
63,36,Lauren,"Also, those examples help make clear what it is that makes words related. Those etymologies are the histories of words and where they've come from if we trace them back through time. Some words trace back to the same point, like 'pasta' and 'paste,' and others trace back to other histories, like 'pestle' or 'macerate' and 'macaroni.'"
63,37,Gretchen,"I think it's really worth pointing out that just because two words resemble each other doesn't mean they have this common ancestry. Sometimes I meet somebody who's got the same hair as me, and I'm like, 'Oh my god, you have dark, curly hair just like me!' But that doesn't mean that they're my long-lost cousin, long-time removed. There are multiple avenues to arrive at dark, curly hair. There're multiple avenues to arrive at something like an M-A-C sequence at the beginning of a word. You can end up with these convergent points where it seems like words resemble each other. Sometimes, you can end up with histories that make a word look quite different in many steps along its way. As long as you can actually trace each of those steps, it's the history that makes the etymology. It's not just looking at two words in the present day and being like, 'These look like each other. I bet they're related.' Wondering if they're related is the fun bit where etymological investigation begins, but it needs to have that link to history because that's what makes it more than just free association."
63,38,Lauren,Like the words 'cook' and 'cookie.'
63,39,Gretchen,"Oh my god. 'Cook' and 'cookie.' I really, really feel like these should be related. But you told me they weren't. I went and looked it up in Etymonline, and then I didn't believe them either, and I looked it up in the Oxford English Dictionary, and they're not related."
63,40,Lauren,I really appreciate that you went and verified my anecdote from two sources before you would believe me on that. They're not related.
63,41,Gretchen,"'Cookie' comes from Dutch, from 'koekje,' which is a diminutive of 'cake.' It is actually related to Modern English 'cake.' I guess a 'cookie' is a little cake. They're not related to 'cook.' You don't cook a cookie. The Oxford English Dictionary actually has a note in it that's like, 'They're not related,' which they don't do very often. I think it's because it'd be so tempting to think that 'cook' and 'cookie' were."
63,42,Lauren,"I think the fact that you had to go look this up to believe me is a really great reminder that linguists don't actually know etymologies. It's something that we might hear them as stories, or we might research them. I am always pulling out my phone when people talk about etymologies or ask me etymology questions. I'm bringing up Etymonline, and I'm checking. Even if I think I know, sometimes I forget because you just wanna believe that these two words are related to each other."
63,43,Gretchen,"I mean, you say this, but also, of the linguists who know some etymologies, you wrote an etymology column for By Lingo for, like, five years, ten years."
63,44,Lauren,I wrote a story every two weeks about the history of an English word. It was a really great opportunity to use those sources like the Oxford English Dictionary and Etymonline to tell these stories like 'cook' and 'cookie' not being related. Another one is 'pest' and 'pester' come from completely different sources.
63,45,Gretchen,This is not related to the 'pesto' thing. This is 'pest' and 'pester.'
63,46,Lauren,"'Pest' and 'pester' are not related, and they're also not related to 'pesto.'"
63,47,Gretchen,"Ah, man. I buy the 'pesto' thing, but I really want 'pest' and 'pester' to be related. And yet, history says no."
63,48,Lauren,"You get these convergent mergings or parallels between words like 'cook' and 'cookie.' Even though we can trace back the histories of words, sometimes they're influencing each other as well."
63,49,Gretchen,"Like 'cookie' is not spelled the same way that it was in Dutch when it was being borrowed. In Dutch, it was spelled with a K, and they do different things with the vowels and so on. Possibly the way it was spelled in English may have been influenced by the word 'cook,' but that's a post hoc thing that doesn't actually relate to where the words came from originally."
63,50,Lauren,That's why you need that meticulous working back through history. It's also why for some words we just don't necessarily know where they come from because we can't follow them back in the written record or the relationship between languages to get back to whether it comes from a German language or whether it comes from Latin. There's these points in historical record where you can't trace them any further.
63,51,Gretchen,"It's really tempting to be like, oh, 'etymology unknown' and be like, 'I could know something.' But it's not 'knowing' at that point. It's speculating or making things up or something like that. Etymologists go to a lot of effort to look at sources and texts and records of stuff that was going on in other languages, stuff that was being borrowed in, records from travellers, records from immigrants, records from people who had contact with other languages and where words might've come from. Sometimes they do encounter, oh, here's this source that actually dates a word back ten years earlier than we thought we had, which was very exciting in Etymology-land. It's not the kind of thing that an average person or even a relatively well-trained linguist like you or I can just sit down and do for ourselves. We're reporting on stuff that other people have done for us."
63,52,Lauren,"I think especially for a language like English and a lot of the other major European languages, when it says 'unknown,' a lot of people have put a lot of time in to be able to say that. It's relatively conclusive. You can trace etymologies back for all of the world's languages because, if you think about it going forward, we're always thinking of new ways of using words, or extensions, or using them metaphorically that changes their use. For smaller languages, all of those stories might not have been put together yet. For a language like English that has such an extensive written record and has been so extensively researched, if they say the etymology is 'unknown' for a word like 'dog' -- 'dog' isn't in related languages. We don't know where it came from in English. I feel like I can trust the researchers on this because there has been so much research."
63,53,Gretchen,"If somebody had a compelling story for where 'dog' came from that was actually attested by the record, that would be, again, etymological news and would've been put somewhere. Whereas if a language has been less well-documented -- and I think that's something that is interesting about etymology is a lot of the early citations for etymologies were Shakespeare. That's not always just because Shakespeare came up with a bunch of these words. I mean, he probably came up with some, but it was also because when etymologists were working from, in the very early stages, whatever written text they had, the written text that everybody had was a complete work of Shakespeare and the King James Bible. It's like, well, we know it's at least as old as Shakespeare, but maybe there was a more obscure writer who was also using it in private correspondence a few decades or a few centuries earlier. Some of the early etymology work put words at least as old as Shakespeare because that's what people had access to in terms of records. It doesn't necessarily mean that Shakespeare coined every single word that he's cited to have coined."
63,54,Lauren,It's just a handy point in history that we have a record of.
63,55,Gretchen,"Early etymology research -- and still older etymology research -- is very paper-based, very text-based. You can't just, like, 'Oh, I'm just gonna do a little string search, and I can find this.' You're combing through pages, and you're reading things and trying to figure out what's there. If you happen to have some Shakespeare plays memorised or quasi-memorised or you're going to the theatre or something, it's easy to encounter Shakespeare as a source. Whereas these days, you can try to find the oldest tweet that said a word. Or you can try to find the oldest post on a social media site or the oldest -- Google has a time restricted website search feature where you can look for only websites that existed before 2004 or something like that. It's dicey. It's not always accurate, so you do need to verify it. When it works, it can be really interesting. You can trace back certain types of things that are internet related to say, okay, this word was used on LiveJournal in 2005 or something like that."
63,56,Lauren,"Which brings me to one of my favourite loaded phrases while you're talking about etymology and the history of words which is the phrase 'first recorded use,' which is very different to what could've potentially been the first use, especially of informal language which existed in private correspondence if it was written down at all. The written record gives us a good idea of the shape of the language but not its full range."
63,57,Gretchen,"A lot of people ask me if language is changing faster in the internet era. You get the sense that they really, really want that answer to be yes. They'll sometimes try to make my answer for that yes even if it's not what I'm saying. The thing is we just don't have complete enough records to know that for sure because a lot of the words that become trendy these days may become trendy for a week or so, but that doesn't mean that they stick around and stay in peoples' vocabularies. It's less clear how fast that is happening. Somebody would actually have to do that study. It's not a study that I'm aware of existing in terms of how fast does the average person's vocabulary change and how many of the words that are being added in a given year were coined within the last ten years or something like that. It'd be a very complicated study to actually do in practice. It's hard to say definitively English is changing faster or slower because what do you mean by that change and how long does that change have to persist for you to say it's a 'durable' change versus 'This is the trend of the week.'"
63,58,Lauren,It will hopefully keep future generations of people who make dictionaries very busy.
63,59,Gretchen,The good thing is we may be able to answer this question in another 100 years or something because we'll actually have so much more data of this period.
63,60,Lauren,"Human technology has always had a really interesting effect on language even before the internet. Even a technology like keeping track of dates has shifted the way that we talk about things like what we call the 'months' of the year. I feel that once you start thinking about etymology, and you start seeing it everywhere, sometimes you realise that influence and how it's occurred, thinking about things like the fact that 'December' doesn't fall in the tenth calendar month of our year, and you're like, 'There is definitely an interesting story there.'"
63,61,Gretchen,"That's a story of renaming which months of the year came first, starting the year with 'March' or switching around when things happen -- the whole September, October, November, December. Sometimes, people think about this, and they're like, this is really annoying because those etymologies are still relatively transparent to us. You do have other words that start with 'sept-' or 'dec-' that do have this correspondence to 'seven' or 'ten.' The fact that this particular set of ones don't has this frustration there. It's similar to people who get really stressed out about a word like 'decimate,' which these days means to 'kill' or 'devastate' in a numerically significant sort of way. People will be like, oh, well it's supposed to be 'kill one in ten.' It's like, yeah, but if that's how not how people are using it. There's lots of etymologies, probably most etymologies, that have some sort of twisting, wind-y path where some sort of meaning shifts somewhere, and this is just fine. This is just another one where this has happened. If 'December' isn't the tenth month then 'decimate' doesn't have to mean 'one in ten.'"
63,62,Lauren,I'm at peace with the fact that my cookies are not actually cakes and that my pasta is not still an actual paste.
63,63,Gretchen,"I mean, if you're gonna do the etymological fallacy, you can go off the rails really fast."
63,64,Lauren,"Once you realise that so many words in our everyday vocabulary come about through these innovations and moving forward in ways that are extending or being metaphors for what came before, you realise that the etymological history of something doesn't confine it to always being that way."
63,65,Gretchen,"There's something still so satisfying about learning a really good etymology where you're like, 'Oh, 'pasta' and 'paste,' I see it now.' Or like, 'Ah, I didn't think about 'macaroni' and 'macaroons.'' There are also a whole set of etymologies that make their way around that are actually fake -- that are just made-up connections between things and aren't real. I feel like this comes from somewhere."
63,66,Lauren,"I think it's just a need for good stories. A good etymology feels like it's a good story that's got a little bit of history, a little bit of an unexpected plot twist. I can see why a good etymology is so satisfying. I also feel like I'm always very wary of whether I trust an etymology. I often end up going back and checking it even if I have checked it before."
63,67,Gretchen,"I feel like occasionally etymologies give you this really great ah-ha! moment where you're like, 'Ah, these things are connected! I never realised it before.' The problem is, is that some etymologies are actually kind of boring instead. They're like, 'Okay, this is related to another word that meant a similar thing. It goes back to another older one that also meant a similar thing. Great.' Mm-hmm, fun. Or like, it meant something different, but not different in an interesting way, just sort of like, I dunno, different. If you're raised on a diet of etymology stories that are the hand-selected cream of the crop of the 10% that are super exciting, and you start encountering the normal, vegetable-y etymology stories that are not as exciting, you're like, 'This isn't very fun. I could do better.' You don't get that excitement, and you start speculating, you know, I was speculating like, 'What about 'macerate'?' If I hadn't gone and looked it up, I could've been like, 'Oh, yeah, I'll just repeat this to someone and not think about actually verifying what's going on.'"
63,68,Lauren,"Before we had tools like Etymonline, you would have to go to a specialist dictionary that had etymologies in it. It would take an amount of effort. You'd have to have one of those on your shelf. Now, we have this reliable information for free on the internet. My philosophy now is, if you tell the person the etymology of 'fish,' they'll have good facts for a day. If you teach them to look up the etymology of the word 'fish,' they'll have facts for a lifetime."
63,69,Gretchen,"I often get people who find out I'm a linguist at a party, and they're like, 'Oh, great.' And then they start messaging me their etymology questions. Maybe they get one question for free, and then after that I'm like, look, have you heard of the wonders of these websites. There's Etymonline, which is really great. It's etymonline.com. The Oxford English Dictionary, if you look up the free Oxford English Dictionary, it has a very truncated etymology and a very truncated definition with a few examples. If you go for the big one -- the full OED -- you need a paid subscription, but a lot of libraries -- like public libraries, they don't have to be an academic library -- a lot of public libraries will pay for an access to that. I look up things on the OED all the time because my Montreal library card -- which is even a French library system -- still has paid for OED access because it's such a basic resource. A lot of public libraries have paid for this. You can log in on their website with your library card. It works for a lot of places."
63,70,Lauren,They're the two sources I use a lot as well. I feel like I've gone through a bit of a shift in my philosophy over the years. I used to find it entertaining to be able to share these facts with people and make it seem like I did have all this knowledge. I think it's actually more fun these days to show people that all you're doing is actually pulling out your phone or pulling up a browser tab and researching it in real time with them.
63,71,Gretchen,"Sometimes you can discover new things while you're doing that because you're like, oh, actually there's also this relationship. I've definitely been that person on my phone in the pub pulling up Etymonline being like, ''Fish' -- I bet that's related to 'Pisces' because that's probably the same P-to-F sound change that's in 'pater -- father,' 'foot -- ped.'' Sure enough, Old English 'fish,' Proto-Germanic 'fiskaz,' perhaps from Proto-Indo-European root '*pisk-,' 'a fish.'"
63,72,Lauren,Cute.
63,73,Gretchen,"For 'Pisces' you have Latin 'pisces,' plural of 'piscis,' 'fish,' from Proto-Indo-European root '*pisk-,' 'a fish.' There you are again."
63,74,Lauren,"Fabulous. Your guesswork raises a really good point which is that, while I'm always wary of an un-cited etymology story, I love trying to guess the etymology before looking it up and having my guess confirmed or not. I think one thing that thinking like a linguist helps with with these etymologies is you know the common paths that etymologies take, and you know these regular sound changes that if something had a /f/ sound in a Germanic language, it's likely to have a /p/ sound in Latin. These help you make better educated guesses about the likely relationship between words, although you can stumble on the 'cookie' trap."
63,75,Gretchen,"When I was learning Dutch for a little while -- because I studied German back before I knew any linguistics, and so I was just learning vocabulary items. Then I was studying Dutch for a while, and I was like, oh, this is so great because every time I learn a new word, I go look up the etymology, and I try to find a connection to German, or I try to find a connection to English, or I'm like, oh, here's this Germanic sound shift that happened. You can track that back, and you can learn things about etymological pathways which gives you the ability to predict things. Etymologists are still such a source to go look for, okay, there's stuff there that other people have done way more research than I have."
63,76,Lauren,"In fact, it is a very specific profession. The people who research etymologies are etymologists -- not to be confused with entomologists."
63,77,Gretchen,"As the classic joke goes. There's this great anecdote in the book Word By Word by Kory Stamper who was a lexicographer at Merriam-Webster for a long time. She has these stories about writing definitions at Merriam-Webster and all these sorts of things. Then she has a section where she talks about specifically the etymologist, Jim, who worked at Merriam-Webster, and like, this is his thing, and this is what his cubicle looked like, and he had all these papers, and all these dictionaries, and he spoke a ton of languages. I mean, he may still speak them. I don't know if this is past or present. The quote that I remember from it is, 'If logophiles,' like word-nerds, 'want to be lexicographers when they grow up then lexicographers want to be etymologists.'"
63,78,Lauren,We always talk about lexicography being an incredibly specialist and niche job to do. Then etymology is even more narrow and specific in expertise.
63,79,Gretchen,"It's a niche within a niche of further specialisation. There's this sense that a satisfying etymology is a dangerous etymology because sometimes these two words sound similar, maybe they're related. Maybe that's true. But it's really something that you wanna put a big Wikipedia 'Citation Needed' stamp on."
63,80,Lauren,"That's a good way to think about it. Any time you hear an etymology, and someone doesn't tell you that it specifically came from a source, you should think about getting a citation for it."
63,81,Gretchen,"I wanna say specifically if you see an etymology from an image file, you should not trust it. If that etymology looks like a meme, you should give it the exact amount of credence that you give any other meme, which is 'Oh, that's fun. Uh...'"
63,82,Lauren,That's a good diagnostic.
63,83,Gretchen,"If the etymology's in an image file, you need to look it up on the equivalent of snopes.com for etymologies. We have it -- it's Etymonline. You can do that."
63,84,Lauren,"I wonder if sometimes it's easy to forget that etymologies are these meticulously researched things because we don't normally attribute etymology work to an individual. We just take a dictionary as a generic source rather than the work of many, many individual people."
63,85,Gretchen,"I think that's something weird about the construction of dictionaries and etymologies together as reference sources because as linguists we're also saying, 'Oh, no, you can question the dictionary.' The definitions in the dictionary are just what some humans have noticed that some humans are using this word for. There can absolutely be definitions for words or even words entire that haven't been recorded in the dictionary yet. That part is legitimate. Yet, people place a lot of faith on the existence of a word in a dictionary and the definition of a word in the dictionary and not enough faith on the etymology of the word in the dictionary. It's like, here are two things you don't have to trust as much because a word can be a perfectly legitimate word if it's not in a dictionary. And yet, here is the historical bit that's actually someone has looked through a dictionary of Old Frisian so that you don't have to and figured out whether there's a connection there. That bit is the bit you do wanna outsource the research to someone else for."
63,86,Lauren,Etymology is one of those times that I really do trust the experts who have done their research. It's also really exciting that resources like Etymonline democratise access to that resource and that anyone can fact check an etymology story.
63,87,Gretchen,I also feel like we'd be remiss not to mention the most debunk-y of the false etymologies because we're trying to not repeat false etymologies because part of not propagating the myths is not continuing them. I think the big one that comes up a lot is most things are not acronyms.
63,88,Lauren,This is a big one that saves you a lot of time in terms of trusting an etymology.
63,89,Gretchen,"Something that I think is really interesting about acronyms in English in general is the word 'acronym' only entered the English language in the 1940s. If a word has existed in English before the 1940s, it's not an acronym."
63,90,Lauren,"Jesse Sheidlower has an even easier way of doing this which is just, if someone says it's an acronym, they're wrong because no one ever tells you that the really boring words that are definitely from acronyms are acronyms. That makes it even easier to remember."
63,91,Gretchen,"I mean, to some extent, that's a little bit simplistic. Words like 'radar' and 'scuba' are real acronyms. 'NASA' is an acronym. Organisations are often acronyms. 'Lol' is an acronym."
63,92,Lauren,But no one spends a lot of time telling you that or coming up with very elaborate stories for their origin.
63,93,Gretchen,"You get these very elaborate stories. I think 'posh' is one of the famous ones. There's a famous one about the F-word. These are really not acronyms. They have very outlandish phrasing of things. The acronyms that are old as acronyms often still really feel acronym-y. They really feel like they're individual letters. The Romans had this acronym 'SPQR,' which stood for 'Senatus Populusque Romanus' which is 'The Senate and People of Rome. But 'SPQR' has no vowels in it. You have to read that as an acronym. Or something like 'e.g.,' or 'i.e.,' which we still read as the individual letters, you have to read that as an acronym. There's a distinction that some people make between an acronym and an initialism, but I think that it's unnecessary and that talking about acronyms is sufficiently clear for most people. In either case, most of the words that enter Modern English do not originate as taking the first letters of a bunch of other words. That's how you get names of, I wanna say, research groups make themselves into acronyms. Names of products, maybe your funding organisations, or groups of people like to make etymological acronyms, but common words are really not acronym based. The other thing about acronyms is I grew up during the era of internet acronym over-hype."
63,94,Lauren,It was a fun time.
63,95,Gretchen,"It was a fun time. It was the forerunner of this emoji hype cycle which is like, 'Oh, no! The kids, they're not gonna speak English anymore. They're only gonna use emoji.' Um, back in my day, kids, it was, 'Oh, no! The kids, they're not gonna use English anymore. They're only gonna communicate in acronyms.' You'd get these really ridiculous, sensationalist media articles that would be like, 'We've converted Shakespeare plays into acronyms because that's what the kids like, right?' They were so bad. At the time, I thought maybe I'm just not very cool, and there are kids somewhere who are doing this level of acronym-ing. In retrospect, having benefitted from media scholarship and other research and things like that, the answer is, it's not that I was cool, but the cool kids also were not doing this. I coined -- here's a thing that you should be suspicious about if you encounter it in media somewhere, which is what I like to call 'EIAFUP.'"
63,96,Lauren,What does 'EIAFUP' stand for?
63,97,Gretchen,It stands for 'Elaborate Invented Acronyms For Uncommon Phrases.'
63,98,Lauren,"I am not gonna commit that one to memory, sorry."
63,99,Gretchen,"I really wouldn't bother. Acronyms are fun to make. If you can get a really clever acronym to name your club with, I'm not saying don't do it. But yeah, if someone says it's an acronym, it's probably not."
63,100,Lauren,"We have some good diagnostic criteria to get your etymological senses tingling. Don't trust an acronym story. Don't trust a meme-formatted etymology. In fact, always just be willing to fact check yourself using any of the resources that are available online very easily for a language like English."
63,101,Gretchen,I think it's really liberating to realise that both etymology can be looked up and that etymology also isn't destiny. Just because a word has 'decem-' in it doesn't mean that it has to be related to the number ten. We're not constrained to doing things the same way we always have.
63,102,Lauren,The other thing I really like about etymology is when you take the chance to look forward as well as thinking about going backward and that we are laying the foundations today for new etymologies and new stories as words continue to be used and evolved and applied to new things and new ideas. Etymology isn't a single endpoint or a destination. It's a journey that we're all on together. [Music]

64,1,Gretchen,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics! I'm Gretchen McCulloch."
64,2,Lauren,"I'm Lauren Gawne. Today, we're getting enthusiastic about ways of seeing sound waves. But first, LingComm grants are running again in 2022. These are small grants designed to help people start new projects to communicate linguistics to broader audiences."
64,3,Gretchen,"This year we have one $500.00 grant and ten $100.00 start-up grants. We'll add additional grants if we end up with more patrons by the time the grant applications close. We started the LingComm grants because a small amount of seed money would've made a huge difference to us when we were starting out, and we wanted to help there be more interesting linguistics communication in the world."
64,4,Lauren,Information is on the LingComm website. That's 'comm' with two Ms. We'll put the link on our shownotes. The grants close at the end of March 2022.

64,6,Gretchen,"Learning about sounds in an intro linguistics class is kind of weird because we're already generally really good at processing sounds. We're doing it right now. One of the things that you end up having to figure out how to do is how to unlearn some of that automatic processing that you've been doing since you were a tiny kid and re-learn how to process it in a more awkward way so that you can actually look at what's going on there and not this very sophisticated object that your brain has made it into, which is language."
64,7,Lauren,"Framing it as a process of un-learning is a really nice way of putting it. I know some profs teach phonetics using sign language phonetics and hand shapes first because, for non-signers, there's less for them to un-learn. But when it comes to learning speech sounds, if you've grown up with a spoken language, it really is hard to actually pay attention to what you're so used to attending to."
64,8,Gretchen,"It's often hard to believe. Like, what do you mean these two things that I think of as the same T sound are actually different T sounds? They seem the same to me. I'm used to thinking of them as the same. It's necessary for my understanding of this language that I'm very fluent in that I treat them the same way but trying to figure out and unpack what's actually different about them is this long process that you encounter in introduction to linguistics."
64,9,Lauren,"Part of that process is realising that studying speech is actually studying a lot of different processes. You're studying the way that you move your mouth or your hands around to articulate things, and you also have to study how you make sense of the signals coming into your brain and turn them into something that you understand."
64,10,Gretchen,"There's also a spot where you can trap some things in the middle and say, okay, before we get to what's going on in the brain when you're receiving speech sounds or when you're receiving the visuals of signs, what's going on if you try to look at things with a -- I don't know if a microphone is an objective look at what sounds are -- but at least a sort of interceptive look at what sounds are doing."
64,11,Lauren,"You're trying to capture something physical that's travelling through the air. For spoken languages, that's sound waves."
64,12,Gretchen,"The cool thing about analysing sound waves is that if you're analysing it as, okay, here's a recording or here's something we've got, you can then start trying to figure out what are other ways of representing this information rather than just playing back the same sound to me over and over again, which is one way of doing a bit of analysis. It lets you get this very precise repetition of exactly the same thing. But also, what if you created visual versions of what the sound is because our eyes are better at analysing things in multiple dimensions -- two or even three dimensions -- whereas our ears are analysing things in one linear dimension of time."
64,13,Lauren,"Audio recordings were a massive step forward, I have to say, when it comes to analysing what's happening with spoken language, but as you said, it's being able to engage with that information in a different way by looking at it with your eyes rather than just playing it back with your ears really does allow us to open up and look at what is happening in that speech sound."
64,14,Gretchen,"There's lots of different kinds of visualisations you can make of sounds. I think one of the ones that is probably pretty familiar at this point to people is the idea of seeing a wave form of sounds when it comes out. I remember the first time I saw a wave form it was something like one of those programs like Winamp that they had on early computers, whereas, like, wow, wait, the line gets taller when sound is louder, and it gets shorter when it's quiet? This is now so common. Basically, every podcast app -- a lot of them have ways of visualising the sound, or their logo has a way of visualising that, it's on SoundCloud, like, everyone's just doing this all the time. This was really revelatory in, like, the '90s."
64,15,Lauren,"We make use of that wave form when we're editing the podcast. So, because something that's really loud and sharp has a really spiky signature on the wave file, we use claps to indicate where Claire, our editor, should maybe pay attention to, or if we wanna mark that we're moving between parts of it. Thankfully, we do edit it out, so we don't have to listen to the claps outside of the editing. When you work with sound files as these wave forms for a while, you get very good at spotting those kind of patterns in the visual information."
64,16,Gretchen,"Yeah, you can spot, okay, this looks like it's gonna be a person talking, and this is clearly something that's not talking -- it's a sharp sound like a clap or it's some sort of buzz of my refrigerator running or something like that."
64,17,Lauren,"One thing you can't see though is spaces between words. When it comes to a wave form, you might think the gaps in the wave form are gaps that happen between words, but we don't actually have silence between words. Speech is just this long string. We hallucinate the gaps between words pretty much."
64,18,Gretchen,"I feel like I am now extremely self-conscious of every word that's coming out of my mouth and whether I'm putting a space between them, but I'm really not. This is partly apparent when, you know, you run words together, or you're saying something, like, babies will talk about 'allgone' as if it's all one word, which it sort of could be, the way it's treated. Or you're saying like, 'Oh, is this compound -- should I be writing it with a space or without a space?' Well, it's because the spaces are not actually pronounced. The spaces are fake. They're a social construct that gets added later. Not all languages do it. Some orthographies don't have spaces between words."
64,19,Lauren,You might be more acutely aware of this if you've recently tried to listen to speech in a language you are not at all familiar with. You suddenly realise just how much your brain is doing to segment out words when suddenly you can't figure out the segments between words.
64,20,Gretchen,"Absolutely. I think there's sort of an irony that doing this analysis of sounds and wave forms is called 'acoustic phonetics' because when I think of acoustics, I think of maybe an acoustic guitar, or like you go into a theatre, and you're like, 'Wow, this space has really good acoustics!' That's about how good the sound is when you're not electronically amplifying it, whereas this kind of acoustics is specifically generally about using some sort of technology to analyse what's going on with the sound. 'Acoustic' just means 'sound.' It depends on which direction you're approaching acoustics from."
64,21,Lauren,"Acoustic phonetics is analysing the properties of the sound waves of speech and not necessarily the bits of your mouth and speech stream that you're using to make those sounds happen or the way that your brain is processing those sounds. Although, obviously, all three of these are important for a well-rounded understanding of how sound in language works."
64,22,Gretchen,"I think that's, as they say, a topic for another episode. Let's stay on sound waves. The wave part is interesting. It can tell you loudness. But there's also other things in the speech stream that make two sounds different from each other that aren't just how loud they are."
64,23,Lauren,"Absolutely. I could say /i/ and /a/, and I could say them with the same amount of loudness. They would look more or less the same in a wave form. But if we use another form of visualisation, we can begin to see the difference between those two sounds."
64,24,Gretchen,Lots of different sounds. The tool that linguists generally use for this more elaborate thing which looks specifically at pitch and all of the different kinds of pitches that are going on in a particular sound is known as a 'spectrogram.'
64,25,Lauren,Spectrograms look very science. Acoustic phonetics is very science. I often talk about phonetics being essentially a form of physics because you're studying the physical properties of sound waves. It's spectrograms where you really get this sense of the role of physics in phonetics.
64,26,Gretchen,They look like the most science.
64,27,Lauren,"There is a lot happening in a spectrogram. That's because there's a lot happening with the voice. A lot of really simple sounds -- like a single tone note, especially an electronically generated one, is a really simple sound. There's not a lot happening in it. You can see the repetition in the wave really easily. That is not the case for human speech. There is so much happening."
64,28,Gretchen,"Well, and you think about this, and it makes sense, right, because you can tell the difference between me saying /i/ and you saying /i/ or someone else saying /i/. You can recognise people by their voices. Every human has got a certain level of differentiation. You can also sometimes tell other things about someone by their voice. You can tell sometimes someone's accent. You can tell sometimes things about how deep their voice is -- their body shape and size and age and sometimes where they're from. There's all these things that go into, okay, well, you're saying /i/ and I'm saying /i/ and yet how do you recognise someone on the phone."
64,29,Lauren,A spectrogram is going along in time. We read them from left to right as the time goes along. Down the bottom are the lower frequency sounds and at the top are the higher frequency sounds.
64,30,Gretchen,One thing that made the spectrogram make sense to me was thinking of it as a really large and elaborate and zoomed out musical scale.
64,31,Lauren,A musical scale with a lot of notes.
64,32,Gretchen,"You know how normally you have a musical staff, and it's got five lines, and then they've got a few notes on it that make a chord. This is like, okay, imagine if you have a thousand lines. And, actually, maybe instead of writing the lines at all because at the scale of a thousand lines you can't really see anything anymore, you're only gonna write the dots that are the notes."
64,33,Lauren,A thousand lines and a thousand fingers is a very long piano.
64,34,Gretchen,"I don't think this is necessarily a very practical piano, but I do think that it's sort of what a spectrogram is where if you have little, teeny-tiny, short chords that are made up of 50 things that are distributed along this staff somewhere, and then you can hear what the difference is in between them."
64,35,Lauren,"That's one way of thinking about it. One thing I like about that is that, like music, you can begin to sight read a spectrogram -- certainly not with the same ease as having only a standard scale, but you can begin to see what's going on with speech and start to read a spectrogram."
64,36,Gretchen,"I also think music notes are a lot more abstracted because you can play the same notes on a piano or a violin or something, but they would look very different on a spectrogram. You could put in the notes on a piano or the notes on a violin of someone playing a song into a spectrogram as well, just like you can a human voice, and you could see much more specific versions of what they're doing because that's also how you can tell a violin from a piano from a trumpet or something like that."
64,37,Lauren,Do you remember when you started being trained to look at spectrograms?
64,38,Gretchen,"I feel like my first impression of them was that they were very blurry -- like a lot of very blurry dots and smudges. It was trying to look at some text maybe from very far away, like without my glasses on, where I could just see the impressions of the darker grey smudges in some areas where there was more stuff going on and the lighter smudges in other areas where there wasn't a lot going on."
64,39,Lauren,"So, studying phonetics was a little bit like getting your spectrogram glasses."
64,40,Gretchen,"Yeah. Although, much slower. I didn't get to just put the glasses on and now I understand everything."
64,41,Lauren,"That's absolutely true even for people who are trained to read spectrograms. Phoneticians actually have spectrogram-reading competitions when you put a group of phoneticians together because it is challenging even for professionals because there's some information that is easy to extract from a spectrogram and some that is less easy to extract, or you have to infer or intuit or calculate."
64,42,Gretchen,"I'm just picturing the phoneticians at the pub trivia night but for spectrograms. You pass around a bunch of spectrograms on some paper, and you're like, 'Okay, figure out what this says,' and like, prizes."
64,43,Lauren,"And even if you're great at reading them, they can still prove challenging. I remember talking to some amazing phoneticians, and they were talking about the time they had a spectrogram that had a sentence that included the word 'sunglasses.' They could not figure out this word in the spectrogram because it turns out the person saying it -- and a lot of people -- when they say the word 'sunglasses,' that /gl/ in the middle becomes a bit like /klɑsəz/. It's a bit breathy-er. That changes how it looks in the spectrogram."
64,44,Gretchen,"And so, they were like, 'We can't figure out what this sound is because it doesn't look like /gl/.'"
64,45,Lauren,"Yeah. They were like, 'What is happening?'"
64,46,Gretchen,"I feel like this is one of the things that's different compared to writing sounds in the International Phonetic Alphabet which is a thing that's based on how you're articulating the sounds. If you see a word that's written in the International Phonetic Alphabet, you can be like, okay, I can put my tongue and my lips and my other articulators in the right configuration, and I can output this sound. You wouldn't have a competition of like, 'Oh, let's see who can read the IPA,' because it would just be -- like, by the time you're a professional phonetician, you would all be scoring 100%."
64,47,Lauren,"But because each spectrogram is a unique representation of a unique individual saying a unique thing, there's all kinds of things happening in speech like that that you can begin to unpack with a spectrogram but is still really surprising even to people who've been reading them and dealing with phonetics for a long time."
64,48,Gretchen,"It's still enough of a challenge that you can make it into a pub trivia night, which is kind of fun. I think my first spectrograms were in a textbook -- in academic papers. I have this preference to see them in black and white with a greyscale even though there're all these programs now that can add colour to your spectrogram. I'm like, 'Ooo, I dunno. I feel like this is harder to read.' I was trained on the greyscale ones."
64,49,Lauren,"I was trained on greyscale ones, too. I know a lot of phoneticians have a preference for those. I remember we did our early spectrogram analysis on paper. They were printed out ones."
64,50,Gretchen,"Oh, whoa!"
64,51,Lauren,"Some of them were really old and had been photocopied multiple times, which simplified it a little bit. I remember physically marking out the different sounds that we could see. A lot of people now are trained to read them directly from the computer output that creates them, but there's definitely different preferences for different groups of researchers."
64,52,Gretchen,"I was looking back at my old phonetics textbook just when we were preparing this episode to see what we were trained on, and they had a bunch of spectrograms in the exercises section that had European capital cities. They said, 'Okay, your job is to figure out which of the European capital cities these seven spectrograms are.' You know, 'Is this Helsinki? Is this Stockholm? Is this Paris?'"
64,53,Lauren,"Oh, I like that because it adds a bit of constraint, which a plain spectrogram doesn't."
64,54,Gretchen,"Exactly. You can start being like, all right, well, Paris, let's see if one of these looks like it might begin with a P. It really narrows the space down enough which makes it easy enough for students to do."
64,55,Lauren,"If you do find yourself reading spectrograms, there are a couple of really first steps things you can pay attention to to start decoding what's happening."
64,56,Gretchen,Please get out your notepad in case you ever want to participate in a spectrogram reading competition at the pub near you.
64,57,Lauren,I wish there were more of those. That would be great.
64,58,Gretchen,What should you know?
64,59,Lauren,"The first thing, as with the wave files, is that any gaps that you see are not the spaces between words because we've already established speech doesn't have neat spaces between words. It's just a continual string. Those gaps are actually what happens when you say a sound like /t/ or /p/ where there's some kind of stop. This is why these sounds are called 'stops' sometimes or 'plosives.'"
64,60,Gretchen,"Because you stop the air from coming out of your mouth, and so you're making a stop -- /p/ /t/ /b/ /d/ /k/. These are all gonna have little silence gaps that look like nothing except it's that nothing and then releasing it into the vowel that makes the consonant appear."
64,61,Lauren,"Then at the other end of things, those sounds like /s/ and /f/ and /ʃ/, these sounds that are long, tend to look a little bit like static. They're very fuzzy on a spectrogram."
64,62,Gretchen,"They look like noise. They're scattered around. You can tell the difference between them because of where this band of noise is. But if you just say something like /fff/ or /sss/, it might sound like, oh, the audio file is just glitching. All I'm hearing is static waves from a radio. I feel like a lot of metaphors that are used to introduce spectrograms are really from a slightly earlier genre of audio recording -- but anyway."
64,63,Lauren,"They are very analogue even though we make them digitally now. It's this noisy -- they're called 'fricatives,' and they have this fricating buzzy-ness to them that you can see on a spectrogram."
64,64,Gretchen,This is the same type of thing that you would see if you have a microphone out in the wind. You have this sort of [imitates wind blowing] wind rushing across the microphone. It's gonna create that same sort of noise.
64,65,Lauren,Then vowels are a whole other party. They tend to be the most visually prominent thing in a spectrogram.
64,66,Gretchen,"Yeah. If you're like, 'Oh, whoa, there's some stuff going on here,' you're like, 'Ah, that's probably vowels,' because they look like they're doing something fancy."
64,67,Lauren,They have these little bands of sound. It's those bands that begin to tell you the difference between a vowel like /a/ and a vowel like /i/.
64,68,Gretchen,"The way vowels look on a spectrogram is something that's very easy to analyse because there's lots of stuff going on there. I think it's interesting because vowels are the more musical part of the speech stream. It's really hard to just sing a /p/ /p/. You can beatbox a /p/ /p/, but it's not really sing-y, whereas you can sing a bunch of stuff like /aaa/ /laaa/. That's got a lot of this musical continuity of the notes going up and down. That's what makes it both hard to characterise in terms of what's actually going on precisely inside your mouth because there's a lot of fluidity between vowels but also easy to look at what's going on if you're looking at the acoustic signal because they're so bright and loud and have all of this stuff going on there."
64,69,Lauren,It would be remiss of us to talk about spectrograms without talking about the way they're generated.
64,70,Gretchen,"When I think about spectrograms, I think about one programme, and it's called 'Praat.'"
64,71,Lauren,Yeah.
64,72,Gretchen,"I feel like this is the classic programme that I used when I was an undergrad. It's still being used. I was walking a friend through it the other day, and I was like, yep, all the buttons are exactly where they were 10 years ago. It's this programme that's been around since, I think, 1991. It comes from the Dutch word for 'talk.' Linguists have just been using it. This is the thing that I would expect any linguist to be using if you're talking about spectrograms."
64,73,Lauren,"I was trained to use Praat. I'm very fond of it. Just like you, I can still open it now. It's only had a handful of updates in the last decade or so. I can still navigate it as well. It really is a foundational piece of software that a lot of linguists who do any phonetics will encounter."
64,74,Gretchen,"It's specifically well generated for doing exactly the kinds of things that linguists want to do with a sound-analysing programme. You know, the default settings are all set up for the human voice. The default ways that the spectrogram is displayed -- so if you have higher or lower pitches, those sounds would be literally physically higher or lower on the diagram. The default pitches are set up to be ones that work for the human voice. And the default settings are set up to be like, okay, here's this black and white image that's gonna go really well in your paper. You're gonna be able to print it off. You're not gonna have to pay for coloured ink. Here's this thing that is set up to integrate really well into, I think, a linguist workflow."
64,75,Lauren,"It's very easy to take for granted, but the fact that you can just record something and then try again, or record lots of versions of it, is very easy to do in Praat. Before Praat, the old spectrogram machines were really big and noisy, and you had one shot to say the thing that you wanted to see on a spectrogram. It was a lot more high stakes and, apparently, also really smelly to print."
64,76,Gretchen,Oh. Did you actually use those machines?
64,77,Lauren,I have not used one. There was one sitting in the back of someone's office at the University of Melbourne when I was there. It is just large and beautiful and makes me even more grateful for Praat because to use one of them is very high stakes.
64,78,Gretchen,"I don't think it ever occurred to me, like, what were people using before Praat because it's always been there. It's a free programme. I think it's open-source, or at least anybody can download it for free if you wanna download and try it out. It's just the classic programme that people are using."
64,79,Lauren,"Old spectrogram machines were called 'Sona-Graphs.' They were called 'sonagrams.' They are distantly related to today's sonagraphs that you get as an ultrasound. Those pictures that people have of their, like, 'We're having a baby,' little grey, fuzzy things. It's not a dissimilar aesthetic if you think about it."
64,80,Gretchen,Huh. I guess that's true. I was looking into the history of spectrograms and came across a blog post which we'll link to about using spectrograms to analyse birdsongs.
64,81,Lauren,"I have never actually thought about them for anything other than human speech. But of course, they would be useful for a whole bunch of things, wouldn't they?"
64,82,Gretchen,"Exactly. There's this history of using spectrograms for birdsongs because you can grow to identify exactly what the acoustic signature of a particular birdsong is. Because, you know, the big advantage that analysing human sounds has is that every human comes equipped with a human vocal tract. So, if you describe to somebody how to make a sound, even if they don't have that in their native language, they can maybe configure their tongue and their lips and so on in the right way to make it. But we don't have the vocal tracts of birds."
64,83,Lauren,This is true.
64,84,Gretchen,"Yeah, I think a non-controversial statement here. If you're trying to tell people, okay, this is what this birdsong sounds like, you've got all these ways of approximating, okay, you know, maybe this is more of a 'cheep,' maybe this is more of a 'peep,' maybe this is more of a 'coo.' You have these onomatopoeic words. You have these ways of representing the rhythm of the sound. So, if you wanna say cuckoo makes a 'cuckoo cuckoo,' or a rooster makes a 'cock-a-doodle-doo,' and that tells you some things about the rhythm and the pitch change. You also have, okay, maybe we can present these in a visual form which is here's what, visually, this particular birdcall looks like."
64,85,Lauren,"I guess there isn't an IPT -- and International Phonetic Tweet-abet -- that you can use, so spectrograms give you a nice quantifiable visual of those songs."
64,86,Gretchen,"I actually went and looked, and I already had on my phone this app called 'BirdNET,' which tries to help you identify birds based on their calls. It takes audio input you record on your phone, and then it tries to tell you what the bird is. It's actually recording a spectrogram. I just hadn't noticed that it was a spectrogram because it's using different colours than I was used to."
64,87,Lauren,"You really are trained to read those black and white graphs, aren't you?"
64,88,Gretchen,"Yeah, I really am. It's using a slightly different sampling frequency, I think, so the lines have different thicknesses than I'm used to. I went back and looked at it, and it is just 100% a spectrogram in a slightly different visual schema."
64,89,Lauren,They're not using Praat. I wonder what the bird version of Praat would be.
64,90,Gretchen,"I mean, if 'praat' is the Dutch word for 'talk,' I went and looked up the Dutch word for the sound a bird makes, and I think it would be 'piep' -- peep!"
64,91,Lauren,"That is so wholesome and satisfying. Now that we've talked a little bit about what spectrograms are, shall we have a look at one?"
64,92,Gretchen,"Yeah. Something that was not as much the case for spectrograms when I was in school is there are now live spectrogram websites where you can just talk into the website, and you get this live spectrogram of exactly what you're saying. That's really cool."
64,93,Lauren,It is a lot of fun. We have the link to the one that we're using in the shownotes. There's also another one that we'll link to that has some demo files if you don't have a microphone or you don't wanna be the one talking into it. It's also got some bird sounds and other animal sounds so you can really begin to see just how distinct and recognisable human speech is compared to the acoustic information from other types of sounds.
64,94,Gretchen,The fun thing with this is -- so we're gonna talk into the spectrogram and look at what we're saying. Then you can either follow along with the audio bit of that or go to our YouTube channel and see the literal spectrogram words of what we've just said to get a sense of following along with us.
64,95,Lauren,"You can also follow the link and do the sounds yourself. If you try and play us into the thing, it won't look the same because this is an MP3 file as a podcast. It's compressed, which changes the way the acoustic information comes through even though we perceive it exactly the same."
64,96,Gretchen,This is part of the magic of what your brain is doing.
64,97,Lauren,"If you are just listening, this is gonna be a short segment where you get to join in the long tradition of just listening to or participating at making strings of sounds while doing phonetics. We hope that you are in public."
64,98,Gretchen,[Laughs] For maximum embarrassment potential.
64,99,Lauren,"Okay. I am going to start the spectrogram timeline. The moment that I do that, you can see it absolutely light up. This is a colour one. I'm sorry, Gretchen. This isn't a black and white one."
64,100,Gretchen,I know I'm gonna have to get used to it.
64,101,Lauren,"I'm sure you'll cope. It is a lot of fun. Those brighter red bits mean that something is louder or there's more acoustic intensity there. You can see already that there are gaps, and they are not the gaps between words."
64,102,Gretchen,"There are potentially gaps between speakers, which are probably really easy to see. When I see this going live, compared to Praat, which is so, like, you record a sound, and then you get the spectrogram of that sound, I just see this moving so fast."
64,103,Lauren,Indeed.
64,104,Gretchen,"But I guess this is how fast we're talking. It's moving at the rate of one second per second, so there we are. It's tricky right now because the sound is doing a whole bunch of stuff because we're producing full sentences. Let's do some tests with simpler sounds."
64,105,Lauren,Let's start with fricatives because they have that really distinct noisy pattern that is a bit like static on television. Let's try and make some basic fricative sounds.
64,106,Gretchen,Okay.
64,107,Lauren,/sssss/ /sss/ /fffff/ /ʃʃʃʃʃ/. I hope you didn't tune in then. It would've sounded like we've gone off air.
64,108,Gretchen,"Yeah. I think the fun thing is, is you can see the /s/ /s/ is really higher pitched and the /ʃ/ is a little bit lower but also a little bit louder, which is maybe why the shh-ing sound lets you get someone's attention to shush them. The /f/ is really quieter and more disbursed -- /f/ /s/ /f/ /s/ /f/ /s/ /f/ /s/ /fs/ /fs/. It's really hard to go smoothly between them from one to the next."
64,109,Lauren,"Even though they look like static, they're all their own special flavour of static that has more information we can learn about them."
64,110,Gretchen,"Absolutely. Let's look at vowels. We can move between vowels more easily, maybe, than between the fricatives -- /aaaaa/ /iiiii/ /uuuuu/."
64,111,Lauren,"/aaaaa/ /iiiii/ /uuuuu/ /aaiiuu/. I can see those intensity bands really changing between the different vowels, which is how your brain is beginning to process the difference between something like /a/ and something like /u/."
64,112,Gretchen,"I think you can see the pitch going on more easily. If I go /aaaaa/ [pitch rising and then falling], you can see that pitch go up and down -- /aaaaa/. That's just the same vowel but the pitch changing, whereas going back and forth between /aiaiaiaiai/ you can see those bands go in and out of existence."
64,113,Lauren,That's how acoustic phonetics can help us study things like intonation or languages that have tone differences between words.
64,114,Gretchen,"Or, yeah, things like pitch and stress because often the most stressed syllable of a word or of a phrase is gonna show up really bright on a spectrogram."
64,115,Lauren,I'll try alternating vowels and fricatives so you can really see the difference between the types of visual information they're giving us -- /saaa/ /siii/ /suuu/ /saaa/ /siii/ /suuu/.
64,116,Gretchen,"/sasisu/ /sasisu/ /sasisu/ /sasisu/. [Laughs] You can also see what laughter looks like, which I think is really great. It's got that irregular /ha/ shape."
64,117,Lauren,Very distinct there.
64,118,Gretchen,"The pauses in the middle of laughter is what brings us to stops, which give us that bit of silence in between things. Let's leave a second of silence just to see what silence actually looks like on the spectrogram. [Silence]"
64,119,Lauren,"Because stops are made of nothing, the easiest way to see them is to put them in between some vowels. We'll put them in a little vowel sandwich so that we can see them nice and clearly."
64,120,Gretchen,A little vowel carrier knapsack.
64,121,Lauren,/apa /apa /apa/ /apa/ /ata/ /ata/ /aka/.
64,122,Gretchen,/aba/ /aka/ /aka/ /akakakakak/ /kakakakaka/ /bababababa/ /bə bə bə bə bə/.
64,123,Lauren,So many little moments of nothing that you can see in the spectrogram. You begin to read those absences as stops once you start paying attention to what's happening with a spectrogram.
64,124,Gretchen,The difference between silence and a stop consonant is just like what happens to the vowel when you come out of it.
64,125,Lauren,That's three basic elements of reading a spectrogram with your eyeballs.
64,126,Gretchen,"I feel like I now, in addition to the linguistic spectrogram pub trivia night, I also wanna have a linguistic karaoke night where while you're singing, you're seeing a spectrogram of yourself while singing the karaoke song."
64,127,Lauren,Amazing and distracting.
64,128,Gretchen,"It would be so good, right?"
64,129,Lauren,"Visualising sound waves with a spectrogram is a lot of fun. It is, I should admit, only the first step in doing this kind of phonetic analysis. Usually that analysis involves recording a lot more versions of the same thing or slightly different things and then doing measures on the quantifiable elements of things like how long a sound went for, what the height of those different coloured bands and frequencies were, and they start extracting those numerical values associated with it usually across many, many recordings to arrive at averages and features that they can begin to quantify."
64,130,Gretchen,"Yeah, the visual is really just a tool to begin doing a whole bunch of numerical analysis which is, I think, admittedly, less fun to do on a podcast, but I think it's one of the reasons why phoneticians really care about audio quality because you get so much different things on a spectrogram if you have, say, sound waves being transmitted over the internet compared to something being recorded locally. When you have all this compression going on, you don't see as bright of bands in the parts that are doing really interesting things. That's something that's really relevant if you're trying to do this detailed acoustic analysis."
64,131,Lauren,"These analyses are useful for figuring out exactly why the way that I say a word is different from the way that you say a word, Gretchen, or different people across accents, or people within the same accent. This has uses for things like speech synthesis. In order to synthesise all of the things that are happening with the voice -- or at least enough of the things to sound like speech -- you need to be able to figure out what those different features of the sound are. Acoustic phonetics really helps with that."
64,132,Gretchen,"And one thing that shows up with this is, for example, the way you say the K sound in /ki/ versus in /ka/ or /ku/ is just a little bit different. You can see that show up in the spectrogram because the consonant and the vowel interact. Some of the really early speech synthesis sounded really choppy because they had a /k/ and an /i/ and they didn't have like /ki and /ka/ and /ku/ as things that you could then combine. You need to record way more sequences of all of the different consonant-vowel pairs and triplets and combinations so that when you start synthesising them together, it sounds a bit more natural."
64,133,Lauren,"When people talk about voice fingerprinting, what voice fingerprinting is essentially doing is reading where those coloured bands are for your voice because they relate to your accent, but they also relate to the acoustic properties of your specific voice. They match those up and see if they're close enough to acknowledge that it's you speaking."
64,134,Gretchen,"Which, obviously, has potential for error but is still an interesting thing to be able to try to do."
64,135,Lauren,"There's lots of useful things that spectrograms can do. There are some fun things as well, including manipulating them to make the most of their visual properties."
64,136,Gretchen,"There's a really fun genre of video on YouTube where they take MIDI files of songs, and they play them on what you think of as a dozen pianos that have all the notes. If you recognise the song, you can often hear some sort of weird voice as if it's singing, whereas if you don't recognise the song, you've got nothing."
64,137,Lauren,"We have done this in our bonus episode on linguistic illusions. For the songs that we knew, we could both follow along, and for the songs that we didn't know, it just becomes this absolute noise because the notes are doing that -- where on the scale it is, but the notes of a MIDI keyboard can't do things like fricatives that have that static-y pattern, and they can't do things like the more detailed parts that help us distinguish between different stops. That is what your brain is putting in when it recognises the song."
64,138,Gretchen,"I do think it's kind of cool to think of those dozen pianos playing this song as a halfway point between if you think of the spectrogram as a thousand notes on a musical staff, this is maybe a hundred, which is still giving you some degree of fine resolution in terms of what is actually being produced there."
64,139,Lauren,Those MIDI keyboard illusions made me appreciate even more all of the things that are going on with human speech and why it has taken so much work to understand as much as we know about the human voice.
64,140,Gretchen,"There's also some sort of weird song, right, that used spectrograms as part of the music video for it or as part of the song itself."
64,141,Lauren,"This is a genre of musical play, especially in electronica, where they embed sound in the recording so that it sounds great and it sounds like a song, but when it's played into a spectrogram maker, you can actually see something visual in it. Aphex Twin are really well known for this around 2001. On their Windowlicker album they had a song where you saw a face and you also saw a spiral in the spectrogram if you ran a spectrogram of the song -- but only the version that wasn't an MP3. This wouldn't work for modern music with MP3."
64,142,Gretchen,"Too low resolution. But if you got the high-res version that you ripped off your CDs. I feel like this is a very Winamp thing to do, yeah. The technology that's beginning to exist, so they're like, 'Why not? Let's play with this.'"
64,143,Lauren,"You don't have to do it yourself. We'll link you to some videos. There are other musicians that have played around with this, too. It's not the human speech part of it that's doing it, it's all computer processed and manipulated, but it's also a good indication of how the relationship between the visual information in a spectrogram and the acoustic information in the sound wave interplay."
64,144,Gretchen,"I think that's one of the neat things about spectrograms in general is the history of spectrograms is them getting more and more accessible as a technology. You go from, okay, you need to have this big, heavy, smelly piece of equipment in a lab that produces this paper thing in one shot, to here's a website. You can click on it. You can just experiment and play with spectrograms, and you can make artistic stuff with them. That's a really fun trajectory to see technology go down. [Music]"

65,8,Gretchen,I've been looking up some classic quotes lately.
65,9,Lauren,Have you been looking for some inspiration?
65,10,Gretchen,"Yeah, well, I'm looking for some grammatical inspiration."
65,11,Lauren,"Okay, let me hear some that have been speaking to you."
65,12,Gretchen,"[Clears throat] Best quote-reading voice -- 'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.' 'The pen is mightier than the sword.'"
65,13,Lauren,We're really going for the cliches -- I love it.
65,14,Gretchen,"'Time is money,' Lauren."
65,15,Lauren,"Okay. This might not be the reason other people browse classic quotes lists, but as far as I can tell, you're into all of these because they have 'is' or 'was' in them."
65,16,Gretchen,That's right.
65,17,Lauren,"You're looking for these tiny, little function words."
65,18,Gretchen,"That's absolutely right. I was looking for examples of copulas, and I thought I would try some classic quotes because quotes are sometimes very copular-ific. Can I tell you about my favourite?"
65,19,Lauren,"Yeah, have you got some more?"
65,20,Gretchen,"Okay. This one's the best. It goes, 'Knowledge is power. France is bacon.'"
65,21,Lauren,I think you might have got confused here. I think this is a quote attributed to Francis Bacon.
65,22,Gretchen,"No, no, no, the thing that I am quoting is actually the Reddit thread where somebody realised that they had been mishearing this quote their entire life as 'France-copula-bacon' rather than by a guy named 'Francis' whose surname was 'Bacon.'"
65,23,Lauren,"When I was fact-checking this episode for us, I actually found an entire website franceisbacon.com that exclusively exists that has this anecdote on it. You can buy a t-shirt with the French flag in the shape of a strip of bacon."
65,24,Gretchen,Are not sponsored by franceisbacon.com. [Laughs]
65,25,Lauren,Truly a magic single-serve website -- and a more surreal example of where you might put a copula.
65,26,Gretchen,"In 'France is bacon,' for example, the copula is doing this thing of linking the concept of 'France' to say that it is like, somehow, the concept of 'bacon.' A copula verb is from a Latin word meaning 'linking' or 'joining' or 'combing.' That's what it's doing. It's linking those two halves of the sentence and equating them."
65,27,Lauren,I assume that 'co-' in 'copula' is the same as like in 'combine' and 'coop' -- that 'with' 'co-.'
65,28,Gretchen,"Yes, it is. It is actually related to 'copulate,' as you might wonder, but the grammatical sense is actually older than the other sense."
65,29,Lauren,There you go.
65,30,Gretchen,"There you go. The thing that fascinates me about copulas is that they're this, essentially, one word -- although, 'one word' with an asterisk because 'is' and 'was' and 'were' and 'am' and stuff, and 'be,' are all forms of this one word -- that gets its whole own name in grammatical description."
65,31,Lauren,I hadn't really thought about that before. It reminds me of a schwa -- how we have this one sound that has its own name that has nothing to do with its functions necessarily. It's just so unique in the set of sounds for the schwa and verbs for copulas that they have their own name.
65,32,Gretchen,"Normally, we talk about classes of verbs, you know, maybe these verbs all have both a subject and an object, and these verbs only have a subject, or something like that. You have transitive and intransitive. We often have names for groups of verbs, but 'copula' gets to be its own thing because there isn't really any other verb that's exactly like 'is' and 'was' and that whole class of verbs."
65,33,Lauren,"We should probably just mention as well that they don't have to just occur in profound, inspirational quotes. Copulas pop up all over the place. You have a much more practical use such as, 'Lingthusiasm is a podcast.'"
65,34,Gretchen,"'The Lingthusiasm logo is green.' 'A podcast that is enthusiastic about linguistics,' indeed."
65,35,Lauren,"These are nice because these examples show how the two things that get linked don't have to always be the same types of things. You could link one noun with another noun -- 'Lingthusiasm' is a noun and 'podcast' is a noun. But for something like, 'The logo is green,' that's an adjective, so it's linking a noun to its attribute. Or you could link a noun with a location like, 'The Lingthusiasm transcripts are on the Lingthusiasm website.'"
65,36,Gretchen,Very nice. Or it could be a possession -- 'The Lingthusiasm podcast is ours.'
65,37,Lauren,Exactly. Linking here is a very broad concept of what can be linked.
65,38,Gretchen,"I think the other reason why we have a special name for copulas is because, when it comes to the form of a copula -- like if you wanna talk about 'walk' as a verb, you can just be like, 'Well, the verb, 'walk,' it does the following properties.' But if you wanna try to talk about copula as a verb, you're left saying, 'Well, the verb 'is,' which is also 'was,' which is also 'be,' which is also 'were' and 'am,' and 'being' and 'been.'' It's got so many forms compared to the relatively scarcity of forms that other verbs in English have."
65,39,Lauren,"All these different forms are just part of the paradigm for this one verb. Even though they all look very differently, they're treated as variations on the same verb when we're thinking about how they function."
65,40,Gretchen,"Because many languages -- probably most languages, but I haven't checked all 7,000 -- have some form of copula, and it tends to be a very common thing to do to say that two things are roughly similar to each other, it's a very common verb, so it's more likely to be irregular in a lot of languages than other types of verbs that are a bit less common. It's also useful to have this type of verb when you're doing cross-linguistic comparisons to say, 'How does the copula show up in these particular languages?' Because you're relatively often dealing with a verb that has lots of irregular forms."
65,41,Lauren,"That is maybe a thing you've encountered when leaning a new language is that, for the copula, you're more likely to have to learn more than one way of dealing with it because we put up with a lot of irregularity in verbs that we use all the time. If we had very different forms of the verb 'subscribe' -- we don't use that verb very much -- it would be a lot more effort to retain all those different forms."
65,42,Gretchen,"Exactly. Something that's interesting about the copula forms in, at least, a lot of European languages is that they are often historically drawing some forms from one verb and some forms from another. They've been sort of smooshed together to make this 'Franken-verb.' This is why we have the 'be, been, being' forms, which are originally from one verb that's traced back historically, and the 'was, were' forms, which are traced back to a different verb. I think the 'is, are' forms are from yet a third one. The same thing in French, you have the 'suis -- je suis; tu es; ils est' forms and then also, in the future tense, there's forms with an F in a lot of Romance languages. That was smooshed together from another verb. There's lots of weird stuff going on for historical reasons there."
65,43,Lauren,"Another thing that can make copula hard to spot in the wild with English is that, because they are used so frequently, they get reduced a lot. They can just become even little clitics that stick on to the ends of other words. We have a whole episode on clitics and how they are commonly used forms that get reduced. So, 'She's a really great linguist' -- that /s/ there is the copula as a reduced form. Or 'I'm really enthusiastic about linguistics' -- that /m/ there is that little bit of 'am.'"
65,44,Gretchen,"There's negative forms of the copula, too. You have 'isn't, aren't, wasn't.' One of the things that interests me is that there isn't quite a mainstream English form of 'am not' that's contracted."
65,45,Lauren,"'I am not' -- yeah, that's right. I don't have 'amn't' in my variety of English."
65,46,Gretchen,"'Amn't' is found in Ireland and maybe a few other places, but it's not in my English. I haven't encountered it. Traditionally speaking, historically, if we wanted to use a contracted negation form of 'am' and 'not,' that's actually 'ain't.'"
65,47,Lauren,"Ah, it is true. But 'ain't' has fallen out of favour and ruined the paradigm. It's a very sad tale."
65,48,Gretchen,"'Ain't' has this stigmatised association because it was originally a contraction of 'am not' and totally, reasonably used like that. It also began to be used as a generic contraction of 'are not, is not, has not' and a bunch of other forms. That became associated with representations of stigmatised dialect -- like Dickens representing Cockney. People started getting really angry about it and making it not a thing for as many people anymore. Now we're left with this gap, which I don't think is an improvement, really."
65,49,Lauren,"Between the variety of functions, the irregularity of form, the ability to reduce it in certain contexts, no wonder copulas need their own name. They do so much."
65,50,Gretchen,"They do so much. Again, most of our other verbs don't get their own reduced forms. This is a thing that happens with really frequent stuff."
65,51,Lauren,"Just to make things extra tricky with the copula, I have a couple of quotes to share back to you, Gretchen."
65,52,Gretchen,"Thank you, please."
65,53,Lauren,"'I think, therefore I am.' Of course, we couldn't have a copula episode without talking about 'to be, or not to be.' For both of these, there's no linking happening."
65,54,Gretchen,"There isn't any linking happening. 'I think, therefore I am,' 'to be, or not to be' -- to be what?"
65,55,Lauren,That is the question.
65,56,Gretchen,"[Laughs] Okay, I walked into that. If Hamlet is going around saying, 'to be alive, or not to be alive,' or 'to be Hamlet, or not to be Hamlet,' then he'd be using, technically speaking, a copula in its linking sense. But in 'to be, or not to be' where it's just 'to exist, or not to exist,' that is, technically speaking, not quite a copula because it isn't doing that linking thing. However -- this is a very large 'however' -- because there are quite a few languages -- not every language -- where the copula in the linking sense and the copula in the existing sense are expressed with the same word, you do sometimes get people using the word 'copula' to refer to, maybe, anything that 'is' and 'was' and 'be' can do because it already has this handy word, therefore, is technically speaking one of its functions."
65,57,Lauren,"A good way to check whether it's the exist function is you can replace it with 'I think, therefore I exist,' but we can't replace 'Lingthusiasm exists a podcast.'"
65,58,Gretchen,'France exists bacon.' It's not working for me.
65,59,Lauren,We can see how the copula has a broader set of functions. This is just one particular function in English but a good reminder as well that there is a lot of variation in what copulas can do across languages.
65,60,Gretchen,"In this particular case, 'I think, therefore I am,' which is 'Cogito ergo sum' in Latin, that is also using 'sum,' which is part of the copula verb 'to be' in Latin. You can see how, okay, if you learn that 'sum' is part of the copula in Latin, you might start saying, 'Oh, any of this use of 'am' or 'be' is copulative,' which is sometimes used in this less specific way."
65,61,Lauren,"Another language where the copula is highly irregular. As someone who is trying to learn that paradigm at the moment, I appreciate the benefit of being a native speaker of a language with a highly irregular copula set rather than having to learn it as an adult."
65,62,Gretchen,You don't remember having learned all of the irregular copula forms. There're also some cool things that copula constructions do differently across languages -- or similarly even in languages that aren't necessarily super related to each other. One cool thing you can do with copulas is you can have several of them.
65,63,Lauren,Excellent.
65,64,Gretchen,"Yeah, more copulas are more fun. You can use them, for example, to distinguish between temporary and ongoing states. I think the example that people may have encountered about this is the Spanish 'ser' versus 'estar,' where 'ser' is used for ongoing states and 'estar' is used for things that are considered more temporary. You could have something like, 'Estoy en la Casa,' 'I'm in the house,' which is a temporary state, so I'm using the temporary copula, and 'Soy lingüista,' which is a permanent state -- thank you -- which means, 'I'm a linguist.'"
65,65,Lauren,"Absolutely. Once a linguist, always a linguist."
65,66,Gretchen,"It's used for professions even if, you know, you're a teacher now, you might still use 'ser' for that, even if you change careers in ten years. It's the idea of is this relatively permanent or not permanent. The thing that really delighted me about learning these different verbs is that you can actually use them to distinguish between things that, in English, you would do with the adjective instead. 'Estoy aburrida,' 'I'm bored' --"
65,67,Lauren,"Because that's a temporary state, yeah."
65,68,Gretchen,"Hopefully. But 'Soy aburrida,' which is the same word that I used for 'bored,' is 'I'm boring,' which is an ongoing state."
65,69,Lauren,"That's so much more permanent and intrinsic, right. Okay."
65,70,Gretchen,"The interesting thing is that Spanish and Portuguese are fairly well known for having differences between 'ser' and 'estar,' but also Gaelic. I think several of the other Celtic languages -- although Scottish Gaelic is the one that I know -- also has a distinction that's very much like 'ser' and 'estar' between temporary and ongoing states. You can have something like, 'Tha mi gu math,' where the /ha/, which is spelled T-H-A, is the temporary version of the copula, so, 'I am well,' versus 'Is mise Gretchen,' where the /ɪs/, which sounds very different from /ha/, is the verb meaning, 'I am Gretchen/My name is/Myself is Gretchen.'"
65,71,Lauren,Not a temporary state.
65,72,Gretchen,"Not a temporary state. Even if you change your name, the idea is that names are things that are a little bit more ongoing than wellness, perhaps. Interestingly, you also have this distinction showing up in completely unrelated languages. Chichewa is a Bantu language which is spoken mainly in Malawi and has a permanent versus temporary distinction but only in the present. You can do very similar examples. The permanent example -- and hopefully this is a somewhat accurate pronunciation of the Chichewa -- 'Ine ndine mphunzitsi,' 'I am a teacher,' which is, like being a linguist, an ongoing state even if you retire eventually. Whereas for temporary states, 'Iyé ali bwino,' 'He is well,' which is the same thing with the Gaelic 'I am well.' This is a thing that maybe today you're well, tomorrow you're not well. Knowing about a distinction like this means that you can spot it in a variety of languages."
65,73,Lauren,"And a really good reminder that because copulas appear in so many languages, you can find similar functions across languages from completely different families and in completely different parts of the world because there are thousands of human language experiments with what copulas do happening all around us. When I was learning Nepali, one thing I had to learn to pay attention to in the copulas in Nepali was that they have different levels of politeness depending on the way that you want to convey yourself when communicating with people. There's a distinction between a common form, which can be impolite in some contexts; a middle politeness form, which is a place I hang out a lot; and then a very polite form. If I were to talk about someone I didn't know very well, I would say, 'Australian ho,' 'They are Australian'; for middle politeness, 'Australian hun,' 'They are Australian'; then if I was being polite, I would say, 'Australian hunuhuncha,' which is really just a very satisfying word to say. It's great that being polite is so satisfying in terms of the sound as well as the social status. It's something that happens across the whole verb paradigm, but you just use copulas so much in daily speaking, and it's not something I ever had to think about when using a copula in English."
65,74,Gretchen,"I feel like this is also one of the ways that identify whether or not someone's speaking Japanese. Japanese has these two forms of the copula -- 'da,' which is informal, and 'desu,' which is polite. If you hear people ending their sentences with 'desu' -- because the verb comes at the end in Japanese -- you're like, 'Oh, they're definitely speaking Japanese.' I don't know what they're saying. I don't actually speak Japanese. But I can identify it because you hear, in certain contexts, a lot of these polite copula forms that just keep going through. It's just another place for grammatical stuff to show up. If you have a language that has a grammatical thing going on, the copula would be one place where it happens."
65,75,Lauren,"For example, in Yolmo and Syuba, as we talked about in our episode on evidentiality, this is where in the grammar the evidentials hang out. If you wanna talk about something that you know from ongoing experience or because you have some kind of visual or smell or sound evidence, you would use a different form of the copula and, a bit like the English copula, has some different functions. This can be pulled into other structures where it's not really being used as a copula, it's just coming along for its evidential function."
65,76,Gretchen,"We've been talking a lot about, okay, this language has this word for the copula, this language has many words for the copula, but it's also worth pointing out that sometimes you can have languages do copula functions using constructions that are not actually really traceable to being a copula itself. You can make it do something else. One example of this is from David Bowles on Twitter who tweets a lot about Nahuatl, which is a language that I first used to pronounce /nawatl̩/, but I have since learned to pronounce /nawatɬ/, and is spoken in South America. He says that instead of dropping the copula or using a particular word that's a copula, they treat the noun or the adjective that you want to link with something as a verb by adding a subject prefix to it."
65,77,Lauren,Cool.
65,78,Gretchen,"If you wanna say something -- like 'beautiful' is 'cualtzin.' Hopefully I'm pronouncing that somewhere near accuracy. But if you wanna say, 'You are beautiful,' you would say, 'ticualtzin,' where the ti- is a subject prefix meaning 'you.' You're essentially making 'beautiful' into a verb, you know, 'I beautiful,' 'You beautiful,' 'He or she beautifuls.' Rather than putting a separate word in to link it, you're just treating it like you would any other verb in the language."
65,79,Lauren,That's a really great example of how a copula function can be more than just looking for a copula verb in a language.
65,80,Gretchen,"Which is another reason why it's useful to have a word-like copula to say, ah, here's this function that we can trace through the different strategies that languages use to accomplish it, some of which correspond to particular verbs, and some of which don't."
65,81,Lauren,"I know Auslan doesn't have a specific copula either, which is not to say it doesn't have a copula function. To do a copula, you have the subject, and then you have the other thing that you're linking it with, whether it's a location or an attribute. Word order is very important for establishing a copula relationship. If I wanted to say something like, 'Lingthusiasm is a podcast,' I would sign, 'Lingthusiasm,' and then I would sign, 'podcast.' There are some secondary channels that you can use. Things like your facial expression, you would generally use some raised eyebrows to indicate for the first half that this the topic and then the other bit is what you're linking to it. It's not that it doesn't have a copula function, it's just that you're not looking for a particular single sign that has that function."
65,82,Gretchen,"And it's not that you're just doing these two signs sequentially with nothing indicating that there's any relationship to them because there are the non-manual signs that are on your face and stuff that are indicating, yeah, there's a relationship here that I'm talking about them in juxtaposition with each other."
65,83,Lauren,"Yeah. And I think ASL does something similar. I don't know if it's more common in signed languages because they have this spatial resource to make use of to not need a particular word for the copula function. There might be other signed languages that do have a specific signed copula. I'm sure that for something like Signed English, which is a more literal sign equivalent of English, that there probably is one because you're trying to sign all the English words. But for Auslan, there's no specific copula sign."
65,84,Gretchen,"Nice. This gets us into something that sometimes comes up when you're talking about copulas which is languages that sometimes put the copula and sometimes don't, which is different from the situation in Nahuatl or in Auslan where you do a different type of construction that is not traceable as a single word to being a copula. But in Arabic, for example -- when I was learning Arabic, I studied a bunch of languages before. I was like, yeah, okay, I know that one of the words that's really useful to learn early on is like, 'be' and 'am' and 'is.' Sometimes there's some irregularity, but they're pretty common. I should try to learn these. The textbook and my instructor was like, yeah, no. In Arabic, in the present tense, and if there isn't a negation going on, there just isn't a word for the copula."
65,85,Lauren,"Of course, it's worth being very clear that the fact that there is no word is what makes it meaningful -- that it's a zero copula."
65,86,Gretchen,"Right. It's a zero copula. There isn't a word. If you wanna say something like, 'The book is big,' you could say, 'alkitab kabir,' which is literally, 'the book big,' but you distinguish it from, 'the big book,' which would be 'alkitab alkabir,' which is literally, 'the book the big.' That 'the' is linking it and saying, okay, these are both part of the same noun phrase, whereas, because you didn't have the 'the,' okay, there's an understood copula there. But it's null, and it's not something you literally say. However, if you wanna say, 'The book is not big,' or 'The book was big,' or something like that, then you need to add another verb, 'kāna' or 'laysa,' to indicate the negation or the past tense. There is a copula elsewhere in the language, but in the simplest case of the copula, which is just linking two things in that default, present, no negation going on, no funny business, you juxtaposing the words by itself is enough, and it is, in fact, the only thing that you do."
65,87,Lauren,"The World Atlas of Linguistic Structures has a survey of how common it is to be able to do this zero copula without having a specific copula word there. It's relatively small by WALS standards -- there's, like, 400 languages. In the survey, it's possible to do this zero copula thing like Arabic in about 45% of the languages they surveyed. It's by no means uncommon if you're learning a language and you encounter a zero copula. It does happen in quite a broad range of languages. It's not just like it's a common thing in one particular language family. In fact, Russian is known for having a zero copula in the present tense, which I find really interesting as a Polish speaker, which does have a present copula in that form. So, closely related languages can do different things just as we saw similar things happening across very different and non-related languages. The thing I find really interesting about the Russian one is that, apparently, there was a present tense copula all the way up until the 19th Century. If you read something like Dostoevsky, you'll see this form. But because it's in something like Dostoevsky, now, if people use it, it has this archaic effect when you speak or use it in writing."
65,88,Gretchen,"Sort of like using something from Shakespeare like, 'thou art,' because we're familiar with this from literature, but it's not something that's right there."
65,89,Lauren,"Yes, unfortunately we've lost 'art' from our paradigm just as the Russians have lost their present tense copula. Some languages will have a zero or potentially some stylistic effect from choosing to include it or not."
65,90,Gretchen,"This is a great segue into talking about the zero copula in African American English, which is also an example of this very close contact linguistic variation with Russian and Polish where my variety of English, sort of mainstream North American English, requires a copula in the present tense most of the time -- I'm gonna put an asterisk on this because there's a few contexts where I don't have to do it -- but in African American English, you can have a sentence like, 'Some of them big, and some of them small,' which means, 'Some of them are big, and some of them are small.' But interestingly, there's a lot of constraints on this as well. Again, it's only in the present tense. It's not with negation. And you can't do it with 'am.'"
65,91,Lauren,"Interesting. So, a real consistent grammatical structure to how these copulas get used."
65,92,Gretchen,"Right, which is interestingly similar to how you can't do 'am not,' 'amn't,' with 'am.' There's some weird stuff going on with English 'am.'"
65,93,Lauren,Something about first person that makes everyone very sensitive to their copula use.
65,94,Gretchen,"It's interesting. There's rules around this. When people do terrible parodies of African American English, they often aren't paying attention to the specific constraints on the rules for when you can and can't do this."
65,95,Lauren,"Now, I need to know what contexts you find it's possible to not use a copula."
65,96,Gretchen,"I didn't think I had any examples of null copula, but when we were looking up information about this, I realised there's also a construction in English where you can say something like, 'The more the merrier.'"
65,97,Lauren,"A classic quote, right there."
65,98,Gretchen,"Classic quote. That is a null copula, my friends."
65,99,Lauren,Is it just because of how ubiquitous that saying is?
65,100,Gretchen,"I don't know. There's a few fixed phrases like, 'The more the merrier,' 'The more the better,' that are classic quotes. I don't know if I can do like, 'The more the hungrier.' Can I put other stuff in that context?"
65,101,Lauren,'The later the sleepier'?
65,102,Gretchen,"Yeah, I dunno. It kinda works. It's in that comparative construction where it seems to work. Also, there is a news headline null copula in English."
65,103,Lauren,"Oh my gosh, there is, too."
65,104,Gretchen,"I went and got a few examples of this, unfortunately not from classic quotes because there aren't really classic quotes that are news headlines also."
65,105,Lauren,"Oh gosh, you got them from news headlines. Am I gonna be able to cope with this?"
65,106,Gretchen,I got them from news headlines from The Onion.
65,107,Lauren,"Okay, thank you."
65,108,Gretchen,"For comic value. A few of these are, 'Area Woman Not Yelling at You, She's Just Saying.'"
65,109,Lauren,"I like that one because they've snuck one into the second half, 'She's just saying.' But in any other context I would have to say, 'Area woman is not yelling at you.'"
65,110,Gretchen,Exactly. 'Neighbour Oblivious to Fact He Being Groomed for Cat Sitting.'
65,111,Lauren,"Okay. That one broke my brain. So, 'The neighbour is oblivious to the fact he is being groomed for cat sitting.'"
65,112,Gretchen,"Right. 'Neighbour Oblivious' kind of works as a news headline null copula but 'He Being Groomed,' I think it might be something about the 'he' that's really not quite working as a null copula for me there either."
65,113,Lauren,I think it's also just something about the fact that it's such a not news headline topic that makes it very hard for my brain to take it seriously.
65,114,Gretchen,"I mean, this is something that comes up when you get headlines from The Onion, admittedly. 'Friendship Moving Way Too Fast.'"
65,115,Lauren,'Friendship is moving way too fast' would not sound like a headline in the way this does.
65,116,Gretchen,"Finally, 'Study: More Parents Opting for One Big Baby Over Multi-Child Households,' which has a very weird stock photo."
65,117,Lauren,"That really does sound like a newspaper headline. I thought newspaper headlines mostly came about by removing 'the' or 'a,' but you're right, removing the copula is what really makes them hit as newspaper-vibe. At the start of the episode, we talked about the linking function of copulas and this existence function that they have in English as well."
65,118,Gretchen,"We can think of these as the 'France is bacon' function and the 'to be, or not to be' function, yes."
65,119,Lauren,"These are by no means the only functions that the copula has in English. Because it's this tiny, functional word, it gets picked up in a whole bunch of other uses as well. It's worth just doing a brief tour of some of those."
65,120,Gretchen,"The copula is also sometimes used something like, 'I am eating the cake,' or 'The cake was eaten' -- that 'am' and 'was' are both forms of the verb 'to be.' Sometimes, they get dragged in and said, oh, well, if we say anything that 'to be' is part of the copula, sometimes it'll get talked about as a copula even though technically what they're doing is not quite the same type of linking. Although, an interesting complication that happens there is if you have a sentence like, 'The shirt was torn,' is that referring to the same thing as 'The shirt was green' -- the adjective that I'm applying to the shirt is 'torn'? Or am I saying the shirt was torn by the dog and then it's a verb? You can see why in something like, 'The shirt was torn,' 'The cake was eaten,' you might wanna talk about a copula from a linking perspective even though it's not necessarily gonna be a function that's expressed by a copula in a different language that might actually have a different way of expressing a passive."
65,121,Lauren,"Then on top of all of this, we have other words like, 'become,' which in some contexts have a copula-like function -- so something like, 'I became hungry,' appears to have this linking of two attributes that has a real copula vibe to it."
65,122,Gretchen,"If you have something like 'feel' in 'It feels hot,' or 'seem,' 'Good company makes a trip seem shorter,' if we want to have a quote-y feel. You can sometimes use 'be' in place of them, you know, 'It is hot,' 'I am tired,' 'makes a trip become shorter,' or 'be shorter.' There's words you can use in some contexts as a synonym for 'be' that also provide that kind of link."
65,123,Lauren,"We have a term for these. They're called 'pseudo-copulas' because they're kinda doing a copula thing but not always and not with that specific set of functions that copula verbs have -- but worth keeping an eye out for them, anyway."
65,124,Gretchen,"When I think about copulas, I also remember a game that I used to play with some friends in high school. One of my friends had discovered this proposal for a philosophical language form called 'E-Prime.' This was a form of English -- which is the 'E' -- which doesn't use any of the forms of the verb 'to be.'"
65,125,Lauren,"Okay. Having now spent a good half an hour chatting about the forms of this verb, this feels like quite a mental exercise."
65,126,Gretchen,"Right. There's some level of philosophical justification of like, maybe this will make your thoughts clearer because if you say, 'The sky is blue,' what you really mean is, 'The sky appears blue to me,' and so you should basically be using pseudo-copulas, as we just talked about, instead of a proper copula because how do you know the sky is really blue, and shouldn't you be watching what you assert."
65,127,Lauren,It's really forcing you to make use of those pseudo-copulas because they fit into a lot of those constructions very nicely.
65,128,Gretchen,"I think maybe there's an interesting point to be made about being very precise in terms of what you can state as true. Also, one of the things that we realised over the course of a few different lunch breaks playing this game of what-if-we-didn't-use-the-verb-to-be is that there's all these other forms 'to be' has that are probably not really required to be omitted in order for greater intellectual precision and clarity of thought as the grandiose claims go. If you say something like, 'I am eating,' are you really being less precise than, 'I eat'?"
65,129,Lauren,I imagine it helps you focus your thinking by basically completely freezing you up sentence to sentence because you have to think about all these different functions. A function word is something we tend to take for granted in our vocabulary.
65,130,Gretchen,"Right, exactly. It's kind of like -- I subsequently played an improv game where you can't use any words with the letter S in it just to mess with you. I think it works better as a game of just-to-mess-with-you of what-if-you-thought-about-your-linguistic-forms-a-lot and tried to play this kind of Gotcha! game than actually -- I don't think it gave us any additional philosophical clarity while we were playing it."
65,131,Lauren,"If you're writing some sci-fi at the moment, it would be really fun to have the aliens make it through the whole book using no copulas in English translation. They have to speak E-Prime."
65,132,Gretchen,"That would be interesting! You do sometimes get people writing books without the letter E or something, so I think you could do it as a written exercise in a way that's a lot harder to do in real time."
65,133,Lauren,"This was a delightfully philosophical ending to our discussion about copulas. Since we started with inspirational quotes, should we maybe finish with some inspirational quotes and change some to be able copulas?"
65,134,Gretchen,I absolutely think we should change some philosophical quotes to be about copulas. I wanna say that 'Life is like a box of copulas.'
65,135,Lauren,Very profound. 'You must be the copula you wish to see in the world.' [Music]

66,7,Gretchen,"Lauren, I have a fun fictional story for you. Do you wanna hear it?"
66,8,Lauren,"I do, yeah."
66,9,Gretchen,All right. This is a Choose Your Own Adventure story. You can choose which direction it happens. One of these stories is Lauren gets on a plane. She comes to visit Gretchen in Montreal.
66,10,Lauren,What's my other choice?
66,11,Gretchen,The other is Gretchen gets on a plane. She visits Lauren in Melbourne.
66,12,Lauren,"These are both excellent choices to make. But in one of them I have to get tickets. I have to pack a bag, which I possibly don't know how to do anymore. I have to turn up in Montreal. I have to make sure that I've got clothes for the right season. In the other scenario, I'm just making sure that I have a lot of Tim Tams and waiting for you to turn up. They are two very different scenarios."
66,13,Gretchen,"They involve very different things on your part. We end up in a similar end state that we get to hang out -- which this is a fantasy scenario; this is not happening for a while -- but we end up in a similar end state of we get to hang out, but the 'Do I get on a plane? Am I packing my bags? Am I looking up what should I do about the drop bears when I get to Australia?' or am I just laying in my supply of Timbits, which I think must be the Canadian equivalent of Tim Tams, right."
66,14,Lauren,Sounds about right.
66,15,Gretchen,It's a different sort of scenario.
66,16,Lauren,"That's all because in one scenario Lauren visits Gretchen, and in the other one, Gretchen visits Lauren."
66,17,Gretchen,"This is a nice segue into why it's important to be able to distinguish between these two scenarios. In English, we do that using the order of the words in a sentence. We have the same words in 'Lauren visits Gretchen' and 'Gretchen visits Lauren,' but we put them in a different order. We know who's getting on the plane and who's sitting around there waiting for the doorbell to ring."
66,18,Lauren,"It's possible that we could use some other way of keeping track of who is doing the travelling by tagging the 'Lauren' and the 'Gretchen' in the sentence in different ways that indicates that -- that doesn't rely on what order the words go in. We could have something like, 'To Lauren visits Gretchen,' and that 'to' there is helping us keep track of which one is doing the travelling."
66,19,Gretchen,"Exactly. We could use a different order of words as long as we all agree on the order. We could say, 'Gretchen Lauren visits,' something like that, or 'It's Lauren that visits Gretchen.' We could use various other things to keep track of who's doing what to who, who's the visitor, who's the visitee, and keep track of that information in some way. In English, if we do it with pronouns, we have different forms. You could say, 'She visits her,' but unfortunately, that's still ambiguous in our context."
66,20,Lauren,"It's a really nice reminder that grammar is really just an agreement between all of the people who use that language. Are we a language that's using the order of the words, and in that case, what order have we agreed? Or are we a language that uses some kind of tagging system?"
66,21,Gretchen,"Or some sort of combination of the two. I think that this is one of those things where sometimes you can use context to tell what's going on. If I have a sentence like, 'I eat chocolate,' I don't think that's really ambiguous if I scramble the order of the words. 'Chocolate eats me' is just not an interpretation you're very likely to get out of it even if I say --"
66,22,Lauren,"Unless you're in a world with some animate human-eating chocolate bars which, thankfully, that is not a fictional Choose Your Own Adventure we have to do today."
66,23,Gretchen,"You don't have to fear the killer chocolate. Or 'I like linguistics' -- 'Linguistics likes me'? I dunno. This seems like an implausible thing that I can conclude from this set of words. Some of the things that having grammar lets us do is communicate these types of scenarios where you genuinely could have either of us in either order -- either of us could be doing the visiting here -- or communicate surprising things or interesting things. I think the classic example is like, 'A dog bites a man' is not a news headline, but 'A man bites a dog' is a news headline. I'd like to think about it in terms of killer chocolate, you know. 'The chocolate eats me' -- you can actually communicate surprising or fantastical or curious things because grammar exists, and we're not just reliant on determining what the most sensible or logical meaning is based on the actual meanings of the words."
66,24,Lauren,"There was actually a study that looked at this in 30 different languages and found that for those examples like, 'I eat chocolate,' where it's really obvious, people would actually be able to guess even without any of the grammar available. But for that 10-15% of sentences where it wasn't clear because it was two equal status things like, 'Lauren and Gretchen,' who's doing what, or where it was examples like, 'Man bites dog,' which are surprising to us. Grammar is so important whether that's putting things in a particular order or tagging things or some combination of that."
66,25,Gretchen,"10-15% of sentences that are actually confusing if you don't know the grammar and you're only paying attention to the meanings of the words -- it might not seem like a lot, but it's enough that -- I think every language we've been encountered with has some way of distinguishing between these two types of entities because they're often important things to be able to communicate such as things that are happening between two people or things that are happening that are surprising that you aren't expecting or fantastical or storytelling, things like that. This is not the majority of things you do with a sentence, but it's a really important sub-case of things you do with a sentence."
66,26,Lauren,A good quantification of just how frequently we really do need grammar to make things make sense.
66,27,Gretchen,"Yeah. Studies like this are interesting because they tend to look at this very simplified version of what a sentence is. It's got a subject -- that's 'me.' It's got the verb -- that's 'eat.' It's got the object -- that's 'chocolate.' That's a very simple sentence. Many of the sentences that we say in conversation are not that simple. They're doing other things. They're in a chain of sentences where you have the same person who's carrying through the entire story. You have other stuff going on. We look at this very stylised representation of this 'I eat chocolate'/ 'Gretchen visits Lauren' type sentence which is very simplified. Sometimes there's extra, additional complexities going on once you start talking about things that are happening in conversation or in more complicated sentences or in poetry or writing or other types of contexts where other stuff can happen. The one that I think of is -- so English, okay, it goes subject-verb-object. That seems really clear. But then you can say something like, 'Chocolate, I like, but chips, I can really take or leave them.' Now you have 'Chocolate, I like,' and that's object and then the subject and then the verb. As soon as you start looking at things in context, there's already places where it begins to break down."
66,28,Lauren,Different languages will have different places that that breaks down or different things that they tend to do. This is why this concept of word order is something that gets paid attention to and that we look at across different languages.
66,29,Gretchen,"While we're talking about word order -- because there are tendencies that languages have, whether stronger or weaker tendencies -- it's also just as valid to mark who's doing what to who by tagging each of the words with what its role is in the sentence. This is sometimes traditionally talked about as 'case marking,' but I like to think of it as adding a tag or -- do you want a metaphor?"
66,30,Lauren,Sure.
66,31,Gretchen,You can think about it as sort of like different ways to organise your desk.
66,32,Lauren,Okay.
66,33,Gretchen,"If you've got a bunch of different papers that belong to some of the different courses that you teach, how would you organise those?"
66,34,Lauren,"I'd like to have them in piles. I sometimes like those little desk sorters that have the little stackers that let me put different things in different places. If I'm teaching Intro to Linguistics, I'll have it one pile here. And then I'll have my pile of papers for Syntax sitting next to it."
66,35,Gretchen,"Right. Another thing you could do, which I do a lot, is colour-code things. You could say, okay, all the red ones are gonna be intro linguistics. I'm gonna use this colour Post-it note, or I'm gonna use this colour pen, or this colour highlighter, this colour binder, which combines the two -- of spatial and colour -- and put things in a particular colour."
66,36,Lauren,"I like a bit of colour-coding, but I really need to know where things are."
66,37,Gretchen,I think of the colour-coding as like adding on this tag that tells each word what its role is in the sentence and the 'Let's put things in different piles' as 'Let's use word order to tell what thing's going on here.'
66,38,Lauren,It's important to say neither is better or worse. They're just different strategies for figuring out where things are just the same when it comes to tagging or word order for sentence structure.
66,39,Gretchen,"Exactly. It's something that's interesting when you start looking at human languages is, in principle, any order of subject and verb and object would work just as well for -- as long as everybody agrees, you know who's doing what to who. You could put the object at the beginning. You could put the verb in the middle and the subject at the end. Like, 'Chocolate like I' -- you're not really confused about what's going on here. I mean, it would mean that 'Gretchen visits Lauren' actually means 'Lauren visits Gretchen,' but that's only confusing because we're doing with our English brain on. In principle, as long as we all agree, we could do it in that order, too. This is where looking at a whole bunch of languages is really interesting because if each of these orders was just a random bit of consensus, you might expect that like, okay, there're six possible orders, a group of languages would be about a sixth with each of these. But that's not what we see."
66,40,Lauren,It's not a random roll of the dice when it comes to word order. We find that there are some that are more common than others. I think the biggest overall tendency is that the subject tends to come before the object.
66,41,Gretchen,"This makes sense if you think about what's going on in that 'Lauren visits Gretchen' scenario. If you're visiting me, I'm sitting at home, and hours before you even show up, you've got to get to the airport. You've got to get on the plane. You've got to sit there. And then you arrive at my door. In the meantime, half an hour before you're showing up, I'm like, okay, I guess I'll put my nice clothes on or something, put the kettle on five minutes before you show up. If you're the subject, you're potentially doing the action or starting to do the action before the object gets affected by that action."
66,42,Lauren,A bit like the poor chocolate bar doesn't have to do anything and gets eaten.
66,43,Gretchen,"Yeah. If I'm eating the chocolate, I've made the decision to eat the chocolate, reach for the chocolate, grab the chocolate, bring it to my mouth before the eating of the chocolate happens to the chocolate."
66,44,Lauren,Subjects 'tend' to -- we're using that word a lot in this episode -- be the more active thing that is doing a thing with the verb.
66,45,Gretchen,"It's often the case that subject goes before the object. But then the verb within that can be before them, between them, after them, all of these show up relatively commonly, especially those cases where you have the verb between the subject and the object or the verb at the end. There's still quite a few languages that do verb at the beginning but not quite as much. There's a lot less languages that put the object before the subject regardless of where the verb is going."
66,46,Lauren,"The World Atlas of Linguistic Structures has a chapter on word orders where they've looked at common word orders across 1,300 languages. Should we have a look at what the distribution of some of those common tendencies are?"
66,47,Gretchen,"Yeah, let's look at the map. We'll link to the map as well if you wanna look at it yourself. They've got blue dots for subject-object and then verb at the end. They've got red dots for subject-verb-object. That's what English does. Both of these are really commonly found on this map."
66,48,Lauren,I feel like saying lots of Ss and Vs and Os is going to get confusing. Let's talk about each of these categories in terms of the order of actual words. The 'I linguistics love' category --
66,49,Gretchen,Great example
66,50,Lauren,"-- is the most common. It's 42%. If you speak Japanese or Turkish or a Ryukyuan language, you will recognise this word order."
66,51,Gretchen,"This is also the word order found in Tamil, Azerbaijani, several sign languages in Europe, in the Netherlands, German Sign Language, and Italian Sign Language, but also, we could just keep going because there's like 500-plus languages on this list. So, name a language, maybe it's SOV."
66,52,Lauren,"Similarly, 36% of the languages -- almost 500 languages in the survey -- are the 'I love linguistics' model. English speakers will recognise this as the word order that they use for this sentence but also many of the Bantu languages, Indonesian, Khmer, and Hong King Sign Language, and ASL, as well as Brazilian Sign Language."
66,53,Gretchen,"These are really the two big ones as far as word order goes. You have the subject before the object and then the verb either between them or at the end. If I'm encountering a new language, and it uses one of those two word orders, I'm like, 'Yeah, okay, cool, that makes sense.' There is still a decent-sized group -- this is almost 100 languages in the WALS set -- which has the verb at the beginning. This is 'Love I linguistics.' I'm familiar with this order because it's the word order for Scots Gaelic, but it's also the case for other Celtic languages -- Welsh, Irish. I'm not sure if 100% of them, but definitely it seems to be common in the Celtic family."
66,54,Lauren,Manx Gaelic as well but also languages beyond that family includin
66,55,Gretchen,"Zapotec, Biblical Hebrew and Classical Arabic, and Filipino."
66,56,Gretchen,"Nice. You get the three less common ones. These are all the ones that have the object before the subject -- 'Love linguistics I,' 'Linguistics love I,' and 'Linguistics I love.'"
66,57,Lauren,"They all have a small handful of examples compared to the other word orders, but I think it's worth pointing out that those languages come from across different language families. It's not just that it's one family that has a habit of doing it this way, it's something that speakers of languages have come to agree upon in a variety of different places."
66,58,Gretchen,"Especially that 'Love linguistics I' word order, which is the most common of these uncommon ones, it's found in Fijian, it's found in Salish languages, in Mayan languages -- several different groups of languages that haven't necessarily had contact with each other."
66,59,Lauren,"The 'Linguistics love I' word order only has 11 noted languages in WALS, but it's also the word order for Klingon because Marc Okrand, when he was creating the language, deliberately chose one of the statistically least common word orders, which was a lot of his decision-making process for Klingon -- what do we not find as common in human spoken languages -- and made those choices for Klingon. That's why you find Klingon with the 'Linguistics love I' word order."
66,60,Gretchen,"The 'Linguistics I love' word order, which is also found in a few -- only four -- languages in WALS, but there're possibly a few others that haven't made it to WALS yet. It's found in also some languages scattered in various places around the world and also may be familiar to English speakers as the word order that Yoda uses."
66,61,Lauren,"Ah, yeah. That is definitely not standard English word order."
66,62,Gretchen,"You can use it in English in certain contrastive contexts, which I feel like is also why it's relatively easy for us to understand Yoda. You know, the sort of 'Chocolate, I love, but broccoli, I'm less fond of,' or something like that. What this means is -- very conveniently for translating Yoda-speak into various languages -- that a lot of different languages can use this same word order, object-subject-verb, because it's so typologically uncommon that the large languages that big major motion pictures are likely to be translated to also don't have this word order."
66,63,Lauren,"Amazing. So, Yoda, across languages, tends to share this commonality of word order, and because it's so uncommon, it feels interesting to most people."
66,64,Gretchen,"Again, like with the Klingon thing, deliberately using something that's typologically uncommon. The other thing that I'm noticing when I'm looking on this map is that sometimes languages are listed with a particular word order, and if you actually know that language, you might be like, 'Ahhh, yes, but also no.' The first language that I noticed for this is French which is listed in WALS as subject-verb-object. This is kind of true because in French if you're saying a sentence like, 'Je mange le chocolat,' which is, 'I eat chocolate,' that is 'je,' which is 'I,' and 'mange,' which is 'eat,' and 'chocolate' you may be able to tell is at the end. But if you wanna say, 'I eat it,' or really any sentence where the object is a pronoun like that -- 'I see her' or 'I like him' or something like that -- all of these are gonna put the object before the verb instead. The actual story for French is like, oh, well, sometimes it's this order, and sometimes it's this other order. You can tell based on what else is going on in the sentence. The actual-actual story for French -- so that's what I learned in school which is, okay, there's these two word orders, and it depends on whether you have a full object or an object that's reduced to a pronoun. I was like, 'Cool! So, I speak French now.' Then I started talking to people in Montreal, and I found that the thing that helped me the most in terms of actually making conversation with people was something that I had happened to read in one sentence of a linguistics textbook once which was that actually conversational French uses a different type of word order which is called 'topic-comment.' I had this thing where I moved to Montreal, and I went to the farmer's market, and I was trying to by some rhubarb, and I wanted to know if it was rhubarb season yet. I was going around and asking the venders, 'Do you have any rhubarb?' -- 'Est-ce que vous avez de rhubarbe?' -- or 'Is the rhubarb available yet?' They would answer me, but it would always take them a few seconds, and I could watch that confusion. I thought, 'Well, maybe my accent isn't very good,' but also maybe I'm not doing this thing that I read about once in a linguistics book which was how could I make French more topic-comment. The topic of my sentence in this case is 'rhubarb,' and the comment that I want to make about it is, 'Do you have any?' I started asking them, 'De rhubarbe, vous en avez?', which is like, 'Rhubarb, do you have any?' The 'any' in there is referring back to 'rhubarb,' so it's still in there in the sentence, but it's doing this thing where I pull out the most important noun or group of nouns, noun phrase, to comment about. This made people much happier and much more easy to understand me. I was like, this is not the way that I would write French, and this is not the French I learned in school, but it is the word order that conversational French is more likely to follow."
66,65,Lauren,"It's a similar story for the discussion around word order in a lot of the sign language literature, even though there has been some discussion about standard word order. Generally, signed languages follow the same standard word order as spoken languages in terms of frequency. It's either 'I love linguistics' or 'I linguistics love.' But a lot of people have also suggested that this topic-comment approach, which works really well in the visual-spatial modality, is actually much more common and so pervasive that maybe this word order thing isn't as important for signed languages."
66,66,Gretchen,"I think it's also a thing to think about when it comes to, you know, like in writing, you're more likely to have a sentence that maybe has two full nouns in it, and you wanna say, 'Here's what I'm talking about,' whereas in speech or in sign, you're more likely to be saying something that follows on from something that you were just saying. You're in a conversation, and the person who's in the conversation with you has this conversational context with you. You're more likely to be able to say a sentence -- like sometimes you'll see descriptions of languages in the typological literature that's like, 'It's hard to tell what the word order is in this language because we don't have a lot of sentences that have both a full subject and a full object because often one of these is not new information, and so it can be inferred from context, and so it doesn't get stated.' That's realistically how a lot of conversation happens, so it can be hard to construct this very written language style example of 'Lauren visits Gretchen,' whereas in conversation, if we were talking about this, we'd be like, 'Hey, I've been thinking about what I'm going to be doing for the next year or two. Would you be interested in a visit?' or 'What's going on?' You'd be constructing the scenario of who is your story about and then you'd be like, 'Yeah, I really miss Lauren. I wanna visit her.' I would bring in Lauren as the topic and then comment about it in that 'I wanna visit her"" example of that. It's this interesting complexity level that comes when you're talking about written versus conversation -- whether that's spoken or signed conversation -- in terms of what those language formats can do."
66,67,Lauren,"A really good reminder that this kind of typology mapping of what languages do what tends to be a simple version of the story. It's still an interesting story that we tend to put the subject before the object, but it is just part of the story. We see this, I think, specifically in the category that we haven't discussed yet which is that some languages don't have a dominant word order. In fact, 14% of the languages in that WALS survey fall into this category, but this category can mean a lot of different things."
66,68,Gretchen,"If this category was listed in terms of frequency, this would be right after those two big 'I love chocolate'/ 'I chocolate love,' those two big categories, the next one would be 'no dominant order.' There's a lot of things that 'no dominant order' can mean. One of them is maybe you have this topic-comment thing, or you're tagging the words for what relationship they have to each other, and so you don't need to use any order, and you can use the order to mean something different. Another thing it can mean is that there are some orders that are used in some contexts versus another. This was something that came up for me when I was learning German because it seems to be, when you look at German, that there's all sorts of different ordering things it can do. The principles there aren't quite as simple as, okay, here's where the subject goes, here's where the object goes."
66,69,Lauren,Do you have a German sentence to share with us?
66,70,Gretchen,"I'm going to translate our chocolate sentence -- 'Ich liebe Schokolade,' 'I love chocolate.' This may feel familiar to you as an English speaker."
66,71,Lauren,"I am going with 'Schokolade' being 'chocolate,' and 'ich' is 'I.' So, easy to see there the order is 'I love chocolate.'"
66,72,Gretchen,"Exactly. Then you get other stuff that comes up if you add additional words, if you add additional words at the beginning, or if you add additional verbs. In a sentence like, 'Gestern, habe ich Schokolade gegessen,' so 'gestern' is the word for 'yesterday.' This translates -- literally word-by-word it would be, 'Yesterday, have I chocolate eaten.'"
66,73,Lauren,"Here we have 'I' and 'chocolate' are next to each other as the subject and object, and the verb is in a different position."
66,74,Gretchen,"Right. Part of the verb, the 'have' part, is before them, after 'gestern,' and part of the verb is at the end. There's a couple things going on here. One of them is that German really likes to have the verb in the second position of the sentence no matter what else is around it."
66,75,Lauren,"Okay. 'I love chocolate' -- it looks like an English word order, but it's actually a I'm-the-verb-and-I'm-second order."
66,76,Gretchen,"Right. English actually can do this too, especially in a more poetic register. You know, 'Yesterday, ate I chocolate' is maybe not a particularly typical English sentence, but you can say in English something like, 'Often have I wandered the fields of gold.'"
66,77,Lauren,"I mean, if we were keeping in the theme of this episode, it would be, 'Often have I wandered the fields of chocolate,' but your point still stands. It feels like, as you say, a very poetic way of speaking, but it doesn't feel like it's not grammatical for me."
66,78,Gretchen,"This is part of English's history as a Germanic language that we used to do this more, and then with additional French influence, we developed this more consistent, plain subject-verb-object thing. Also, you have certain contexts where the verb or parts of the verb go at the end of the sentence. What's really going on is you need to put one part of the verb in the second position and then everything else in the verb goes at the end. I can see why in a map like WALS you would just sort of, okay, we're gonna give German a grey dot and say, 'no dominant word order' because there's actually this complicated thing where the verb goes at the end except for all the times when it shows up in second position. You can't represent that in a dot compared to all of the other languages that are doing slightly different things with their dots. Each of those grey dots, which is like 14% -- nearly 200 languages -- in this dataset that have no dominant order, has some sort of story, probably, in terms of what that actually looks like when you're going down and seeing what that is."
66,79,Lauren,That German story of there being two main ways of doing things is very different to the Latin story where Latin uses that tagging case marking system and therefore is even more flexible in terms of the order that these words can go in.
66,80,Gretchen,"When I was studying Latin, I would sometimes be asked to translate something that was from poetry or something. The subject would be on one line, and the verb's on another line, and the only way you can tell that they're related to each other is because of the endings that they have. This can be used for poetic effect, and you can do all sorts of interesting things with metre and with rhythm and which sounds are next to each other for artistic effect, but because you can recover this information -- that's got one thing going on. Latin has tendencies in ordinary writing, especially prose where the verb often goes at the end -- but it's very much off and very fudgeable."
66,81,Lauren,"I imagine in spoken Latin at lot of those putting-the-thing-that-I-want-you-to-pay-attention-to-at-the-front tendencies tend to be stronger. It must be a bit of a relief as a student that you're generally dealing with written Latin poetry, so you have the time to put together those bits that should be and have been split up for poetic reasons."
66,82,Gretchen,"Unfortunately, you're not on the streets of Rome trying to ask Caesar where the library is or something like that."
66,83,Lauren,It's really interesting that Latin and French contrast in this way where the formal Latin has the more flexible word order in terms of usage.
66,84,Gretchen,"Oh, yeah, that's true. I mean, they're related to each other. I think word order is the kind of thing that sometimes captures people's attention because even languages that are related to each other sometimes end up acquiring different word orders -- even relatively related languages."
66,85,Lauren,"You really have to take a language-specific approach to word order and what's influencing it. We've discussed a variety of ways that word order gets influenced. Another one that I really like is when you have to look at the animacy of the things that are involved in the sentence. This happens in quite a few languages. Sesotho is one that I have an example for, for you."
66,86,Gretchen,"Ooo, yes, please show it to me."
66,87,Lauren,"If you say, 'I cooked food for the child,' the word order has to be 'I cooked child food' because the child is animate. But if you have something like, 'I cooked food for the feast,' the feast is not animate. The word order can be more flexible, and 'feast' can come before or after 'food' -- so 'I cooked feast food' or 'I cooked food feast' as a literal translation. Either of them work. But for an animate object, it changes the restrictions that you have in terms of word order."
66,88,Gretchen,"That's neat. There's all sorts of factors that you can use whether it's French 'Is this a pronoun or not?' or 'Is this animate or not?' It's also not every factor that you could possibly conceive of. There seem to be some that languages converge around, which probably has something to do with which things people find interesting or worth talking about. Because of this additional level of complexity when it comes to word order, there's been a bit of a movement in more recent years to move away from saying, 'Okay, this language is absolutely subject-verb-object,' 'This language is absolutely subject-object-verb,' because for a lot of languages it's more of a tendency. Instead, you can graph a bunch of languages of like, 'This language is 80% subject-object-verb,' 'This language is 75% this particular word order,' 'This language is 50%' or something like that. There's a really neat graph, which we can link to, that has proportion of the order where the subject goes first. That's the 'I chocolate' order. Way up at the top at virtually 100% is Indonesian, and then French, and then English and Danish, where it's always or almost always the case that the subject is first. Then towards the bottom the language that is most likely to have the object first at least of the languages that were in this particular study is Lithuanian, and then Hungarian and Tamil, which are still more than 50%. It's still more likely you're gonna have the 'I' before the 'chocolate,' but for Lithuanian, for example, it's only 60% likely that you're gonna do them in that order. There's a whole gradient of languages that are around this 75-80-85-90% all the way up. It's less like an absolute -- like you absolutely must have this word order -- and more like a 'This is a tendency, and languages can fall in different places on this continuum.' [Music]"

67,1,Lauren,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics! I'm Lauren Gawne."
67,2,Gretchen,"I'm Gretchen McCulloch. Today, we're getting enthusiastic about how policies affect language. But first, we had an online liveshow!"
67,3,Lauren,Thanks to patrons who attended our liveshow Q&A on the Lingthusiasm Discord.
67,4,Gretchen,"It was so much fun to talk about swearing with you, hear some of your favourite swear words in various languages, and more. This episode will also be available as our May bonus episode on Patreon if you wanna listen to a slightly more edited version."
67,5,Lauren,Our most recent bonus episode was an interview with Nicole Holliday and Ben Zimmer of Spectacular Vernacular where we talked about linguistics and language games.

67,7,Lauren,I've been thinking about the Rosetta Stone lately.
67,8,Gretchen,Okay. Are you planning on starting a new career as an Egyptologist?
67,9,Lauren,"No, it's just a very interesting artefact because of the languages that it's written in. It has three languages on this big stone slab. Up at the top you have Egyptian hieroglyphs, and then you have a language called Demotic, which is a more alphabetic form of the same language that the hieroglyphs were in, and then down the bottom you have Greek."
67,10,Gretchen,"The Rosetta Stone is famous, right, because it has these two different versions of the same language. This is what enabled more recent researchers to crack what the hieroglyphs actually stood for and realise that these symbols that look like birds and people and baskets and stuff like that actually stand for sounds in most cases and figure out how to read all of the other hieroglyphic inscriptions."
67,11,Lauren,It's also a really interesting symbolic document because the choice of these three languages tell us a lot about what young King Ptolemy V was dealing with in terms of the politics of the country when he created the Rosetta Stone and other announcement tablets like this.
67,12,Gretchen,"That's right. I mean, it was useful for scholars later, but King Ptolemy V wasn't thinking, 'I'm gonna make this document that's gonna be super useful for scholars later to decipher this writing system that they don't know.' Why was he making this tri-alphabetic, bilingual document?"
67,13,Lauren,"The Greek down the bottom was the language that his government used. That was his usefulness having the announcement in Greek. But he also needed the locals to be able to read the text, so that's why it's in Demotic. The Egyptian hieroglyphs are there because that was the language of the gods. He wanted to impress upon people that he had the willingness of the Egyptian priests. The fact that this announcement came out of Memphis -- which is where the priests were, not Alexandria, where he was ruling from -- really shows just how much this is a political document and that the choice of these languages was part of the policy of language that he had to keep everyone as happy as possible about his rule."
67,14,Gretchen,"If you're an average, Egyptian person at the time, you aren't necessarily literate in hieroglyphs yourself, but you're used to seeing them around in official inscriptions. So, him putting hieroglyphs on this stone is like, 'Don't worry, guys. I'm still doing the official thing. I'm still ruling the right way by doing the way that respects the traditions of antiquity that you're used to seeing.'"
67,15,Lauren,"'But I'm also Modern, and I'm Greek at the same time.' He's doing all of this in a single announcement document."
67,16,Gretchen,"He's not overtly saying any of this, but it's by putting it in all three languages that it affectively says this."
67,17,Lauren,"Yes, the choices that a government makes about what languages it uses says a lot about that government's policy towards the linguistic environment that it's in."
67,18,Gretchen,"It's really interesting that, in our day and age, the Rosetta Stone is this symbol of translation or of the key to deciphering or understanding something, but it also starts out as a document that's also got this symbolic nature, it's just that what it symbolises is quite different at the time."
67,19,Lauren,Absolutely. It's a really good reminder that the choice of language that gets made in public spaces says a lot about the policy of a government of the day.
67,20,Gretchen,"It says who has power, who has access to power, and which types of groups a government or policy-making body is trying to recognise. I feel like I was sensitive to this at a young age because I was sort of sitting there at breakfast reading the back of the milk carton or reading the back of the cereal box and seeing all the bilingual labelling in English and French, which is very much a Canadian political choice to say, 'If you're gonna make a packaged good, it needs to say all of the information on it in both of the two official languages of the Canadian government.' I ended up learning words like 'carbohydrate' or 'oats' or something in French at this fairly early age because they're right there on the cereal box, and you might as well pick them up as you're reading things. It's also this very state-sponsored and nation-building form of bilingualism as policy."
67,21,Lauren,"That's quite a depth of bilingualism. I was surprised when I went to Canada. It really is the entire ingredients list and the manufacturer's details are presented in both languages. It's not just the main name of the product. It really is full and comprehensive, public bilingual signage. I compare that to a community service centre that I used to access that had this wonderful wall when you walked in where it said, 'Welcome,' in all of these different languages. We used to entertain ourselves by figuring out how many of them we knew. But once you accessed the service, you were really given the choice to only access the service in English. This very superficial, decorative multilingualism that existed on the wall but didn't exist in any of the ways that you interacted with the service is a very different approach."
67,22,Gretchen,"I mean, I would say that we have those 20-language signs that are just as decorative in Canada. That does not mean that you actually get to talk to somebody in all 20 of those -- especially hilariously, when those signs contain typos and have Arabic script that doesn't render properly because the left-to-right encoding and the right-to-left encoding aren't matching in the graphics programme that someone was using, which really underlines the very performative nature of language as decoration in a public space rather than actually trying to be language as communicative because they clearly had no one who even knew anything about, say, Arabic or Persian looking at this sign and saying, 'This script is not displaying correctly.'"
67,23,Lauren,I think that underlines the importance of not just having things in language but having things be about language as well and actually having the support for people to access community services in a language that works for them as well as having stuff decoratively in language.
67,24,Gretchen,"It's interesting because there's an aspect to which having French on the signs definitely raised the perceived value of French in my childhood and the sort of 'Stay in French class, kids, because it'll help you get a job later if you wanna get a job with the government.' There is this performative aspect to making language supported by policy, but then that has to be backed up by commitment to the actual people who live and use that language and not just sort of the 'Okay, we're gonna stick it on the sign for aesthetic value but clearly there's nobody here who actually knows whether this language is backwards or not.' I mean, literally, physically backwards not some sort of slur."
67,25,Lauren,"I think there are times where just having the visibility of language at all is a really powerful policy statement. In my home state of Victoria, in Australia, over the last few years, there's been a handful of really important environment bills that have gone through the state government that have included a preface or part of the law in one of the local Indigenous languages. The 2017 Yarra River Protection Act -- it's the river that flows right through the capital city of Victoria, Melbourne -- is in English, but it has a preface in the Woi-wurrung language, which is the language of the Wurundjeri people whose land Melbourne is situated on. The title of the bill is also given in Woi-wurrung in that document. It's really exciting to see Victorian languages be visible in this way when they haven't been for over a century in the state."
67,26,Gretchen,"It's an interesting tension, right, because there's making the law in the language, but if the law itself isn't favourable to the Indigenous people in the area, then it's still a sort of decoration."
67,27,Lauren,"It also underscores the need to continue to support Woi-wurrung-speaking people to continue to develop this language. This is a language going through revitalisation. It hasn't been actively spoken for 50 years. Again, it's not just in language; it has to be about language and supporting language as well. But sometimes these symbolic steps are also really important on that revitalisation journey."
67,28,Gretchen,"There's also a practical benefit to governments mandating that something be in a particular language because it literally sometimes raises the economic value of a language. I was told, 'Stay in French class. If you ever wanna get a job with the government, you need to speak French.' Here, you have some Woi-wurrung translators being hired to make this text, or some writers are hired to compose this text, in this way that also provides languages with certain kinds of economic value."
67,29,Lauren,"Absolutely. We didn't have the same incentive learning languages in Australia. Funnily enough, Australia doesn't even have an official national language, much like the United States of America, and so sometimes you don't even need an official policy when everything is presented in a single language, and you're not given that multilingual option that creates the policy environment instead."
67,30,Gretchen,"You don't necessarily need an official policy because if you actually look at the laws, they're all written in English except for a few that, in more recent years, have had these preambles or these additions in local Indigenous languages. There's an interesting version of that that plays out with Canada's history of bilingualism. The current Governor General of Canada, which is the representative of the Queen in the constitutional monarchy sense. Her name is Mary Simon. She is the first holder of this office to speak an Indigenous language. She's bilingual with Inuktitut and English. She's an Inuk woman herself. But some people have gotten upset in Canada because she's quote-unquote 'not bilingual.'"
67,31,Lauren,She's the wrong kind of bilingual.
67,32,Gretchen,"Mm-hmm. In the official Canadian policy sense where official state-sponsored bilingualism is English and French. She's made great pains to point out that she started learning French since she started holding office and that she respects the French and so on and so forth because this is this political football, but the bilingualisms that get sponsored by a nation state also sometimes make this vacuum where other languages that are spoken in or that are being revitalised in a particular nation don't necessarily get the same level of support."
67,33,Lauren,"I guess this wasn't a problem for Mary Simon before she became the Governor General when she was just a citizen because Canada has a policy as a country of being bilingual on the assumption that private citizens can operate in English or French as suits them, but as soon as she steps into this official role, she's speaking for the country, and the country seems to expect her to speak in the two official languages."
67,34,Gretchen,"Right. There's a lot of levels at which this policy makes sense. If you wanna have someone who's being a judge or who's being an elected representative or being higher levels of civil servant, there's this expectation that speaking both English and French is gonna really help out with that career. It depends on the political party, it depends on the particular type of job, but that's the perception there. Also, there are many people in Canada who speak various languages whether they're Indigenous languages or immigrant languages that aren't part of the official notion of bilingualism. Shouldn't they also have representatives in government? That's the question that having these two particular colonial languages as the official government languages raises."
67,35,Lauren,"Especially because, and we always need to point out, there is nothing inherently better about English or French as languages or any major language that's used by a nation state as their official language."
67,36,Gretchen,"This is one of those things that really gets me about -- it's fun to be excited about language. It's fun to enjoy your own language or enjoy languages that you're learning. But sometimes you get this pernicious view that 'Oh, English took over as a world language because it was so good at adopting words from other languages. We've got this flexible vocabulary.' Like, English became a dominant language not because of verbs and nouns but because of guns and money and other elements of power that were wielded by people who happened to bring their English along with them."
67,37,Lauren,"I think it's always worth remembering who the policy makers get to be and who gets to set the policy agenda. You see it play out time and time again that there are particular types of power that are interestingly scalar. If you look at somewhere like Japan in the Meiji period, there was a reform to standardise Japanese. Funnily enough, the variety they chose to standardise to was Tokyo Japanese, which just happened to be where the Meiji government ruled from."
67,38,Gretchen,"Oh, so surprised."
67,39,Lauren,"There was active reform to standardise Japanese in places like the Ryukyuan islands, like the province of Okinawa, for example. But these languages are so different to standard Japanese that it was a major language shift for people in this area."
67,40,Gretchen,"The analogy that I have seen is that Tokyo Japanese compared to Okinawan, which is a Ryukyuan language, is more different than English to German in terms of comprehensibility. There's really quite a lot of difference there. They're related, but there's quite a lot of difference."
67,41,Lauren,"Over the last few decades there's been this acknowledgement of the uniqueness and the importance of Ryukyuan languages and a return to awareness of their local heritage. What's really interesting is that Okinawan, as the largest of these varieties, has so much more visibility than some of the others. There're at least half a dozen or so Ryukyuan languages, and Okinawan is the one people have usually heard of."
67,42,Gretchen,"Right. So, it goes all the way down. It's fractal. There's one major language in the country, and then even within them are minoritised languages. There's one of those that takes up more of the oxygen. The languages crowding out space from each other goes all the way down."
67,43,Lauren,"And look, I'm sure within Miyako or Amami there's also discussions and debates about how to move forward with language planning and language policy. It's policy choices and power discussions all the way down."
67,44,Gretchen,"This picking the language of the capital that it just so happens people with power speak, this is the same thing with the French of Paris or the English of London. There's lots of levels at which this type of thing happens in different places where it's not an accident that the language or the dialect or the variety that's spoken by the people who already have that kind of power gets picked to be the one that's taught in schools or the one that's used for national level media, or the one that's promoted at the expense of other ones."
67,45,Lauren,"Sometimes, the choice ends up being to pick something that's outside of the traditional power imbalances. You see in both South Africa and India English plays a really central role in national language and in communication because it's avoiding picking something that's more locally politically contentious. In India, that's Hindi. A lot of the other areas don't like the idea that one of the major languages would be the official language of the whole country, and so they've defaulted to English."
67,46,Gretchen,"Or in South Africa, rather than picking between Afrikaans or Zulu or Xhosa or any of their other languages saying, okay, what if we picked a power from the foreign hegemon that's left now, then we will avoid privileging one of these groups over each other. The historic traces of sometimes you pick a non-local, hegemonic power just to avoid choosing between individual local groups can be surprisingly long. When I was joining the European linguistic society, I was interested to see that the official name for it is the Societas Linguistica Europea, which is of course in Latin."
67,47,Lauren,"'Of course,' you say, as though that's obvious that of course it's in Latin."
67,48,Gretchen,"The 'of course' is because, also, if you're in Europe, and you're saying, 'Well, which of these European languages shall we pick between?', one way of saying, 'We don't wanna make this choice,' is say, 'What if we use a language of an antique, local hegemon that is none of our countries' current language?'"
67,49,Lauren,"And was a language of international trade and education for many centuries, which allows you to sidestep resorting to one of the national languages of Europe when a lot of these languages have complex historical legacies. Part of that is because, often, the idea of a nation is imposing an artificial geographic boundary around languages."
67,50,Gretchen,"Is this where we bring up the classic quote, 'Language is a dialect with an army and a navy'?"
67,51,Lauren,Absolutely have to discuss this because the creation of nations really did shape the way people thought about languages and standards and the choice of languages that you use to govern that created nation.
67,52,Gretchen,"Sometimes when linguists are trying to figure out, you know, are these two things that people use in a particular area -- are they languages; are they dialects of each other -- one criterion that's sometimes used is do speakers who speak one understand the other -- do signers who sign one understand the other. This is like our example of Japanese and Okinawan are as difficult to understand mutually from each other a bit harder than between English and German. If you're an English speaker who's encountered German or vice versa, you say, 'Oh, yeah, I don't immediately understand what's going on in that language.' But sometimes this diagnostic criteria can lead us to directions that aren't supported by what people actually do in a practical sense because that's a power relationship. Norwegian and Swedish people can often understand each other, but those languages get called separate languages because they're each associated with a nation state."
67,53,Lauren,"Then on the other side of things, you have a nation state like China where you have these mutually unintelligible varieties that get called 'dialects' of Chinese because China wants to create this sense of unified language policy. Nations have an interesting effect on how people think about the relationship between languages and dialects."
67,54,Gretchen,"Sometimes, something can be called a dialect to make it seem less like it should be taken seriously because 'dialect' gets interpreted as a pejorative. There's a linguist sense in which it's just a word for any variety, but then in practice, when you get told, 'Oh, you're just a dialect,' that seems like a pejorative. There was a campaign a number of years ago in Guatemala about the various local Indigenous languages which generally belong to the Mayan language family. Sometimes, they got all grouped together as just 'Maya' and all dialects of Maya when they have individual names. You have Kaqchikel, and K'iche', Q'anjob'al, and various others. The educational campaign was 'no son dialectos, son idiomas' -- 'They're not dialects, they're languages.' Because they're not mutually intelligible with each other. There are several of them, and they're not just fungible for each other. If you have someone who speaks one, that doesn't mean they can interpret for someone who speaks something else."
67,55,Lauren,Interesting how they're trying to change the discourse around what has been a long-held policy around those languages in Guatemala.
67,56,Gretchen,"I think we have a lot of these projects of multinationalism or colonial empires and things where you're trying to replace or supress particular languages. There are examples of places that have had ongoing, stable community multilingualism or small languages spoken in a variety of areas as well."
67,57,Lauren,"In fact, if we look at human history, stable, small-scale community multilingualism is absolutely the norm. Nation states with their official languages are a weird aberration. For example, in the north of Australia, in the Northern Territory, you had a long-held tradition -- and even the oral history of how these languages came to be was that they were all placed in their own country, and then if you were born into a language, you had ownership of that language. As you grew up and interacted with more communities in the area, you would gain the ability to speak those languages and interact with people in those communities. But it's different how the language that is yours and that you speak compared to a language that you speak because it belongs to someone else. That's a model of language ownership and language use that still is pervasive in Australian Indigenous languages, especially up in the Northern Territory where the languages that are still being passed on to children are mostly spoken today. You see, for example, someone who is a Iwaidjan -- they're an Iwaidja speaker -- and they own that language, but over their lifetime, they might come to speak Mawng or Gun-djeihmi and have social relationships or family relationships into those languages and communities as well."
67,58,Gretchen,"Sometimes, stable, small-community multilingualism is supported by other types of what you can think of as cultural policies. One of these cultural policies is the practice of exogamy, which means that when you marry someone, you need to marry someone who's outside of your social group or outside of your linguistic group. That means that effectively every household potentially has multiple languages going on. And, of course, if you wanna talk to your partner, you end up being functionally bilingual. Your kids end up growing up bilingual because you were also a product of exogamy, so you probably had parents who spoke multiple languages even though one of the ones became the one that you officially identified with for marriage purposes. This idea of having a pluricentric norm where everyone is speaking multiple languages and is being raised in multilingual environments and marrying multilingually is a very different way from how I'm used to approaching how does a group of people decide on which language to speak."
67,59,Lauren,"Yeah, it's a very different social policy environment. Part of the reason Australia's Indigenous language communities have suffered so much is because of some actively bad policies that affected, directly, the speakers of those languages and, therefore, by extension, the languages themselves. You had children removed from families. You had active discouragement of speaking languages. I know very similar things happened in the residential school system in Canada. After so many years of such actively bad language policies, we really haven't picked up the ball in terms of working on sustained, proactively better policies around these communities and their languages."
67,60,Gretchen,"To go back to the Mary Simon example, Canada is still funding, for example, French education in Nunavut to a higher level per capita than it's funding Inuktitut education in Nunavut even though that's actually the language that's of the population in that area. Even just funding Indigenous languages at an equitable level with how it's funding English and French, let alone maybe even funding them at a higher level because of the active language suppression that the Canadian government was doing for so many years, you'd think they could maybe try to do the inverse, but we're not even at that level of parity yet."
67,61,Lauren,It'd be really great to see more countries proactively using language policy to address some of the bad choices that have been made.
67,62,Gretchen,"In some ways, Quebec gets cited as an example within Canada in other language revitalisation contexts of various sorts of legal policies whether that's signage policies that have to include French or education policies where kids have to go to school in French as an example of successfully making a language increasingly important or validating a language that people were using but didn't have the state-level validation. It's one of those things where, okay, this can be a model, but where else are we doing this and where else do we need to be doing this. I've been thinking about this question of language policy and how the personal interacts with the policy level a lot recently because I've been reading this new book by Julie Sedivy, who's a linguist, called Memory Speaks."
67,63,Lauren,Excellent.
67,64,Gretchen,I am familiar with Julie from linguist Twitter. I was really delighted to find that her book is very good. It's a combination of memoir and science book.
67,65,Lauren,What a fabulous genre combination.
67,66,Gretchen,I know! It interweaves things about her life and other people who've had heritage language or bilingualism experiences then also with things about what the psycholinguistics literature -- she's trained as a psycholinguist -- what it says about language learning and language reclamation. There's this combination of anecdotes and studies that makes it fairly readable.
67,67,Lauren,Fabulous. What were some highlights for you?
67,68,Gretchen,"The basic premise of the book is that Julie Sedivy and her family immigrated from what was then Czechoslovakia to Canada when Julie was 4 years old. Obviously, her parents were the ones doing this immigration, but you know, they brought along their 4-year-old, as you would expect. She didn't go back there until adulthood. She was speaking Czech as a kid, and then she gradually switched to English through school. English became dominant. Then she has this voyage of reclaiming Czech in adulthood when she goes back there and interacts with some of her extended family again."
67,69,Lauren,"This story of moving from speaking a heritage language as a migrant through to feeling that implication of policy and that pressure to move to the language of the country that you are living in is such a common story where the focus is on not necessarily retaining that multilingual experience but, especially for kids, trying to fit in to the education system is such a big pressure for them."
67,70,Gretchen,"Exactly. I think that's one of the things that Sedivy does a really good job of in the book because she's talking about her own personal experience, but then she's also interweaving other people's stories from memoirs and from talking to people. People write in to her now that she's writing about it a bit and talking about that and talking about it both as an immigrant experience because this is so common as a part of immigration and also as an Indigenous experience where there's similar pressures from language shift but without that comforting buttress of the home country where she could always go back and find 10 million Czech speakers even if currently the trip across was closed to her in the 90s when there was political turmoil going on. You don't have that backstop of comfort if you're worried about losing your heritage language and all of the speakers of that language are still in Canada and there aren't very many of them."
67,71,Lauren,"Her story sounds slightly unusual, though, in that she gave herself the chance to reconnect with a heritage language, which not everyone gets the opportunity to do."
67,72,Gretchen,"She has this anecdote that sticks out to me that she goes back and she's in Prague in the train station, and she overhears this announcement on the loudspeaker in Czech, you know, 'This is when the next train's arriving.' She says, 'I felt as if one of my brothers or uncles had, as a prank, grabbed the microphone and started speaking in our own family code. I expected the announcement to be pulled away at any moment by someone with real authority. Of course, in my mind, I was well aware that train announcements in Prague would be made in Czech. But standing on that railway platform, what I felt in the goose bumps that prickled my skin was, 'My god, there's a whole nation full of people who speak this language.''"
67,73,Lauren,"It really shows the power of seeing your language used in a public space and policy that encourages a particular language in public is very different to private, household usage."
67,74,Gretchen,Exactly. It's sort of the public/private dichotomy again of this language is on the milk cartons or this language is being spoken in the train station.
67,75,Lauren,There must've been a real sense of nostalgia involved in returning to Czechia and engaging with her family's heritage.
67,76,Gretchen,"She also has a really great anecdote about that. She links it to this notion of having the childhood food that tastes like nostalgia to you and that comes with all of the emotional baggage around this food that your parents used to make or that you used to eat for a treat as a kid or that you really enjoyed there. Someone else having that favourite childhood food when you're grown up, and you're like, waxing rhapsodic about 'Oh, yeah, it's so great,' and somebody else tastes it, and they're like, 'Yeah, I mean, this is fine. It's delicious,' but they don't have all of those emotional sense memories that come back when they're eating that food that you have years and decades of associations with."
67,77,Lauren,"It reminds me of the experience of feeding people who didn't grow up with Commonwealth country Christmases Christmas pudding, and they're like, 'This is not as good as the stories made it sound.'"
67,78,Gretchen,"I think when I tried Turkish delight, I was expecting it to be much more exciting than the Chronicles of Narnia made it sound, like it was gonna be really exciting. And then I was like, 'Oh, well, okay.' I clearly don't have whatever memories C. S. Lewis has of this food. I think that having this association of like, this was the language that, as she said, somebody stroked your hair while singing a lullaby to you, or this is the language that someone scolded you in, or this is the language that is associated with these very bright and visceral memories of childhood compared to a language that you learned a little bit older and is maybe more intellectual or less immediate or is associated with a different emotional tenor. She goes into some of the research on what happens with different types of people going to therapy in their first language versus their second language. How does that experience change? It's a really interesting combination of the personal and the broader-scale studies."
67,79,Lauren,Being able to access therapy or medical services in a language you feel most comfortable in highlights just how much personal effect policy can have on your life and your experiences.
67,80,Gretchen,"Right. Language is very personal, but it isn't only personal because it's existing in society that supports it or denies it or something like that. Anyway, everyone should read Memory Speaks. I think it's very interesting, and I learned a lot of things."
67,81,Lauren,"People's connection to their language is seen again and again in the way that people fight for particular policies. So, the way that Canada made sure as it became a nation that it was supporting both the French-speaking populations and the English-speaking populations that were there by the time it became a country."
67,82,Gretchen,"And explicitly not the Indigenous populations, but yep, that was what was going on at the time."
67,83,Lauren,"There're many other stories as well. When India was partitioned into India and what was then Pakistan, both West Pakistan -- today's Pakistan -- and East Pakistan, which is today's Bangladesh, a lot of that division was done on some language grounds. But the East Pakistan area had the language of Urdu imposed on it, which was not a language of that area. After that happened, the Bangla-speaking population protested that Urdu would be the one and only official language of this new state of Pakistan. There were a series of sustained protests in 1947 that carried through for many years. It's led to a major protest in 1952 that was led by students at the University of Dakar. During that protest, that was all around the need to recognise Bangla as a language of Pakistan, the police opened fire and killed five and injured hundreds of the protesters that were there. Eventually, after this event and after much more public agitation, Bangla was recognised as a language of Pakistan and became the language of the country of Bangladesh when it became its own country. Mother Language Day is actually recognised as a public holiday in Bangladesh because of this event."
67,84,Gretchen,"On the 50th anniversary of this, it became International Mother Language Day, which is recognised by the United Nations on February 21st every year as a way of celebrating and bringing awareness towards linguistic and cultural diversity. They have a theme every year, and a lot of organisations -- museums and so on -- use it as an excuse to show movies of people advocating for their own languages or other types of programming -- bringing in speakers -- and provide a focal point for programming that's related to the notions of mother languages, and particularly in this context, mother languages that are otherwise minoritised or not necessarily given as much attention to."
67,85,Lauren,"And those that are actively oppressed. One thing I find really interesting about International Mother Language Day -- because it's run by the UN -- the UN sits outside of the usual national level discussion. And so, language advocates from different countries can come together and get around the national level policy and limitations of discussion and connect with advocates from other parts of the world."
67,86,Gretchen,"I think that's one of the things about language policy in general is that there's often simultaneously this very personal aspect of a language that was taken from somebody or a language that was not passed down in a particular family that is both very personal but also something that has happened a lot in a lot of different circumstances around the world. Sometimes, bringing language communities and language advocates together to learn from each other and talk to each other and get this sense of swapping tips for ways to bring that language back into more common use or ways to encourage each other in language advocacy is the kind of thing that a big international organisation like the UN can do."
67,87,Lauren,"In recognition of the fact that so many Indigenous languages have suffered from power imbalances and policies that have directly and negatively affected them, the UN has declared this decade the Decade of Indigenous Languages -- from this year, 2022, all the way through to 2032."
67,88,Gretchen,"Hopefully, that will provide a good focal point for discussions around various things that people are doing to support Indigenous languages. We'll see how that plays out between 2022 and 2032."
67,89,Lauren,"It can be really easy to stick 'hello' in a bunch of different languages on the wall. You might even get the writing systems going in the right direction. But policy involves hard and sustained work. When you see the positive effect it has on people and society, I feel like it's definitely worth thinking about how we can do that hard work."
67,90,Gretchen,I think the things that let people bring their full self into society at large rather than holding it away from the public sphere because they feel like parts of them aren't welcome is this big thing that's a huge benefit.
67,91,Lauren,"This was really one of those episodes where we had so many stories we could tell. Everyone is affected by language policy. Language policies in different parts of the world play out in, sometimes, really different and, sometimes, alarmingly similar ways."
67,92,Gretchen,"If you have another language policy story that you wanna share with us or with your fellow lingthusiasts, do let us know. Tag us in it on social media or let us know on the Lingthusiasm Discord. Because it's one of those topics that someone could run a whole podcast that is entirely about language policy. [Music]"

68,7,Lauren,"Gretchen, I have a list of words for you. It's your job to figure out what they all have in common."
68,8,Gretchen,"Okay, great."
68,9,Lauren,'Chai.'
68,10,Gretchen,Okay.
68,11,Lauren,'Croissant.'
68,12,Gretchen,Okay.
68,13,Lauren,'Tea.'
68,14,Gretchen,This is a great list.
68,15,Lauren,"'Pho,' 'beef,' 'gymnasium,' 'Pendle Hill.'"
68,16,Gretchen,"[Laughs] Okay. At first, I was thinking this is a very delicious list. You have 'chai,' 'croissant,' you know, I'm having a nice tea party. 'Pho,' 'beef' -- you know, maybe not tea party food but delicious food. And then you said 'gymnasium' and 'Pendle Hill.'"
68,17,Lauren,A place in the UK.
68,18,Gretchen,"Which is a place in the UK, okay, great. It's not the name for some sort of biscuit that I don't know about."
68,19,Lauren,Not that I'm aware of.
68,20,Gretchen,"Clearly, we're not just dealing with the meanings of these words because I -- I mean, I guess they're all nouns, but that's kind of boring. I think I'm gonna say what they all have in common is that they're all words that have gotten borrowed into English at some point."
68,21,Lauren,That is correct.
68,22,Gretchen,Yay!
68,23,Lauren,"Borrowing words from other languages, and in this list, they come from a whole range of different languages. It's something any language can do. English has a reputation for being very good at borrowing words from other languages, but it is a really common strategy for when you have to refer to something that you don't quite have a word for yet."
68,24,Gretchen,"It's hard to even imagine English without loanwords. I mean, English without 'tea' or something like this. Because some of the loanwords in English are incredibly old, and we've even forgotten that they're loanwords, and some of them are very new and recent and in the process of being borrowed."
68,25,Lauren,"It's not really borrowing even though that is the term that gets used for it because once we took 'tea' as a word and as a beverage, we didn't ever give it back to the languages that these words were originally from."
68,26,Gretchen,"Right. But also, that didn't mean that the languages the words were originally from had to stop using them in the way that if I borrow a book from you, you can't read that book until I give it back. I guess you could think of it as more like the internet style copy-pasting."
68,27,Lauren,Okay.
68,28,Gretchen,"You know, like if I copy-paste a word, the word still exists on your website even though I copy-pasted it and put it in mine. Or you screen cap the word."
68,29,Lauren,"I like the screen capping idea of borrowing words as internet memes that get circulated because the more you copy something and screenshot it and play around with it, there's all this glitchy-ness that happens in an image, and there's all these small distortions that happen in a word when you borrow it as well."
68,30,Gretchen,It gets pixelated and water-marked around the edges. I feel like that's something that happens to words when they get passed around.
68,31,Lauren,"I mean, one of the things that's really immediately obvious is that a word often shifts its pronunciation a bit to fit into the way that the language that it arrives in is spoken."
68,32,Gretchen,Absolutely. I see this a lot with -- there's so many words in English that have arrived from French both in ancient history periods and all the way up through the modern day. There's so many different ways that they get pronounced depending on whether English speakers perceive them as still actively a French word or not.
68,33,Lauren,"And there are some words where there's variation between speakers. I say, 'croissant' with the final T, but I don't think you have that when you say that word."
68,34,Gretchen,"No, I would say /kɹʌsɑ̃:/. I don't think of there being a T there, even though, like, I'm not pronouncing it like it's fully French. I'm not using the French R, /kʁʌsɑ̃:/, which I would do if I was in a bakery in Montreal. But I just don't think of the T as being pronounced there at all. I noticed when you were reading the list of words that you pronounced the name of the Vietnamese noodle soup dish as /fʌ/, which is also how I would say it now. But when I first encountered this word, I pronounced it /foʊ/ because I didn't know anything about the pronunciation of Vietnamese."
68,35,Lauren,I remember when I learnt that the Vietnamese vowel that's used for 'pho' is slightly different and definitely not what you would read if you were reading that directly as an English word. I love getting to update my knowledge of how to pronounce words. I got to learn something about Vietnamese that I didn't know at that time.
68,36,Gretchen,I expect neither of us are still pronouncing that word exactly how it's said in Vietnamese because we're still just doing an English approximation of it.
68,37,Lauren,"Vietnamese is a language with tones, and I definitely don't know what tone that would be. It's a mid-point in pronunciation that's closer to the original Vietnamese word. Part of that is that there is some of the orthography in Vietnamese that's not normally carried over into English. Part of the glitchy-ness of copy-pasting a word over from one language to another is that sometimes it needs to be copied into a new orthography as well as a new writing system. That can change things up as well."
68,38,Gretchen,"Right. There're some things that are easier to copy over. If not pronouncing a T is free -- everyone knows how to not pronounce a T -- but producing that French R or the nasal vowel in 'croissant,' like producing the tone in Vietnamese, is something that is not present in English. Depending on what other languages you've been exposed to, certain types of pronunciation things can come with it or not come with it."
68,39,Lauren,"Of course, there're always complications and exceptions. Japanese has a writing system that deals specifically with words of foreign origin -- the katakana syllabary. There are some words that have been borrowed for so long that they have their own kanji. They're more fully included in the writing system that Japanese has for its own vocabulary. A word like 'tobacco,' which was brought into Japan along with the leafy product in the 16th century, has its own kanji, which means that it is much less immediately recognisable as a loanword than something that is much more modern."
68,40,Gretchen,"Ah, 'tobacco,' that sounds like it already fits the sounds of Japanese and the syllable structure of Japanese, so it wouldn't seem as obviously foreign as a word that was pronounced very differently. I think one of the classic examples with how writing systems sometimes influence how words get borrowed is -- so in Chinese there's a whole bunch of Chinese characters that have both a sound part and a meaning part to their shape. There's a small set of about 200 that are used to convey spellings of words that are borrowed in from other languages. But their meaning is still transparent if you're a Chinese speaker. You still recognise what that meaning is. You just also realise from context that it's being used to represent a foreign word. When Coca-Cola was first becoming available in Chinese, Coca-Cola the company hadn't yet made an official transliteration available to shopkeepers. So, various shopkeepers came up with their own ad hoc transliterations using these 200 characters that are used for foreign words."
68,41,Lauren,I'm a little bit alarmed by 'various' and 'ad hoc' in that sentence there.
68,42,Gretchen,As well you should be because some of these versions that people came up with -- so the word 'la' -- I'm sure I'm doing the tone wrong -- corresponds to the character for 'wax.' A lot of them have to do with wax to make sounds like 'ko-ka-ko-la' such as 'female horse fastened with wax.'
68,43,Lauren,Delicious.
68,44,Gretchen,'Wax-flattened mare' or 'Bite the wax tadpole.'
68,45,Lauren,Right. I can see why you probably don't wanna leave the transcription of your loanword in the hands of an ad hoc committee of shopkeepers.
68,46,Gretchen,"So, Coca-Cola the company did end up coming up with their own transliteration actually using 'ko-ka-ko-le' because they couldn't find a good 'la' word that had a meaning that they wanted to associate with their product."
68,47,Lauren,What did that come out as.
68,48,Gretchen,That came out 'ko-ku-ko-le' meaning 'to allow the mouth to be able to rejoice.'
68,49,Lauren,"Oh, definitely more satisfying from a marketing perspective than 'wax-flattened mare.'"
68,50,Gretchen,"Yeah, exactly. There's ways that you deal with pronunciation and approximating pronunciation and also giving people the ability to write or transfer formats from one thing to another."
68,51,Lauren,"I guess we can think of finger spelling in signed languages as a kind of loanword technique. Well, the signed languages I'm familiar with, including Auslan and ASL, there is a sign that represents each of the 26 letters of the English alphabet. If you need to tell someone, say, a person's name, and they don't have a sign for their name in the language, you can spell out their name, or you can spell out a technical term, if you just need to refer quickly to that. The rate at which people finger spell is phenomenal whether it's the one-handed ASL system or the two-handed BSL/Auslan system. But sometimes the finger spelling becomes the name of the word. There're a few examples -- I know the Auslan for 'ham' is literally just the letters H-A-M, so kind of a loanword there."
68,52,Gretchen,"I sometimes see this when I'm looking at interpreters at conferences, and the speaker will say some sort of technical term, and then I'll see the interpreter a couple of seconds later clearly spelling out something. And then sometimes, they'll be in a bit of dialogue with the d/Deaf person sitting in the front row, and then the d/Deaf person will tell them, 'Oh, you mean this term,' and then they'll start using something that's the actual sign for the technical term if they don't know what that is in ASL or a different sign language."
68,53,Lauren,"Yeah, I think it turns up a lot in interpreting because you're often moving between a word in English and either agreeing upon a sign or planning some kind of commonality there, but it's not a strategy that has to be used in the language. Most words have their own sign, so it is kind of cute and funny when a word like 'ham' pops up."
68,54,Gretchen,It's sort of a way of bridging between these two modalities. One of my favourite examples of something that happens when a word gets brought over from one language to another is that sometimes the meaning can shift a bit while that's happening.
68,55,Lauren,Another little glitch in the copy-paste.
68,56,Gretchen,"Exactly. I encounter this a lot in French because I encounter French so much. Recently, I encountered the word /seɑ̃s/ which in English would be 'séance.'"
68,57,Lauren,"'Séance' as, like, a thing where you try and speak to the dead."
68,58,Gretchen,"Yeah. But in French, 'séance' can also just be used as a less formal version of a session."
68,59,Lauren,Okay. That means it must pop up in a far broader range of contexts than speaking to the dead.
68,60,Gretchen,"Right. You can have something like a 'therapy séance' or a 'workout séance,' and that just means a session."
68,61,Lauren,And nothing paranormal? Just to be really clear.
68,62,Gretchen,No paranormal people at the gym or not with your paranormal therapist.
68,63,Lauren,"So, we've borrowed it into English with a really narrow meaning, but it has this much broader meaning in French."
68,64,Gretchen,"Exactly. The same thing goes amazingly with the word 'baguette' which, again, I imagine most people are probably familiar with as the long bread."
68,65,Lauren,Long loaf of bread.
68,66,Gretchen,"But 'baguette' is actually a French word for a long, thin object."
68,67,Lauren,"Oh, so this explains why long-cut gems and diamonds and emeralds are called 'baguette cut.'"
68,68,Gretchen,"Ah, I guess it does."
68,69,Lauren,"I always thought that they were named after the loaf of bread, but it is, in fact, that it's a more general term in French. This makes so much more sense now."
68,70,Gretchen,"And also, this explains why -- a friend of mine who was doing a French exam where you had a reading passage, reading comprehension, and they had in this passage 'baguette magique,' which is not a magic baguette."
68,71,Lauren,I feel disappointed already.
68,72,Gretchen,"But in fact, a magic wand."
68,73,Lauren,"Ah, that makes a lot of sense. That is less whimsical."
68,74,Gretchen,"Also, 'baguettes chinoises.' These are chopsticks."
68,75,Lauren,"Ah, the long, Chinese things."
68,76,Gretchen,"Yeah, which coincidentally have to do with food but are not involved with using a piece of bread to scoop up some food. It involves using chopsticks."
68,77,Lauren,"A much, much broader sense of the word 'baguette' in the original language borrowed for a specific thing into English."
68,78,Gretchen,"Right, exactly. You can understand why this French kind of long bread is a very salient use of 'baguette' but is not the only kind. It gets us into what comes up a lot in language classes, the notion of 'false friends' of words that seem like they should directly translate from language to another but actually have different and sometimes embarrassingly different meanings."
68,79,Lauren,Let's go with a couple of our favourites just because they are so good.
68,80,Gretchen,"There're so many. Speaking of embarrassing, English 'embarrassed' and Spanish 'embarazada,' which you might think might mean 'embarrassed' but in fact means 'pregnant.'"
68,81,Lauren,"Oh, yes, very different. 'She is embarrassed.' One of my favourites is from our list at the top of the show. English 'gymnasium' as a place where you do physical activity and work out is not to be confused with German 'gymnasium,' which is a school. But even though they have different meanings, they do share a history because a Greek gymnasium was where you'd learn and work out all together in an integrated system. German took one part of that meaning, and English took the other part. You wanna be really sure whether you're walking into a place of learning or working out."
68,82,Gretchen,"I think the equipment that you'd bring with you would be very different depending on which one you're aiming to do. The one that always gets me -- and this is a very Canadian experience of learning vocabulary from packaging -- is that you can get toothpaste that's labelled 'pour les dents sensible,' which is for what looks like sensible teeth."
68,83,Lauren,Your sensible toothpaste.
68,84,Gretchen,"But in fact, it is for sensitive teeth because 'sensible' and /sɑ̃sibl/ have different meanings even though they look the same."
68,85,Lauren,All of these examples are really great reminders that you can't just eyeball a loanword and take it for granted because it's not always quite that simple.
68,86,Gretchen,"Sometimes, you get a word that looks like a loanword, it looks like it comes from another language, but it doesn't actually exist in the other language with that meaning or, sometimes, with any meaning at all. There's this great French word 'le babyfoot.'"
68,87,Lauren,"As in, like, the foot of an infant?"
68,88,Gretchen,"Yes, but it's all one word, 'babyfoot.'"
68,89,Lauren,Okay. What does it mean? Because it sounds adorable.
68,90,Gretchen,"It refers to the game that's found in pubs sometimes where you have a football game that you can play on a table where you twiddle the little knobs, which in English is known as 'foosball,' but that's actually borrowed from German 'Fußball,' which refers to just football in general."
68,91,Lauren,"Ah, we just call it 'German football.' Wow. That is definitely a borrowing that had a shift."
68,92,Gretchen,"It's this double shift where the French one is supposed to be English, but the English one is trying to be German, and the German word for this game is 'Kicker,' which also looks like it's trying to be English."
68,93,Lauren,Amazing.
68,94,Gretchen,"So, everyone's like, yeah, it's a great game. It has something to do with foot, but it's not a word in our language."
68,95,Lauren,"Because the linguist in me always is picking up on what people are saying, I found it really interesting that especially when you put the 'le' in front of it, your pronunciation of 'babyfoot' changed a little bit from how you say it in English. You had kind of moved it into a slightly more French pronunciation."
68,96,Gretchen,"I think it's something that I think about a lot when it comes to borrowing a word or using a loanword -- how much are you using the target language's pronunciation? If I'm borrowing something into English, do I pronounce it in an English way? Or how much are you using the source language's pronunciation? And how this varies depending on your level of knowledge of both of those languages and also who you're talking to and how much of those languages they know and even what you're trying to prove. Is this something you've experienced?"
68,97,Lauren,"Yeah, I think about this a lot when I'm moving between Australia and Nepal and when I choose to use particular words and how I pronounce them. A word like 'chia,' which is the Nepali word for 'tea' and, particularly, the very sweet, strong tea that is brewed in Nepal, when I'm speaking to a Nepali in Nepal in the language, I will say 'chia,' but if I'm speaking to Australians there, I might say, 'Do you want chai?' because that's the word they're more familiar with for that drink."
68,98,Gretchen,"And if you go back to Australia, and you're in a coffee shop, and you're like, 'Oh, can I get a chai latte,' or something."
68,99,Lauren,I would never try and order 'chia' unless I'm with people who are gonna make it properly.
68,100,Gretchen,"There's this much parodied tendency for North Americans to go on a trip to Barcelona and come back saying /barθelona/ or something like that and have learnt zero other words of Spanish or Catalan at the time, but now they're correcting everyone's pronunciation of the city, and you're like, 'I don't know.'"
68,101,Lauren,"We have an exemplary sketch of this that we'll link to in the shownotes where one of the characters in the sketch continuously, from all of the languages that they are borrowing words from, will use a very over-the-top pronunciation."
68,102,Gretchen,"It's interesting because there are absolutely contexts in which pronouncing a word the way people are saying it around you is the polite thing to do, and there're also contexts in which pronouncing a word the way it's pronounced in the origin language, especially when it's been something that's borrowed in English for a long time, is over-the-top and seems like you're over-exoticising a word or pretentiously talking down to somebody else because they are saying 'bruschetta' or something like that. It's this interesting balance, and I don't think there's just one answer."
68,103,Lauren,"I think there are certainly factors that you can take into account when you're making a decision about how to pronounce a word and that we all do take into account subconsciously -- what language are you speaking in, and who are you speaking to, and where are you, are all great things to keep in mind when you're making a choice about the pronunciation of a word like 'croissant.' And for me, even thought I'm not a very good French speaker, I will try and say it more francophone if I'm in a French-speaking country."
68,104,Gretchen,"I think being sensitive to some of the power dynamics around that and there isn't just one answer for all of these circumstances. Sometimes, these power dynamics, like how you pick which pronunciation to use in which circumstances, also show up in terms of which words get borrowed in the first place. I think the classic example in English is how we have a word for 'cow' which refers to the animal and 'beef' which refers to the meat of that animal. The same thing with 'pig' and 'pork' or 'sheep' and 'mutton,' although not as many people talk about mutton these days, or maybe 'chicken' and 'poultry.' We have certain types of doublets of this in English. 'Cow' and 'pig' and 'sheep' all come from Old English where 'beef' and 'pork' and 'mutton' come from Norman French because of this idea that the English-speaking peasants were out in the fields farming with the cows and the pigs, and the Norman overlords were sitting there with their nicely sliced meat that was already prepared for them. So, the French word came to be used for the prepared or the dead thing, whereas in French you can have a 'mouton' or 'bœuf' or something that refers to both the animal and the meat, the same way we do for chicken."
68,105,Lauren,"We also see this play out in terms of which languages we borrow scientific or technical vocabulary from. A lot of the vocabulary that we have in English for these fields comes from Latin, and it comes from Greek. In fact, when we were preparing this show, Gretchen, you told me that 'tungsten' is actually a Swedish word. And I got completely surprised because I just assumed that it, like many of the other words for elements, had a Latin or a Greek origin."
68,106,Gretchen,"Yeah, I came across this tweet saying that 'tungsten' is literally from 'heavy stone' in Swedish, which you can kind of see that '-sten' meaning 'stone' part, but the element is actually called 'wolfram,' or probably /volfram/, in Swedish."
68,107,Lauren,"Oh, so we didn't even borrow their name for the element from them; we borrowed the word 'heavy stone.'"
68,108,Gretchen,"It just shifted again. This is something that I came across a lot when I was learning about constellations because a lot of constellation names that we use for groups of stars still come from Greek mythology even though many cultures have had names for groups of stars in their ontologies. But the ones in the scientific community has inherited have been largely from Greek. The names of specific stars largely come from Arabic. I feel like this reflects maybe some differences in priorities about are you gonna name the specific stars or are you gonna name the groups of stars that these two cultures that came in contact with each other. Now, scientists have this hybrid system where it's some parts Greek, some parts Arabic."
68,109,Lauren,"One of the things I always find interesting about these loanwords that come to us in batches from particular domains is how it highlights global history, and usually global histories of trade and different power dynamics that have operated over that history. One of my absolute favourite stories is the story of tea. We've already talked about 'chai' and 'chia' in Nepali, 'tea' in English. The words for 'tea' in many of the world's languages appear to be related. They'll either have some kind of /te/ or /ti/ pronunciation or some kind of /t͡ʃ/ -- 'chia,' 'chai' pronunciation. That's because there were two main places in China from which tea travelled to all the different markets in the world."
68,110,Gretchen,"In Mandarin, which is historically more spoken towards the centre of China, the word for tea is 'cha,' but in Min Nan, which is also a variety of Chinese as spoken in the coastal province of Fujian, it's pronounced /te/. They use the same character, but they're pronounced differently, which is very common for how Chinese gets written. The key thing here is 'coastal' because people who encountered the plant and the drink tea via the sea, via Fujianese traders, learned to pronounce it /te/ or variants on /te/. In French and German, it's /te/. In English, it used to be /te/ until the vowel shifted. Whereas people who encountered tea through Central China, through land routes like the silk road -- so through Sinitic 'cha' -- you get Mandarin 'cha,' Korean 'cha,' Japanese 'ocha,' but also Hindi 'chai,' Persian 'chai,' Arabic 'shai,' Turkish 'chai,' Russian 'chai,' and you're down to Swahili 'chai,' all goes through that land route, and sometimes via Persia, to get from 'cha' to 'chai.' The great maps that people have produced where you can tell if people encountered tea through the land route where they get 'cha,' which becomes 'chai,' or through the sea route, which becomes 'te' and variants on 'te' like 'tea.'"
68,111,Lauren,"Then there are a small number of languages like Polish where the word for tea is 'herbata,' which is a borrowing from the Latinate word that we have in our language as 'herb.'"
68,112,Gretchen,"In places where tea leaves were already indigenous, and they weren't encountering them via trade, like in Burmese, for example, tea leaves are 'lakphak' -- I hope I'm saying that right -- because they didn't need to use a trade word for something they already had."
68,113,Lauren,One of the other global stories I love is the transfusion of the technology and the terminology for books out from Arabic into a large sphere of the world.
68,114,Gretchen,"'Kitab' is the Arabic word for book, but words that are related to 'kitab' show up in a whole bunch of languages around the world -- Persian, Hindi, I think Nepali, right?"
68,115,Lauren,Mm-hmm.
68,116,Gretchen,"Azerbaijani, Kazakh. So, in that area of Asia. But also, Swahili. In Kinyarwanda, the word is 'igitabo,' which sounds like 'kitab,' but you've put more vowels in it. Then the plural is 'ibitabo' because the 'gi-' becomes B, basically, to make it plural, which is a systematic thing that happens in a whole bunch of words. They were like, 'Ah, a singular that begins with 'ki-', we know what to do with this,' and sort of adapted that to the local way of forming words as well. It's this great example of how you borrow when you need to fill a gap in your vocabulary. A lot of languages have borrowed the English word for 'computer' because 'computer' spread through English. And then whenever I see 'kitab' show up in another language that I'm encountering, I'm like, 'Ah, yes, I know where you got that one.'"
68,117,Lauren,"That was a really nice example of how, when a word gets borrowed, often it will be regularised into the language. 'Kitab,' the plural in Arabic is 'kutub,' but in Kinyarwanda, it's regularised into the plural system there. In languages like Nepali, it's 'kitab' in the singular and 'kitabharu' in the plural. They've used their standard plural form there as well. So, part of the borrowing it in and making it part of your own vocabulary is making it part of the grammatical system."
68,118,Gretchen,"Sometimes, this happens through reanalysing part of the word to do something else. Sometimes, you could just add another thing like '-haru' to make it plural. I almost feel like English is missing out because we didn't get to be part of the 'kitab' party. But if we borrowed it, we'd probably turn it into 'kitabs' because that's how we make plurals. When English borrowed the word for 'cherry' from French, we borrowed it as /t͡ʃeriz/, which is modern French /seriz/. Then people reinterpreted that S as if it was already plural and back formed the word 'cherry' as the singular of that."
68,119,Lauren,"Okay. So, the French /t͡ʃeriz/, that's actually the singular. That just means 'one.'"
68,120,Gretchen,Yeah.
68,121,Lauren,'One /t͡ʃeriz/.'
68,122,Gretchen,Yeah.
68,123,Lauren,"Okay! Huh, there we go. As an English speaker, my brain just hears that /s/ and thinks we're talking more than one."
68,124,Gretchen,"Exactly. The more deeply intertwined a language's borrowing can happen with the stuff that's already going on in the language I think the more fun it is. One of my favourite examples of this is the word for 'download,' which like a lot of computer vocabulary has been borrowed from English into a lot of languages. The word for 'download' in German is 'download,' but if you make it past, you can get things like 'downgeloadet,' because 'I have downloaded,' the way you can form that is by putting the 'ge-' and the '-et' at the end."
68,125,Lauren,"So, it behaves exactly like a regular German verb would in that context."
68,126,Gretchen,"Right. But it's separating out the 'down' and the 'load' because German is close enough to English that they're like, 'Oh, yeah, we can recognise that these are two parts, and we're gonna put the 'ge-' in the middle,' which you wouldn't do if it was something that you were borrowing and you didn't have any context for. It's an interesting reanalysis."
68,127,Lauren,"English has borrowed so many words from languages like Latin and Greek, usually via French, that we now have just borrowed the affixes that they use. So, '-ation' in English, like 'motivation' and 'meditation,' they were Latin words with their Latin affixes. But now I can use a suffix like '-ation' or '-ise' is another one from Greek. I could say, 'I can chai-ise my cake.'"
68,128,Gretchen,"Putting chai in it, yeah."
68,129,Lauren,"Not the most elegant example of that, but it's now become something useful in English because we borrowed so many words with these affixes."
68,130,Gretchen,"The other thing that I find really fun when, again, watching languages intertwine via borrowing is when the concept behind the word gets borrowed but not the actual word itself. They translate it sort of piece by piece. I first encountered this when I was learning German in high school. I learned the German word 'Fernseher,' which means 'television,' but it literally translates as 'far seer.' 'Fernseher' is 'far seer.'"
68,131,Lauren,Hang on. Wait a minute. That's also what 'television' means.
68,132,Gretchen,"It sure is. 'Tele-' is Greek for 'distance' and 'vision,' of course, is seeing. So, somebody went and said, 'Oh, what's the name for this technology? Ah, they're using these Greek and Latin roots. What if we use Germanic roots for this concept?'"
68,133,Lauren,And you get the 'far seer.' Another really great example of this is English 'skyscraper' because those two parts 'sky' and 'scraper' get literally translated across a range of languages.
68,134,Gretchen,"Yeah. Because in French it's 'grateciel,' which is literally, like, 'scrapes sky.'"
68,135,Lauren,"Italian is 'grattacielo' and German is 'Wolkenkratzer.' They all literally mean, 'scraped sky.'"
68,136,Gretchen,"There's a whole bunch of examples from various languages that have been like, 'What a great mental image! But actually, we're gonna translate each of these words individually.' There're also, sometimes, people do experiments with trying to undo loanwords. There's a paper called, 'Uncleftish Beholding,' which was written in English trying to explain atomic theory in only words with English etymologies."
68,137,Lauren,"Okay, so, ignoring the last thousand years of contact that English has had with an incredible variety of other languages."
68,138,Gretchen,"Exactly. 'Uncleftish' -- like, an atom is literally something that's 'not split' in its Greek roots. So, if you have 'un-cleft,' that is literally translating piece-by-piece this idea of 'a-tomic,' 'un-cleftish.' Then you can keep going. Translating 'waterstuff' for 'hydrogen' because 'hydro-' just means 'water.'"
68,139,Lauren,"Amazing, but I imagine quite a bit of mental gymnastics to read."
68,140,Gretchen,"It's definitely an interesting thought experiment to read, but it hasn't caught on."
68,141,Lauren,"The technical term for this translation, instead of just borrowing the word but translating it literally into the other language, is called 'calquing,' which I find very satisfying because 'calque' is a loanword from French, but 'loanword' is a calque of the German word that we got the concept from in the first place."
68,142,Gretchen,"It's like 'calque' is a loanword but 'loanword' is a calque. You could've really just done this the other way around, and it would've been pleasantly symmetrical. But also, no."
68,143,Lauren,"It would've been wonderfully self-defining, but here we are."
68,144,Gretchen,"I also find it really interesting when languages borrow other grammatical features from each other. They may be a little bit more abstract than an individual word. There's a really interesting paper by the linguist Marianne Mithun, who wrote a paper about this question of why there are certain areas of the world that tend to have certain grammatical types of features even when the languages that have a particular grammatical feature aren't necessarily historically related to each other, as in coming from a common ancestor."
68,145,Lauren,"Okay. So, if they're not all getting from a common ancestor, what is happening?"
68,146,Gretchen,"Right, exactly. If you take something like evidentiality -- one of your favourite features --"
68,147,Lauren,Indeed.
68,148,Gretchen,"-- where you indicate the source of the information that you got something whether you experienced it with your own senses, whether you heard it from someone else. This is the kind of feature that I know when linguists learn about it -- like when I learned about it in grad school, I spent a couple of weeks being like, now I need to pay attention to all of the sources for all the information that I had while I was speaking English even though we don't have this as a grammatical type of thing. Marianne Mithun's paper points out that if you have a whole region where a whole bunch of languages have evidentiality, even though historically evidentiality only comes from one family that's not necessarily related to all of them, it might be because a lot of people have been bilingual and multilingual in this area for a long period of time. Because when one of your languages has evidentiality or something else, it might make you wanna use those optional ways of marking evidence in the other languages you speak as well."
68,149,Lauren,"This definitely fits with what I've noticed in Yolmo. There is an evidential category for something being a generally known fact. I get a lot of examples like, 'Lemons are sour,' 'Sugar is sweet,' and this doesn't exist in any of the other Tibetan languages. But something very similar happens in the unrelated language next door. There is a long history of women coming from those villages and marrying into the Yolmo area, and so our working theory is that they brought this evidential that they found useful in their own language, in Tamang, and brought it into Yolmo. They have a calque, so it's the literal bits of the word in Tamang show up as the same literal bits of the word in Yolmo."
68,150,Gretchen,"Especially, this seems to happen in communities with a lot of early multilingualism. Precisely when you have intermarriages where your parents speak different languages, and the kid grows up speaking both, from a very early age, it's not something that is a bit harder to learn as an adult to pay attention to all of this, it's like you're learning it really early, and so you're like, yeah, this is something that I'm used to paying attention to."
68,151,Lauren,These loanwords are so powerful that they shifted parts of the grammar of Yolmo to make sure that the language accounts for them.
68,152,Gretchen,"We often talk about borrowing as, okay, this word got borrowed from this language, but it's really part of a continuum with the larger history of how languages exist in contact with each other, and people often know multiple languages and use several languages flexibly. When a borrowing is really recent, we just call it 'code-switching,' and when a borrowing is really old and people have forgotten that it was a borrowing, we just call it an 'etymology,' and 'borrowing' is somewhere that's halfway in between."
68,153,Lauren,"For sure. It's all very gradient and, as we've discussed a little bit so far, very context-dependent. But to give a sense of how borrowings can be old enough that we even forget that we borrowed them in the first place, one really great example of this is a phenomenon of duplicating a word across languages."
68,154,Gretchen,"Oh, I love this one."
68,155,Lauren,'Pendle Hill' at the top of the show was one of the loanwords that I mentioned to you.
68,156,Gretchen,Does this mean 'hill hill'?
68,157,Lauren,"Well, in the 13th Century, it was called 'Pennul' or 'Penhul,' which was from the older Cumbric, which was the language that was in the area before English came in. 'Pen' -- 'pen' means 'hill,' and 'hul' meant, in Old English as it does now, 'hill.'"
68,158,Gretchen,"Oh, no."
68,159,Lauren,"But they were squashed together into 'Pennul' or 'Pendul,' and then people forgot that that original 'hill' and 'hill' were there, and so it is now 'Pendle Hill.'"
68,160,Gretchen,"So, that's 'hill hill hill.'"
68,161,Lauren,"In a very literal translation, yes."
68,162,Gretchen,"Amazing. I think there's also 'Bredon Hill' elsewhere in Britain that is also from three words that mean 'hill' all in a row. You have a Celtic word, and words keep getting added."
68,163,Lauren,"There're so many examples of this because, as people forget the original meaning, they keep adding the specifier. I'm gonna let you share a few of your favourites."
68,164,Gretchen,"One of my favourites because it exposes some etymologies that are right there in plain sight is the 'Mississippi River,' which is from the Ojibwe 'misi-ziibi.' '-ziibi' means 'river,' and 'misi-' means 'great.' This is the 'Great River River.'"
68,165,Lauren,The Great River River.
68,166,Gretchen,And you can see the same word meaning 'great' show up in 'Lake Michigan.'
68,167,Lauren,Is the 'michi-' in 'Michigan' and the 'misi-' in 'Mississippi' the same root?
68,168,Gretchen,"Yeah. Those are both 'great, large.' Guess what the '-gan' part means."
68,169,Lauren,"'Great' ... is it 'lake'? Like, 'Lake Michigan'?"
68,170,Gretchen,Yes. We have not only 'Great River River' but also 'Lake Large Lake' because there's a French alternation that happened in between.
68,171,Lauren,"There are so many, especially when we borrow words into English where we're not familiar with the underlying etymology in the language they come from. 'Mount Kilimanjaro' in Tanzania is 'Mount Mount Njaro' in Swahili."
68,172,Gretchen,"Ah, so 'kilima-' is also 'mount.'"
68,173,Lauren,Mm-hmm.
68,174,Gretchen,"Great. One that I learned recently is -- so East Timor, the country East Timor, which is also known as Timor Leste, is 'timur' also means 'east.'"
68,175,Lauren,I guess that island just above Australia was named by some people living further west of them.
68,176,Gretchen,"It sure was. Then East Timor itself is on the eastern half of the island of Timor, which is itself east of something. The 'leste' part, for the modern name 'Timor Leste,' is from the Portuguese word for 'east,' 'leste.'"
68,177,Lauren,"Oh my gosh, that was sitting right in front of my face, and I did not see that."
68,178,Gretchen,"The 'timur' is from the Indonesian and Malay word, 'timur,' meaning 'east,' and then there's several different versions of more 'east' from European languages as well."
68,179,Lauren,"I think about this a lot when I'm back in Australia. I will order a chai tea in some contexts because I want to be very specific about what I'm ordering, and 'chai' is not the default, only tea option in Australia. I will use duplicates like this occasionally."
68,180,Gretchen,"I recently saw a Tik Tok video of someone pointing out that 'naan bread' is a duplication of the same concept because 'naan' just means 'bread,' but also that the Hindi-Urdu word for Western-style sliced bread is 'pa roti,' which comes from the Portuguese 'pa,' meaning 'bread.' That's also 'bread bread.'"
68,181,Lauren,"That's also the same in Nepali, and I never knew where 'pa' came from. I would never have guessed Portuguese. But it's just 'bread bread.'"
68,182,Gretchen,It's 'bread bread.' There're many kinds of 'bread bread.'
68,183,Lauren,"It goes in both directions as well. We duplicate 'naan bread,' and they duplicate 'pa roti.'"
68,184,Gretchen,"Amazing. I think that the choice of whether to duplicate or not is a way of taking a particular linguistic stance. If you're adding the word that you're familiar with to it, then it's a way of saying, okay, this is a particular type which is not my default type. If you're refusing to add that additional word, it's a way of saying, 'No, this is my default type' or 'This is something that is more central to me, and I don't feel like I need to explain it.' But I mean, there are a lot of words in the world, and there're a lot of languages in the world, and everything is new to somebody at some point."
68,185,Lauren,"I think it's a really great reminder that when I comes to loanwords, there isn't one simple answer about how they get integrated, but they are so pervasive.

69,1,Lauren,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics! I'm Lauren Gawne."
69,2,Gretchen,"I'm Gretchen McCulloch. Today we're getting enthusiastic about what we can, must, and should say about modals. But first, our most recent bonus episode was on the different uses of 'like' in English and the very long history of them."
69,3,Lauren,"If you'd like to listen to this and all of our other bonus episodes, you can go to patreon.com/lingthusiasm. [Music]"
69,4,Gretchen,'Can' I introduce the topic?
69,5,Lauren,"Yes, you 'may' talk about modals."
69,6,Gretchen,We probably 'should' introduce modals.
69,7,Lauren,"Yeah, we 'could' introduce modals."
69,8,Gretchen,We 'gotta' talk about modals.
69,9,Lauren,We 'must' talk about modals.
69,10,Gretchen,We 'might' be talking about modals already.
69,11,Lauren,We're definitely talking using modals. They're easy to identify in English because there are nine that are commonly used.
69,12,Gretchen,"We have 'can,' 'could,' 'shall' and 'should,' 'will' and 'would,' and the triplet, 'may,' 'might,' and 'must.'"
69,13,Lauren,"They're called 'modals,' but you might also know them as 'modal auxiliaries.'"
69,14,Gretchen,"The thing about modals is they fit in this frame between the subject and then the verb all by itself in its bare form with no funny business. You have a sentence like, 'I can see,' or 'You may go.' 'See' and 'go' are just in their most unadorned forms, whereas if you have something like, 'I want to see,' or 'You are going,' then you have a 'to' or you have an '-ing' or something that's making the verb do other stuff. Whereas modals are just this thing that fits in at least -- this is in English. Spoiler alert: it's different in other languages. In English, they fit in this very unadorned way between the subject and the plain form of the verb."
69,15,Lauren,"We have that list of nine commonly used modals. There are some that you might have in your dialect that aren't necessarily common across all varieties of English. So, 'dare' as in 'I dare go' or 'I daren't go.'"
69,16,Gretchen,"And there's 'need' as in 'I need go' or 'I needn't go.' This is also a thing about modals in English is they can have '-n't' attached to them -- 'can't,' 'couldn't,' 'shan't,' 'shouldn't,' 'won't,' 'wouldn't,' 'might' -- wait, 'mayn't'? I think that's a thing in some varieties of English but not all of them -- 'mightn't' and 'mustn't,' which have a bit of a British flavour to me but are still sort of there."
69,17,Lauren,"I can use 'need,' but I would have to say, 'I don't need to do something.' I can't use that negated form of 'need' that makes it a modal."
69,18,Gretchen,"If I say, 'needn't,' I really feel like I'm putting on a variety that isn't mine. But 'need' is a modal for some speakers of English and not for other speakers of English. You can test it by saying, 'Does it behave like the rest of the modals do in English?' That's the thing about modals is they're kind of not like other verbs in English."
69,19,Lauren,You're giving them a real and quirky vibe there.
69,20,Gretchen,They're stylish. They have the mode. They're not like other verbs.
69,21,Lauren,Are we saying here that modals are the Manic Pixy Dream Verbs of English?
69,22,Gretchen,"I think modals could be Manic Pixy Dream Verbs. They're a bit quirky. They've got the big glasses. Maybe some bangs. But they do stuff in the sentence that the other auxiliaries in English like 'have' and 'do 'and 'be' can do, but they have their own particular group. They're very selective, maybe clique-ish compared to other types of verbs."
69,23,Lauren,"When you were reading the list, I noticed how a lot of them fall out in pairs. You have 'can' and 'could,' 'shall' and 'should,' 'will' and 'would,' 'may' and 'might.' That's eight of our nine all pair up really nicely."
69,24,Gretchen,"That's not an accident because 'could,' 'should,' 'would,' and 'might' are in origins the past tense forms of 'can' and 'shall' and 'will' and 'may.'"
69,25,Lauren,"I can kind of get a tense reading if it was something like, 'Today I can juggle eight tomatoes, and yesterday I could juggle seven tomatoes. I'm improving.'"
69,26,Gretchen,Amazing! Your juggling ability is --
69,27,Lauren,I definitely cannot juggle that well.
69,28,Gretchen,"Great hypothetical example sentence. Exactly. This is funny, actually, because 'could' and 'should' and 'would,' they all rhyme and they all end in O-U-L-D. With 'shall' and 'will,' that L that's silent in 'should' and 'would' is an etymological L. It used to be pronounced, and then they were like, 'Ah, yeah, an L before a D, that sounds hard. Let's not do it.'"
69,29,Lauren,"There's also one in 'could,' and there's not in 'can.'"
69,30,Gretchen,"Either we have to hypothesise that 'can' was once 'cal' or something, which is not the case."
69,31,Lauren,No evidence of that.
69,32,Gretchen,"But there is evidence that English speakers at one point added in that L -- that un-etymological L -- into 'could' just so it would look like 'should' and 'would,' even though there's no reason for it in the etymology."
69,33,Lauren,Really adding to this clique-y-ness.
69,34,Gretchen,"Exactly. This is like, 'On Wednesdays we wear Ls.'"
69,35,Lauren,"Then we have 'must' as an orphan. It kind of hangs out with 'may' and 'might,' but it doesn't have its own pair."
69,36,Gretchen,"It ends in a T, so it looks like it could be the past tense of something. It's actually the past tense of a modal that we don't use anymore in English, which was 'motan' [/moʊtæn/], /matæn/? I don't even know how you pronounce it. People stopped using it around the 13th Century. People started using just the past tense form because it was more polite because it was too rude to use 'motan' all by itself, so 'must' is this polite form in the way that 'could' and 'should' and 'would' and 'might' are all kind of more polite than 'can' and 'may' and so on."
69,37,Lauren,I definitely remember being told to not use 'must' when talking to someone else because it was very presumptuous of me to require that of someone. There's still a little bit of that politeness when expecting things of other people that still comes in there.
69,38,Gretchen,"Modals are often used to be polite, you know, 'May I do something,' 'Must I go' -- they talk about reasons why people might do things. There's also a class of what are sometimes called 'semi-modals' in English. I really like the term 'quasimodals' for them."
69,39,Lauren,"I don't even know what they are, and I'm excited by this adorable terminology."
69,40,Gretchen,"They're not, unfortunately, the modals that ring bells in the cathedral of Notre Dame. I guess you could also think of them as 'pseudo-modals.' Things like 'better' as in 'You'd better go,' 'You need to go,' 'You're supposed to go,' 'used to go' -- these are things that are not necessarily in that exact frame of 'I [blank] go' or they're not necessarily as verb-y. They have different things going on with the structure, but they seem to have similarities in terms of the meanings of the regular set of modals."
69,41,Lauren,"In addition to the fact that we've lost some modals from the group, we're growing new ones at the moment."
69,42,Gretchen,"I think that some of these quasimodals are things that are growing into modals eventually, you know, stick around for a couple hundred years, and we'll see if 'gotta,' 'hafta,' 'wanna,' if some of those turn into real modals, or if we end up with a full-fledged modal category that includes them. Stay tuned for the next 500 years where Lingthusiasm will definitely still be running, and we'll let you know how that turns out."
69,43,Lauren,I guess something like 'gotta' -- 'You gotta go.'
69,44,Gretchen,"'I gotta go,' 'You gotta go,' 'He or she gotta go.' Maybe I wanna put like a 'has got' or like '-s gotta go.' But probably in rapid speech I wouldn't say it. It's something that's somewhere in between this class of really old modals in English that do very similar things and stuff that's emerging. We still have some sense that 'gotta' is formed out of 'got to,' but we're not really saying the 'to' as a full 'to' anymore. It's somewhere in between a modal and not a modal."
69,45,Lauren,One of the most important things about modals is they're really good for making jokes. I think this is one of the most important things that we have to discuss when discussing modals in English is that they allow us to make jokes.
69,46,Gretchen,I think this is great -- especially jokes out of things that people say commonly in everyday life.
69,47,Lauren,"One of my favourites is an illustrated comic of two colourful budgerigars -- these two colourful Australian birds. The yellow one says to the blue one, 'Can we TALK?'"
69,48,Gretchen,"Ooh. This is a thing that humans say to each other when we're asking, 'Do I have permission to start a conversation?' But this is birds being like, 'Are we capable of talking?'"
69,49,Lauren,"'Do we have the capacity for speech?' which is a big question in and of itself, but makes for a cute, pithy little cartoon."
69,50,Gretchen,"I love it. There was a sign that went around Twitter a little while back that said, 'Museum gardens -- please do not cycle in the gardens, you may injure a young child or elderly person.' The comment that someone posted it with was, 'Wow. You can't cycle, but you can injure people? That's a bit messed up.'"
69,51,Lauren,[Laughs] It is a lot more threatening when you read it with the interpretation of the modal in that way.
69,52,Gretchen,"Yeah, 'Please do not cycle in the gardens, but on the other hand, you may injury a young child or an elderly person.' Like, wow."
69,53,Lauren,I'm definitely not going to that park any time soon.
69,54,Gretchen,"Yeah, I don't wanna get injured."
69,55,Lauren,"Someone was giving instructions on taking care of some house plants and said, 'You can't give these plants too much water,' which is actually a little bit stressful because I have no idea if they mean, 'It's impossible to give them too much water, you can water away,' or it means, 'You must not give these plants too much water. It is the worst thing you can do.'"
69,56,Gretchen,Yeah. That's really confusing. Don't say that to your plant sitter.
69,57,Lauren,Absolutely.
69,58,Gretchen,"I think in practice the reason why they're jokes is that in everyday conversation, we generally do figure out which meaning is intended through the intonation, how people say things, how you stress things, the context -- there's lots of ways that we do actually figure out what's going on. But this really interesting thing about modals, which is that in English we have this distinction between, okay, what's believable or what someone's able to do versus what someone has permission to do, what's allowed according to some rules."
69,59,Lauren,Starting with our plant watering.
69,60,Gretchen,"Our believable meaning is 'You're not able to give these plants too much water.' You know, 'You don't have the ability to do,' or 'It's not believable these plants could have too much water.'"
69,61,Lauren,"Whereas for permission it's, 'You're not allowed to give these plants too much water. Do not do it.'"
69,62,Gretchen,"Right. With the birds, 'Can we TALK' is 'Are we capable of talking,' 'Is it believable that we talk?'"
69,63,Lauren,"And for permission, it's like when you pop your head into the office next door, and you're like, 'Can we chat?' You're just asking for permission from the person before you have a conversation with them. They might be busy. That budgerigar might have a very important meeting to get to."
69,64,Gretchen,Budgie meetings are important. We have 'You may injury a pedestrian' -- 'It's believable that a pedestrian injury could happen.'
69,65,Lauren,"Whereas for the permission reading it's, 'You may injure a pedestrian. Go ahead. You have my permission to go ahead and injure someone who's walking by.'"
69,66,Gretchen,"I think it's worth pointing out that for some of these jokes, the serious reading is the believability one -- you know, it's believable that pedestrian injury could occur -- and for some, it's the permission reading, 'Can I get your permission to have a conversation?' It's not that only one of them is the joke-y one, the joke lies in the fact -- as I think we have analysed to death now -- that these two meanings are available and that we regularly do figure them out from context."
69,67,Lauren,These are two broad meanings that we see pop up continuously when it comes to modality. These are the two overarching groups of meaning we can put modals into.
69,68,Gretchen,"Right. I say this is something that English is ambiguous about, but a lot of other languages also make this distinction somehow. It's just that the way they do that sometimes changes depending on the language."
69,69,Lauren,It's interesting that I can't make these jokes using 'will' or 'would' in similar contexts.
69,70,Gretchen,"It's interesting because 'will' and 'would' are modals in form, but in terms of function, 'will' does things with future tense, and 'would' does things with conditionals or hypotheticals, which are definitely a topic for another episode. They are the Extra-Manic Pixy Dream Verbs. They're not like the other modals. They do their own thing even within the modal category. That's something that's less likely to potentially be the case cross-linguistically because they're doing their own thing entirely."
69,71,Lauren,"I think the joke that I see played out the most with this ambiguity is the 'Can I grab a glass of water?' -- 'I don't know, CAN you?' 'Can I go to the toilet' -- 'I don't know, CAN you?' I think we've established that if you're old enough to ask that overtly, you probably do have the capacity to use a bathroom."
69,72,Gretchen,"The joke is like, 'Why are you asking me if you're capable of doing this? Surely you know whether or not you can.' The thing I think that gets me about this joke is, first of all, it's very uncooperative, and secondly, as we've established from this joke about 'You may injure a pedestrian,' 'can' and 'may' are both ambiguous in the same way in English. Saying, 'I dunno, CAN you?' and waiting for the person to say, 'May I go to the bathroom' --"
69,73,Lauren,"Hang on. Wait a second. Is that what they're trying to get you to do when you say, 'Can I go to the toilet,' and they deliberately misinterpret it? Are they trying to get you to say, 'May I go to the toilet'?"
69,74,Gretchen,"I mean, yeah. I had a teacher who would make you wait there, squirming, with your legs crossed while you said, 'May I go to the bathroom?'"
69,75,Lauren,That's not how I would make a polite request. It sounds very old-fashioned.
69,76,Gretchen,"It is. Something that's interesting according to Google Books Ngrams is that in the 1960s, 'Can I go' started surpassing 'May I go' according to the books in Google Books. There was a point when this was a change in progress, and I guess adults started thinking, 'Oh, this is this rude thing these kids are doing,' and now it's just really unremarkable."
69,77,Lauren,"Not only is it unremarkable, but I didn't even realise it was the implicit second part of the joke. I was just making the modal ambiguity joke."
69,78,Gretchen,"Yeah, no, to me it's the really annoyingly trying to correct someone's language by pretending to not understand them, so I kinda hate it."
69,79,Lauren,"I mean, fair enough."
69,80,Gretchen,"Let's stick with the 'Can we talk,' which I think is legitimately hilarious."
69,81,Lauren,These dimensions of believability or permissibility help us also explain something very important which is how to pick a good Guinness World Record to attempt to beat.
69,82,Gretchen,Great. Is this an ambition that you have?
69,83,Lauren,I've been considering it with my hypothetical juggling skills and hypothetically getting a Guinness World Record for the most tomatoes juggled.
69,84,Gretchen,"Okay. This seems like the kind of thing that it's believable to me that the Guinness Book of World Records does have a record for how many tomatoes someone's juggled. I dunno if I believe that you personally are capable of doing that because I've seen you try to juggle, and this is maybe less believable there. But I believe that this is a thing that could be in the book somewhere. Have you thought about juggling other objects?"
69,85,Lauren,"Absolutely believable -- not for me to do, I think, in terms of believability and my ability. But there're things that they won't let me juggle, regardless of how great a juggler I am because they have a requirement that your attempt at records has to be safe, and it has to be safe for, for example, animals that are participating. I think that I probably couldn't get a Guinness World Record for the number of kittens I can juggle."
69,86,Gretchen,"Even if you are a really good juggler, it's that this could be cruel to the kittens, and so the Guinness Book of World Records is like, 'We're not gonna incentivise this. We're not gonna show up at your record competition. We're not gonna say, 'This is a thing that's allowed.' This doesn't even go in the rule book, regardless of whether you personally, Lauren Gawne, can juggle kittens.'"
69,87,Lauren,"Yeah. It actually goes in the rule book as records that you cannot, in the permission sense, attempt to break. Most of them, as I said, have to do with animals -- so no fox hunting, no world's heaviest cat because --"
69,88,Gretchen,"That seems cruel, yeah."
69,89,Lauren,-- that would be sad force-feeding. It's really a fascinating insight into the ways people have tried to injure themselves and others in attempts to get world records. No fastest drives around the world or from point to point either.
69,90,Gretchen,Like on conventional roads. Fastest driving has to be on a closed track or something.
69,91,Lauren,Yeah.
69,92,Gretchen,"I guess the Guinness Book of World Records is not saying, 'You may injure pedestrians.' They don't want you to do that."
69,93,Lauren,"Indeed, a much safer organisation than that very dangerous park."
69,94,Gretchen,"This is good to know. If you're considering trying to get a Guinness Book of World Records entry, you need to consider which things are both believable that you can do, and also which things are possible that they'll even enter into their rule book because they have all these restrictions about dangerous activities that they won't put in."
69,95,Lauren,"'What I can do' has two very specific and very distinct meanings, and they're the same distinctions that we find crop up in modals across languages."
69,96,Gretchen,That's neat. Do we have some examples of modals in other languages?
69,97,Lauren,"I'm delighted to report that in Malay, you have the same ambiguity for the modal that is 'must' -- 'mesti' in Malay. It has both that permission and believability reading. But the modal that translates roughly as 'possibly' in English -- 'mungkin' -- has only that believability use. You can be ambiguous with some Malay modals but not all of them."
69,98,Gretchen,"A lot of German modal verbs can also be used in terms of both believability or permission. One that's interesting for me is the modal verb 'sollen,' which is loosely translated as 'should.' If you have a statement like 'Tim soll eine Banane essen' -- sort of literally, 'Tim should a banana eat' -- this could mean 'Tim should eat a Banana,' like according to the nutritional guidelines, which is another set of rules, Tim should eat a banana, so that he has potassium or something like this. This is the way I would use 'should' in English. But 'Tim should eat a banana' as in 'It might be the case, someone told me it's possible, that Tim's eating a banana right now.'"
69,99,Lauren,It has that believability.
69,100,Gretchen,"Yeah, it has that believability reading. 'Tim should eat a banana every morning,' where in English I wouldn't quite use 'should' there. I'd use 'would' or I would use 'might' or 'may' or something like that. It's got the same etymology as English 'shall' and 'should,' but it's got a slightly different reading because I wouldn't quite use 'should' in that particular context."
69,101,Lauren,"This illustrates so nicely why translators and interpreters talk about modals and modality as being something that's really hard to translate because it's about whether something is believable or whether it's permissible, but it's not always a one-to-one correlation across languages."
69,102,Gretchen,"The kinds of things that are ambiguous or that have multiple meanings in one language don't necessarily have the exact same set of multiple readings. Even though there are many contexts in which multiple meanings are available for English modals, it just doesn't quite happen that 'should' is one of them. I mean, you could probably construct a context if you do it carefully enough, but it's not as common as something like 'can' or 'may' where both of the meanings are very readily available."
69,103,Lauren,"Not only do you have to distinguish in interpreting between selecting whether it's believability or permission, but you also have to get the forcefulness of the modal correct as well. In English, something like, 'You can do this,' versus 'You must do this,' 'can' is so much less forceful. You know, saying, 'Oh, yeah, you can listen to Lingthusiasm,' is definitely less threatening than like, 'You must listen to Lingthusiasm.'"
69,104,Gretchen,"'You have to listen to Lingthusiasm.' 'You ought to listen to Lingthusiasm.' Like, 'ought' is -- you can do a timeline there or a gradation of like, 'You could listen to Lingthusiasm,' 'You should listen to Lingthusiasm,' 'You must listen to Lingthusiasm.'"
69,105,Lauren,"I'm beginning to get a sense of how that feels a little bit rude. But if you're really enthusiastic about your favourite media, you might tell someone, 'You must.'"
69,106,Gretchen,"'You must watch this show that I'm super into.' There's two dimensions on which the meaning can vary. There's the forcefulness that you're imposing that opinion on someone or that you're asserting that something might be the case, and you can also say, 'My friend might be at the store,' 'Oh, they should be at the store by now,' 'They must be at the store. They must've gotten there by now. I can't conceive of anywhere else they might be' -- in terms of believability. What's interesting is English distinguishes between how strong you believe that something is the case or how strong you believe that something is allowed or obliged to be the case by changing the words. 'Can' and 'may' and 'might' are all down at this sort of like, 'Well, it might be -- you know, it's possible,' and 'must' is up there at like, 'No, this is necessarily the case. This has to exist.' What's interesting is that there's a cluster of Indigenous languages in Pacific North America -- many of them Salishan languages and languages spoken in British Columbia and around there -- that do a different thing with modals. What Indo-European languages do is they say, 'Okay, distinguishing between 'may' and 'must,' we're gonna have different words for this. But distinguishing between 'Can we talk' and 'Can we TALK,' we're gonna just use context for this.' This group of languages does the opposite. An example of this from a paper by Lisa Matthewson is from the language Stˈátˈimcets. They have a sentence 'Philomena must/might be in her house,' which is 'It's believable that Philomena may be in her house/must be in her house. I dunno how much I believe it, but it's sort of believable -- it's on this believable layer.' Versus a sentence meaning, 'You must/can/may see your husband now,' which I guess your husband's in a hospital or something like this, and now you can see him. Again, this is operating on the permission level. It's a different word from the word in the 'must/might be in her house.' But this is not committing to like, 'You have to see him,' 'You're allowed to see him.' All of this is operating on the permission level. It's just that the degree of forcefulness is not specified. This is the opposite to what the Indo-European languages do where it's not that people can't tell the difference, it's that they're using context the same way we use context in English to determine those two meanings like, 'Can we talk' and 'Can we TALK?' Which one relies on context and which one relies on the word choice depends on what your language family is."
69,107,Lauren,It's interesting to see a language like Stˈátˈimcets slice and dice the categories of permission and believability and then the strength in the opposite way to a language like English.
69,108,Gretchen,"There's a whole group of languages that do this. Stˈátˈimcets is one. Salish, Washo, Nez Perce all do this. An example from a paper about Nez Perce by Amy Rose Deal is if you're watching people clean out a cooler and throw away various things, the same sentence might mean, 'They're throwing away a lot of food that they could eat,' or the same words could also mean, 'They're throwing away a lot of food that they should eat.' This thing that has two different words in English is conveyed with the same word there. There's another really clear example where someone has come up with these very clear contexts. This is in a language called Nsyilxcen, which is also spoken around that area. One context they have here is 'You know that Mary loves to go running and often goes on runs randomly. She could also be at the store or at the school. I ask you, 'Where is Mary?'' The translation for this sentence is 'Mary might be running' using a word 'mat,' which means sort of 'might.' And now you have a sentence 'Mary runs every day to train at a marathon. She usually runs at 6:00 p.m. on Tuesdays. Today is Tuesday, and it's 6:00 p.m. I ask you, 'Where is Mary?'' In this context in English you'd say, 'Mary must be running,' but in Nsyilxcen, you have the same word 'mat,' which is the modal in that context there. It's literally the same sentence as the previous one. It's just in English where there would be this distinction there. You can ask these very specific contexts and figure out which bits of the context are relevant and which ones aren't."
69,109,Lauren,"Because for both of them it's about believability, and it doesn't matter how strong the believability is."
69,110,Gretchen,Exactly.
69,111,Lauren,"The thing I really like about these examples is that the Nsyilxcen example, it's a separate word, whereas for the Nez Perce, it's an affix on the verb. It just shows that even though they have similar semantics, they're using very different grammatical approaches to it."
69,112,Gretchen,"Exactly. There's lots of different forms that modals can be in. In English, we have this diagnostic for like, 'This is what a modal does.' But in various languages, you have to come up with language-internal reasons to be like, yeah, this is what our modals look like in this language."
69,113,Lauren,In Italian Sign Language and American Sign Language the forcefulness is indicated through having modals that are performed faster or larger or have a more intensive expression in how they're signed that shows just how strong or weak your commitment to the believability of something or the strength of the permission for your modal.
69,114,Gretchen,"So, is this a more intensive expression on the face as well or just a repeated action or a faster action with your hands?"
69,115,Lauren,You can use any of the tools that are available to you to emphasise the strength of the commitment to the modal.
69,116,Gretchen,That's great.
69,117,Lauren,"It's a really great example of how signed languages can make use of the signed modality to show grammatical features of modality. Oh gosh, I just realised they're the same word, aren't they? We have signed and spoken 'mode' for human languages, but we also have this category of 'modality' that shows believability or permission."
69,118,Gretchen,"The mode that the verb is in. I think we really need to hang the Romans out to dry on terminology here because they were the ones that decided that this particular grammatical phenomenon was also gonna be basically the mode, also like the 'vibe' of the verb, the style of the verb. We had this complaint as well in the episode about imperatives where we talked about 'mood' which also originates from 'mode.' Really, we're making 'mode' do too many things."
69,119,Lauren,It definitely is a highly overworked word in linguistics. This is a confusingly good example.
69,120,Gretchen,"I think that the use of the visual modality or the things you can do with your hands to make things more intensified kind of reminds me of the importance of intonation in modals in spoken languages to distinguish between meanings like, 'Can we talk' and 'Can we TALK?' I'm doing that with intonation."
69,121,Lauren,"We've been talking about modals deliberately loosely here in terms of English having these modal auxiliaries -- Nez Perce having affixes, Nsyilxcen having separate words. There's lots of different ways that languages can grammatically make modals."
69,122,Gretchen,In many Indo-European languages we tend to talk about modal verbs because there're a lot of them where modals do act like other verbs. They're not special. They're not Manic Pixy Dream Verbs.
69,123,Lauren,"They do regular things, and they have all the regular parts that a verb has."
69,124,Gretchen,"We talked about German as an example earlier, but a pretty clear example is in Italian. You have modal verbs 'dovere,' 'potere,' 'volere,' which mean 'necessity,' and 'possibility,' and 'volition.' You could say something like, 'Devo tornare,' 'I have to return/I have to come back'; or 'Non posso aiutarlo,' 'I cannot help him'; 'Vuolo dormire,' 'I want to sleep.' In all of these cases, you have the modal verb which has the same endings and so on that the other verbs have, and then the regular verb like 'come back' or 'help' or 'sleep' that's in its infinitive form with the R at the end -- and this is just, like, in a literal sense, more like 'have to' and 'want to.'"
69,125,Lauren,The important thing to take away here is that they have the same kind of endings and shapes as other verbs. You wouldn't necessarily pick them out as being unusual in terms of what counts as a verb in these languages.
69,126,Gretchen,"Right. Whereas the English modals are really kind of weird because most English verbs you can't just put '-n't' after them. You can say, 'I can go/I can't go,' but not 'I know how to do it/I known't how to do it,' unless you're extremely online."
69,127,Lauren,'I baken't you a cake.'
69,128,Gretchen,"'I baken't you a cake.' You didn't make me a cake. [Laughs] English has this separate class of auxiliaries that do something very particular, whereas for a lot of languages, modals are just part of the verb group in general."
69,129,Lauren,"It's a reminder that modality is about the way languages can express relationships to reality and truth and permission. It doesn't necessarily have to be a particular grammatical category, although you see that happening across different languages. In English, we have things that are modal that are more than just this specific set of modal auxiliary verbs we've been talking about."
69,130,Gretchen,"'Modals' sometimes refers to this very narrow group of auxiliary verbs, and sometimes we also have modal adjectives -- 'It's possible,' 'permissible,' 'probable,' 'conceivable,' 'obligatory.' These are all adjectives, and they're modal adjectives because you can paraphrase, 'She may know him,' 'It's possible that she knows him.'"
69,131,Lauren,"'It is conceivable that you could juggle seven tomatoes, but it is obligatory to not juggle any kittens.'"
69,132,Gretchen,"'It's permissible that you could juggle seven tomatoes. It is not permissible that you can juggle seven kittens.' Also, you have modal adverbs in English -- 'possibly,' 'necessarily,' 'likely.'"
69,133,Lauren,'It's likely I'm not going to juggle six tomatoes.'
69,134,Gretchen,"There's the narrow class of modals as their own weird thing, and then there's this broader set of modal meanings that you can use lots of different types of parts of speech to communicate."
69,135,Lauren,"Not everything that is modal has to be a verb. Languages like German and Dutch are famous -- well, famous in linguistics -- for having modal particles."
69,136,Gretchen,"This is maybe partially a characteristic of the descriptive grammatical tradition when it comes to German and Dutch. When I studied German back in school, they translated these particles for us as 'modal particles' or 'flavouring particles,' which I thought was very enticing. German has a lot of these. There's a whole list -- 'aber,' 'auch,' 'denn,' 'doch,' 'eben,' 'etwa,' 'schon,' 'nur,' 'wohl,' 'gar.' There's a really long list."
69,137,Lauren,There's definitely more on this list than the eight or nine English modals that we could list at the top of this show.
69,138,Gretchen,"When I was studying German in school, they were sort of like, 'Well, you kind of need to know about these because people do use them, but their meanings are really hard to pin down, and so we're gonna give you a few examples, and you'll pick up the rest from context, but also, don't worry about it too hard. Except worry about it even more because we're not gonna explain it.'"
69,139,Lauren,Very helpful.
69,140,Gretchen,"Yeah, super helpful. One example of the modal particles in German is if you say something like, 'Gib mir das Buch,' 'Give me the book,' that's without a modal particle. But you can also have a version with a modal particle, for example, 'Gib mir schon das Buch.'"
69,141,Lauren,What would a translation of that be?
69,142,Gretchen,"An academic translation of this is,"
69,143,Gretchen,"There's a really interesting study about double modals by a linguist named Jack Grieve. I saw''Give me the book' can be read as a neutral statement, but 'Give me schon das Buch' expresses the same proposition but contains an admonition to the hearer to act.'"
69,144,Lauren,Ah.
69,145,Gretchen,"So, the modal particle is adding this forcefulness to it. But when I learned these in school, I couldn't help but think like, we have some words that are kind of like this in English as well, and English is also a Germanic language. It would be kind of weird if German and Dutch have this, and English just somehow escaped having any modal particles, even though we don't normally talk about them as modal particles."
69,146,Lauren,"Okay. So, what would be a less poncy textbook translation of that sentence?"
69,147,Gretchen,"I could see saying that as something like, 'Just give me the book.'"
69,148,Lauren,That makes sense.
69,149,Gretchen,Or 'Give me the book already.'
69,150,Lauren,"Yeah, they're both definitely more forceful."
69,151,Gretchen,"Like, 'Just give me the book,' I guess that contains an admonition to the hearer to act. I think that 'just' in English, especially, often has that meaning. Or something like 'still' or 'even.' So, 'eben' -- again, this is the academic phrasing -- implies an 'often unpleasant fact expressed in an utterance cannot be changed and must be accepted.'"
69,152,Lauren,Okay. What would an example be?
69,153,Gretchen,"In this example, I have, 'Gute Kleider sind eben teuer,' which could be translated as 'Good clothes are expensive, and it can't be helped,' or 'Good clothes happen to be expensive.' But again, I kind of think I could say, 'Good clothes are just expensive.' That also conveys the same thing -- you know, it can't be helped; this is just how it is."
69,154,Lauren,"This is a really nice example of how English doesn't have this tradition of referring to something like 'just' as a modal particle, but if you're doing an informal translation of the German, you'll get a sense of a more expansive idea of what modality is in English by thinking of 'just' as doing something like that there."
69,155,Gretchen,"Absolutely. I think this is one of the reasons why it's really interesting to compare modals across different languages because they're the kind of thing that it's really easy to just take for granted that the way the language or languages you're super familiar with does things is the way to do things. When you start comparing things, you might either notice things about languages you know already that you hadn't noticed before that they're doing or not doing. There's a lot of these fine-grained meaning distinctions that start popping up when you're doing this cross-linguistic comparison. One of the modal particles that gets cited in Dutch as an example is 'misschien.' This word was introduced to me as it means sort of the same as 'maybe' or 'perhaps.' This makes me think that maybe 'maybe' and 'perhaps' are also modal particles in English if we had that category."
69,156,Lauren,"Even within English, there's so much variation in how people can use modals including the famous double modal, which I am so disappointed to not have in my variety of English. I was so stoked to learn about them. These are sentences like, 'I might could go to the store,' 'You might should eat before you go.' They are a feature that you find in the American South and also in parts of Scotland, I think."
69,157,Gretchen,"Yeah. I was introduced to them in a linguistics class as like, 'Here's these double modals.' And I was like, no, nobody does this. And then I was at a linguistics conference a year later, and somebody used not only a double modal but then a triple modal. I think it was like, 'I might could outta put this back in the car.' All of the linguists around us were like, 'Whoa, did you just say a triple modal?'"
69,158,Lauren,"Amazing. him give a talk about them at a conference a number of years ago. He started out this talk with a quote from, I think it was Bill Labov, a well-known sociolinguist, saying, 'Double modals -- we know they exist. You occasionally encounter people using them. They've been reported in the literature. We don't have a lot of good statistics on them because they're not actually that common.' They're just sort of quite salient to people who speak varieties of English that don't have them because they're not something that I say in my variety of English, so I would notice it if someone else does."
69,159,Lauren,"I imagine for people who do use them, it tends to be more in those informal, casual settings. They're not putting them into their written variety."
69,160,Gretchen,"Right. If you get an hour of a recording with somebody whose grammar does have double modals, you might get, like, one double modal out of it. You're not gonna be able to do a whole lot of statistics on that because you get one out of an hour. It's a lot of transcription. It's a lot of effort to do. Grieve was saying this as a preamble to doing a massive Twitter study."
69,161,Lauren,"Because Twitter is famously informal in the way people write, so you don't have that problem of people changing their writing to be more formal and losing all those amazing double modals. There's also just a lot of writing on Twitter."
69,162,Gretchen,"There's a lot of writing. He has scraped almost a billion tweets that were geotagged to be in the US somewhere containing almost 9 billion words, and of that, found 5,000 double modals which is, again, like an hour of audio recording to get one double modal. But if you have enough tweets, you don't have to transcribe all that audio, and you can still get some decent numbers. He was able to find things like which ones are more common. So, 'might can' is the runaway favourite. 'Might could' is also very common. 'May can,' 'might would' are pretty high up there, and then you go down on the list. 'Would might' and 'should could' and 'will may,' those are super low. You can see frequencies which we didn't know before."
69,163,Lauren,Super low but also still an incredibly wide range of options you have for stacking those two modals together.
69,164,Gretchen,"Yeah, it's still there, but you're more likely to get 'might can' than 'can might.' There's some ordering effects there. There's also -- because these are geotagged tweets -- he was able to find correlations between particular double modals in the American South and some that are used in areas that have a higher Black population, some that have a higher white population. There might be additional factors contributing to which double modal gets used by different groups of people."
69,165,Lauren,An amazing use of a large Twitter corpus and a really great reminder of just how hard it can be to get a sense of what people are doing with modals when it comes to studying a language. I'm thinking back to those examples you had from Nsyilxcen and Stˈátˈimcets where the authors had gone to great lengths to really specify the context that they were getting people to give them examples in.
69,166,Gretchen,"Right. There's this incredibly specific context. There's a website called the Totem Field Storyboards. They have a bunch of pictures and images that are used for various contexts when eliciting examples in different languages. They tell various kinds of stories. What they'll do is they'll tell a story and then get someone to tell it back in their language. The story provides a lot of context for modals to be used with very precise meanings and contexts, so that when you have the example, you can find out exactly which things are relevant in particular contexts, and maybe there're some other things that you haven't accounted for, but at least you have pinned down a few that you know about from other languages in the area or something."
69,167,Lauren,"I had a similar methodological consideration when I was doing research on Lamjung Yolmo because I was looking at evidentials but also modals. I used a whole range of different experiments. I taught people how to do magic tricks because magic tricks play around with people's certainty. If something disappears from a box, they're going to suddenly be a lot less certain about where they think the coin has gone. I used optical illusions to make people debate what they thought they were seeing."
69,168,Gretchen,"This is sort of like, 'It might be a duck; it might be a rabbit' kind of thing."
69,169,Lauren,"Yeah. I used that one. It went very badly, but there were some amazing hand painting someone had done where they'd painted their hands to look like a duck or a crocodile. When people were showing each other and discussing them, you got varying levels of ability to be certain about what they were seeing in these images, and you could track that across the conversation in a way that was much more controlled than just people chatting and you're not quite sure which bit of their knowledge state they're reflecting."
69,170,Gretchen,"I think things like humour, like the 'Can we talk' example, or you know, 'You may injure a pedestrian,' sometimes elucidates these particular contexts, or talking about them in these very controlled environments. One of the things that tricky about modals is you have to be really careful about the paraphrases because sometimes the paraphrases are themselves ambiguous. 'Is able to' is itself ambiguous. Sometimes, you'll get this in a classroom or something. You'll say, okay, students, you need to create a paraphrase for these two situations. One of the paraphrases will itself be ambiguous. You're like, the student probably knows what's going on, and it's clear in your head, but the really slippery thing about modals is there're so many different meanings going on."
69,171,Lauren,I guess the important thing to remember that there are these two broad categories of believability and permission. Languages can use a whole variety of different grammatical means of doing those things and how strongly they believe or how strongly they require permission or give permission for something. But this is one of the driving principles of modality.
69,172,Gretchen,"And which things are left underspecified and which things are specified very precisely differs across language. You could say that any language 'can' convey modality, but they differ in which factors they 'must' use to convey them."
69,173,Lauren,Excellent use of modals there.
69,174,Gretchen,Thank you.
69,175,Lauren,"Of course, I think the other really important takeaway is that you know that in order to achieve a Guinness World Record, it needs to be both permitted and believable. That's why you're not gonna be seeing me juggling tomatoes any time soon."

70,1,Gretchen,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics! I'm Gretchen McCulloch. I'm here with Dr. Evelina Fedorenko who's an Associate Professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and we're getting enthusiastic about how brains make language work. Hello, Ev!"
70,2,Ev,"Hi, Gretchen."
70,3,Gretchen,"Hi, thank you so much for coming."
70,4,Ev,My pleasure. Thanks for having me.
70,5,Gretchen,"We always start by asking our guests, 'How did you get into linguistics?'"
70,6,Ev,"I liked learning languages when I was little. That was my schtick. I was in a school were English was started pretty early. Then my mom wanted me to be a citizen of the world, so at age 9 or 10, I started learning French. Eventually, we added Spanish and Polish because I had some Polish ancestry, German, a couple others. And so, I enjoyed that. I liked seeing patterns in languages."
70,7,Gretchen,This feels very relatable.
70,8,Ev,"Yeah, but I didn't really know what to do with that. I was growing up in Russia, I should say, and I knew that I wouldn't stay there in the long run. But I couldn't quite see yet how I could use all these languages in a professional way. I didn't wanna be an interpreter. It just wasn't really clear to me what else I could do. When I started my undergraduate degree, I took a class in linguistics, and then later in cognitive science, and learned that you can basically study language and how we process language for a living, and so that's what I've been doing ever since."
70,9,Gretchen,"Amazing. I think I went through that 'Oh, I like learning languages.' 'So, you're gonna be a translator at the UN?' And I was like, 'Uh, no, but what else is there?'"
70,10,Ev,"That's right, yeah."
70,11,Gretchen,How did that get you into your current research topic?
70,12,Ev,"Well, I started out as an undergrad researcher doing some behavioural experiments and then realised that I want to do this for a living, so I applied for graduate programs. I came to MIT. I was a grad student here as well. That was in 2002. I initially wasn't sure exactly what kind of questions I wanna pursue. But then gradually I got really interested in the relationship between language and other cognitive capacities. So, questions like, 'Do we use the same mechanisms, the same neural machinery, to understand language and to do math,' or to process structure in music, or something like that. For those kinds of questions, behavioural experiments just cannot directly answer them. The best tool that exists for answering these questions is functional MRI where you can directly have people do a language task and, say, a music task or a language task and some logical reasoning tasks and see if the same brain areas are activated. I started working with Nancy Kanwisher, first developing robust tools for finding language responsive areas in individual brains, and then over the next, I guess, 15 years or so, trying to understand what it is that these regions are doing and how they relate to other systems that we have in our brains."
70,13,Gretchen,"Let's say you're trying to study this as a behavioural task, what does a behavioural task look like?"
70,14,Ev,You mean trying to understand the relationship between language and other things?
70,15,Gretchen,"Yeah, so if you're trying to compare language and music or language and math or something, what would you be even trying to do?"
70,16,Ev,"There's generally two behavioural approaches that you can use for these kinds of questions. One is called a dual task approach, so you're trying to get people to do two things at once, and you're trying to see whether the difficulty that you get when you're doing these two things is above and beyond the additive difficulty of each of the tasks. Okay?"
70,17,Gretchen,"Okay. So, this is like rubbing your head and patting your stomach at the same time?"
70,18,Ev,Exactly.
70,19,Gretchen,"If this is hard, it's because they're both movement tasks, and they're in different directions, but the idea is you're trying to sing a song and also do some math problems at the same time. And if this is really hard then maybe that tells you something."
70,20,Ev,"Exactly. You always would need control conditions and all sorts of things to make reasonable inferences. That's one thing. Another thing you can do is relying on individual differences. You can look across a bunch of individuals and say, okay, are people who are good at math, as measured by some battery of tasks or whatever, are also good at music. Again, you'd wanna control for some basic general goodness of brains. People vary in how good their brains are, how quickly they work. But above and beyond some kind of general shared variance, is there a meaningful relationship between, say, how good your linguistic ability is and your musical ability -- these kinds of things."
70,21,Gretchen,These feel kind of indirect.
70,22,Ev,"Exactly. For individual differences, you just also need vast samples to draw meaningful inferences. It's painstaking, and the tasks are sometimes tricky to get just the right difficulty so you can get some variability. Some people are better and worse."
70,23,Gretchen,Right. Because if everyone's getting 100% on the task then that's not gonna tell you anything about what some people are better at than others.
70,24,Ev,That's right. Yeah.
70,25,Gretchen,"This seems very complicated. So, instead, we stick them in the brain. We make them do some math. We make them listen to some language. We make them listen to some music or something. And then we see which bits light up."
70,26,Ev,That's right.
70,27,Gretchen,There's a couple different ways we could look at them in the brain. There's different types of machines to do studies in. The two that I'm most familiar with are MRI and EEG. Can you tell us a little bit about what the difference is between those and why you pick MRI for your particular type of studies?
70,28,Ev,"Sure. EEG is basically recordings of electrical activity from the scalp. It's a signal that is very temporally precise. You know millisecond by millisecond how these very small voltage changes happen, but you don't really know where the signal is coming from."
70,29,Gretchen,"This is the one when you see picture of it, you see people with a sort of skull cap on their heads with all the little nodes and electrodes like you're in a scientific experiment. Because your brain makes electricity as you're thinking, if you contract that electricity, but very imprecisely because you're doing it through your hair and your scalp and your skull and all of this layers of fluid and stuff, you kind of know it's happening maybe in the left and the front."
70,30,Ev,"Exactly. That's the very coarse level. For questions like, 'Do two abilities draw on the same resources,' this is just not good enough. Even though people have tried to use it in those ways, I think it's limited. In fMRI, instead, we basically take images of the brain. We can take anatomical images, which are just static, detailed images of people's anatomy and takes a few minutes. You can take a really good image. Of course, what's more valuable to people who are interested in brain function are functional images. There, we can't take very precise images because we're trying to take them fast enough to measure changes over the course of seconds. That's about as good as we can get in most circumstances with fMRI. We take a very coarse image every two seconds, typically, in most typical sequences. Then we try to look at, basically analyse, brightness levels which reflect changes in blood flow. Through this general approach we can, with very high precision, figure out where exactly in the brain are these changes happening. So, which are the bits of the brain that are working harder when you're, say, solving a math problem or listening to a piece of music."
70,31,Gretchen,"So, the MRI -- it's the same machine; it's just how many pictures you're taking, how quickly, between functional and the regular MRI."
70,32,Ev,"It's different sequences, that's right."
70,33,Gretchen,"You go into the massive tube, which is a big magnet, and the magnet is effectively measuring the iron in the blood in your brain that's being used more in some areas than in others."
70,34,Ev,"Exactly. When some brain area works, cells fire, and to fire, cells need glucose and oxygen. If some area is working hard, there's gonna be an increase in blood flow to replenish the supplies that have been used up, and we're detecting these changes."
70,35,Gretchen,"Then you can see relatively fine-grained where the blood is going, so if you wanna see where stuff is in the brain, you wanna use an MRI."
70,36,Ev,"Exactly, yeah."
70,37,Gretchen,"The EEG gives you stuff down to the millisecond, but the MRI is like, 'Okay, every two seconds, that's as close as we can get,' because there's always a trade off between how fine-grained a location you can figure out and how fine-grained a time thing you can figure out."
70,38,Ev,That's exactly right.
70,39,Gretchen,"Maybe someday we'll come up with a technology that lets us do both, but that doesn't exist right now."
70,40,Ev,"Yeah. No, there are people who are combining EEG. They actually have people wear these caps and scan them at the same time. I have yet to see the use of this combined technology to answer some deep question. Mostly, it seems like a technical feat to deal with all the artefacts that you get from these channels. But I haven't seen any really cool discoveries from the combination of the two methods. There is another method which is very limited in the population that we can test with it, but it's intracranial recordings. Occasionally, when people undergo surgery, we can get access to the brain directly, and then we know exactly where we are, and we can get very fine time resolution."
70,41,Gretchen,But it's a little bit harder to get people to undergo surgery just to do a study in your lab. [Laughs]
70,42,Ev,"No, no, no, it's only for people who clinically need this, which is either when they have drug-resistant epilepsy or when they have a tumour or when they need a deep stimulation device implanted as in cases of Parkinson's disease or something like that."
70,43,Gretchen,"So, if people are already having brain surgery for some other reason, then you can say, 'Well, let's figure out where your language centre is.'"
70,44,Ev,"Yeah, that's right."
70,45,Gretchen,This brings us to this question of where your language centre is and what you normally find in people's brains when it comes to where language is.
70,46,Ev,"Sure. First, I think it's sometimes helpful to just draw the distinction between speech and language because I don't know if that often comes up in your podcast. I've heard some episodes, but not all of them. There is the acoustics of speech -- or for sign languages, there're some visual basic processing, or for reading, there's also some perceptual, visual cortexes to recognise the letters. There're specialised mechanisms for this perceptual analysis. Then after the information is analysed through these perceptual mechanisms, we have to interpret the signal. Basically, once we've extracted the sequence of words, we're trying to understand what the meaning of the sequence of words is. That's the system that we've primarily studied. This is a set of brain areas that, in most people, are in their left hemisphere. There're some frontal components, so the front of the head and the side of the head and the temporal lobe. Those regions basically work whenever you understand language, regardless of whether you read it or heard it or if somebody signed to you if you're a speaker of a sign language. It also works when you produce language -- when you're converting a thought into a sequence of words for somebody else to understand. It seems like the system is basically storing our knowledge of language, and so we can use it to convert from thoughts into messages or decode messages that we hear or read."
70,47,Gretchen,"That's really important because you don't wanna be like, 'Oh, we found language. It turns out it's actually just the part that's involved in processing the sound of the human voice, and we don't use it at all for reading,' or signers don't use it, but if you can find something that's in common between all of these different formats, then it's like, this is the bit that's the core thing that we think is actually doing language irrespective of what modality it exists in."
70,48,Ev,That's absolutely right.
70,49,Gretchen,"You said that most people have the language processing bits on the left-hand side. I remember hearing about this when I was about 13, and I was newly getting into linguistics. I learned that it was basically all right-handed people that have their language hemisphere on the left side of their brain because when it comes to physical control of the body, the left side of the brain controls the right-hand side, and the right-hand side controls the left. Then still a lot of left-handed and ambidextrous people also have their language hemisphere on this left side. But then there're a few of the left-handed and ambidextrous people who process their language on the right-hand side or on both sides. I've always wondered, hey, I'm left-handed -- am I part of this anomaly group? When I was an undergrad, I did a lot of psych studies or whatever because they pay you $10.00, and it was a good deal, and I buy lunch."
70,50,Ev,Good stuff!
70,51,Gretchen,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. [Laughs] But I always got excluded for the brain scan ones -- the fMRI ones -- because they were like, 'Oh, we're not doing left-handed people because you have this massive confound of you might have your language hemisphere on the wrong side.' It was like, 'Yes, that's what I wanna know!' I was really excited that you agreed to let me come into your MRI machine and find out, for once and for all, for no practical purpose, but like, I would like to know, and also then my data can be added to your studies, which side my language hemisphere is on. We have those results."
70,52,Ev,"Yeah, we do. We have those results from when we scanned you."
70,53,Gretchen,"Oh, so this is my brain?"
70,54,Ev,"This is your brain. Your language system is very left lateralised, as in most people."
70,55,Gretchen,"So, I'm not a special person. I'm just like everyone else."
70,56,Ev,You're a very special person. [Laughter] Just not for this reason.
70,57,Gretchen,"Not for this reason. I'm seeing these black and white scans, and then some areas that are really lit up in red and yellow. The lit-up bits are in the left hemisphere mostly, and they're in this V shape around the side where my ear would be."
70,58,Ev,That's right.
70,59,Gretchen,"Cool. And I mean, obviously the colours chosen are sort of arbitrary, but it's something that's lit up."
70,60,Ev,"Of course, yeah. When we show people -- like when we look at language system activations, this based on the contrast between people processing language. Sometimes we use auditory stimuli. Sometimes we use written stimuli. Like I said, the system doesn't really seem to care one way or the other. Then we compare the response during the language condition to a control condition where, in terms of the perceptual properties, the stimulus is similar, but it doesn't have any meaning or structure in it. For example, you did a task where you read sentences as opposed to sequences of non-words. You just kind of hear, 'floor,' 'blanket,' something. You can't make sense of them, but they sound speech-like. We subtract that from the language responses, and then we get these regions that work more."
70,61,Gretchen,"So, we don't want it to have the bit that's lit up when I am reading anything that looks like a shape on a white square or something like that."
70,62,Ev,That's right.
70,63,Gretchen,"I'm also seeing here that there are some bits in the right hemisphere that are lit up -- not quite in this nice V shape, but there're still some bits that are lit up. Can you tell me anything about that side?"
70,64,Ev,"Yes. In fact, in the majority of left-lateralised people, there is some response in the right hemisphere as well. There's still a lot of debate about how exactly right hemisphere regions contribute to language processing. We're trying to evaluate some of those ideas. In the vast majority of people, there's some response -- some nice, replicable response. It's usually weaker. I also have a graph that shows you how much activity those different regions show. This is responses now to those two conditioned sentences and sequences of non-words. You can see that the dark bar, the sentence response, is much higher -- like twice stronger -- in the left hemisphere. But there's still a response in the right hemisphere."
70,65,Gretchen,"That's still a stronger response than the right hemisphere compared to the non-words. Like, maybe twice as much a response to the non-words as to the words themselves. Obviously, I want to know this for personal gratification, but the finding that most people's language is processed on the left is something that I read about when I was 13. It's old news when it comes to, okay, which side is language on. What are you trying to study that's a deeper version of that question now?"
70,66,Ev,"Well, there's still a lot of interesting puzzles. One thing that we still don't know as a field is whether having language be atypically lateralised -- so right lateralised or bilateral, present in both hemispheres -- whether that makes you in some way worse at language. We don't know that. There's mixed evidence so far, but I think also this question hasn't been investigated in large enough populations and with sufficiently sensitive tests -- both neural, in the brain, and behavioural tests. I think that question is still a little bit in the open. We've spent some time trying to develop tasks that would allow us to get variability in the neurotypical population in terms of their language skills because most tests that exist to assess people at the individual level come from either the developmental literature or the literature on individuals with language disorders like aphasia following a stroke or something like this. If we take those tests and administer them to college undergraduates, they'll all perfectly accurate, like you were saying. Then we can't get that variance. We've been trying to develop sensitive tests of language comprehension and production to try to see if we can then relate that variability to how lateralised their responses are. That's all work in progress."
70,67,Gretchen,"If I had turned out to have language on both sides or on the right-hand side then you'd be like, 'Ah, and now we can use this to see what your responses are like to these kinds of things.'"
70,68,Ev,"Exactly. We now know -- we as a field, and my lab specifically -- we know that it doesn't seem like you can't have a perfectly functional language system on the right. So, at least in cases where you have extensive early damage in the left hemisphere -- that happens sometimes when you have an early stroke as a child or even prenatally -- these individuals will typically end up with a perfectly functional system in the right hemisphere. We've been working with this interesting individual who was born without her left temporal lobe. Her system is fully right lateralised. Her language is great. She even was like, all the most sensitive tests, we've tested, and she didn't even know that she was missing her left temporal lobe until she was about 20-something."
70,69,Gretchen,"Oh my gosh. So, she's just missing this massive part of the front left above the ear of the brain and nobody noticed because the rest of her brain just took over."
70,70,Ev,"Yeah. She has an advanced degree. She is very smart. We're growing that line of work. That suggests that, from early on, the two hemispheres are -- 'equipotential' is sometimes a term that people will use -- either can develop a language system. Now, for some reason, in most people it still ends up on the left. Something about that bias is making it advantageous to have it there."
70,71,Gretchen,"This made sense to me when I was thinking about, okay, well, right-handed people, maybe it's because they use the right-handed side more, and so something to do with maybe writing and language although, of course, there's lots of language that isn't writing as well, which made it fascinating for me from a left-handed perspective of like, 'Okay, well, then logically I should be using the right hemisphere,' and yet, still most left-handed people have it on the left as well, which is the puzzle that I find interesting. Are you trying to scan a lot of left-handed people because the odds that they're gonna have some other lateralisation things are higher?"
70,72,Ev,"Yeah. I mean, it's something -- we're not exclusively doing this right now. There may be project that will start on that. But mostly we've been focusing on other kinds of questions like -- yeah, there's so many questions to ask. I usually try to keep my lab relatively small, so I can work closely with all the people in the lab as opposed to letting it become hierarchically structured, which is just inevitable if your lab grows enough. We're focusing on other -- yeah."
70,73,Gretchen,What kinds of questions are you trying to answer now?
70,74,Ev,"One question that we've tackled among the first ones is the relationship between language and thought. We found across multiple approaches, but fMRI prominently, that the regions in your brain -- so these regions you were just looking at in this graph that work really hard when you understand or produce language -- they don't work at all when you're doing math or solve logical problems or think about other people's mental states. The system is very, very strongly selective for processing linguistic information."
70,75,Gretchen,"Even though you can use language when you're doing math, or you could use language when you're thinking about other people's mental states? You could talk about other people's mental states. Or you can talk about math. But that's different."
70,76,Ev,"That's right. Language and thought have historically been conflated in all sorts of contexts because, of course, how people speak and what they say is our prime source of evidence for what's going on in their mind. It's a reflection. We can evaluate people how well they think by how they structure their linguistic utterances. But it turns out that the mechanisms that we use for those two things are completely non-overlapping. In fact, perhaps the most compelling evidence that's complementary to fMRI comes from patients with what's known as 'global aphasia.' This is severe, severe damage to the language system, so typically due to a very large stroke that happens in this large artery that supplies this frontal and temporal cortex. These people basically can't produce, can't understand anything, and yet, they can do math and solve sudoku puzzles, and do all sorts of sophisticated reasoning. This is this centuries-old question about language and thought with a lot of theorising and a lot of strong claims about how you need language to think complex thoughts. It turns out that you really don't. That's one big thing we've figured out."
70,77,Gretchen,How would you go about studying that in an fMRI machine? Can you do a sudoku? They can't really write.
70,78,Ev,"Yeah, you can get them to do all sorts of -- I mean, we haven't looked at sudoku puzzles specifically, but basically, yeah, you put them in the scanner just like we did with you. We find their language regions, and then we also ask them to do non-language tasks like solve some math problems or do a hard-working memory task, like I think you did a spatial memory task as one of the tasks."
70,79,Gretchen,"I did one where I looked at a bunch of blue squares. I guess this is also the point to say that I did another interview with Saima Malik-Moraleda, who was the PhD student and the technician who ran me through all of these tasks. We broke down all of the tasks in detail and sort of what I was looking for in each of the tasks and what I was looking at. That is a bonus episode, which you can get access to at patreon.com/lingthusiasm. You can see the details about what I did in the machine and what it was like in the machine there. Returning to this question of what are you trying to look at, how do you test people's reasoning of other people's mental states in a machine?"
70,80,Ev,"That's a good question. There's a number of paradigms that exist that one standard one is actually a verbal paradigm, but of course it's verbal in both conditions. If you find a difference, it's not due to language processing. But a common contrast that people use is processing little stories, little vignettes, about thinking about somebody else's mental state, which is now incorrect. For example, 'Gretchen thought that Ev had put her computer on this shelf,' or something like this, or 'Gretchen saw Ev put this somewhere here, and then Gretchen went away, and then I moved it.'"
70,81,Gretchen,"And then I come back in -- okay, yeah, I think I have encountered this as the Sally-Anne task or something which they do on children."
70,82,Ev,"Exactly right. Then there's a control version where there's no mental states involved, but there's still a difference between some representation of reality and reality. It's known sometimes as the false photograph condition. For example, 'I took a picture of Gretchen's house when I was visiting her last year. Since then, she added a whole other level, and now the house is three stories tall' -- my representation, my picture that I took, and reality, and they're different. In terms of the structure of the task, it's similar if you're thinking about somebody else's state, which differs from reality, but there's no mental state as such. That contrast gives you so-called 'theory of mind' regions. There's a professor at MIT here in the same department, Rebecca Saxe, who has discovered this brain system and has been characterising it for the last couple decades, I guess."
70,83,Gretchen,In terms of what's involved when you're thinking about other people's states of knowledge.
70,84,Ev,Yes. That system seems distinct from the language system quite strongly.
70,85,Gretchen,"Right. Because I was thinking how are you going to try to tell people about people's mental states without using language, but if you just use language in both conditions --"
70,86,Ev,"That's right. Or you can also show people videos -- you know, silent films. We make all sorts of rich inferences about what people are thinking from what they're doing even if there's no language at all. There is actually a version of this task that our lab and Rebecca Saxe's lab has been using based on just watching silent animation films and then contrasting responses to when you have little clips, which invoke you thinking about other's thoughts and beliefs and so on compared to some control clips where there's maybe some social interaction, but there's no real thinking of, you know, 'What am I thinking that Gretchen is thinking right now?'"
70,87,Gretchen,Right. Okay. And those don't seem to involve a language part.
70,88,Ev,"No, not at all."
70,89,Gretchen,"Because I was thinking, okay, put me in the machine, tell me to think about some stuff, you know, okay, what do we know from this, but you have these very controlled environments where you're like, okay, you're figuring out what people are thinking and what the mental states are of the people in the video."
70,90,Ev,"That's right. That's one thing we learned is that the language system is quite specialised for language processing. We've also been doing a bunch of stuff with diving into this system and trying to see do different parts of the that system -- you saw that there's quite a few regions, right, that are active when we process language. Do different regions process different aspects of language? Is there a region that maybe processes linguistic structure and some other region that processes words? That turns out not to be the case. From what we can tell from many dozens of experiments across our group and other groups, it seems that this distinction between word meanings and linguistic structure is not realised in terms of a spatial separation into distinct regions. It seems the very same regions that care about structure in language also deeply care about meaning, so individual words."
70,91,Gretchen,"There's a certain level of specialisation in terms of this area is used for visual language or this language is used for auditory language, but apart from when it comes to processing different types of meaning, are there any regions that do specialised things there? Or is it like, 'Ugh, we just don't know,' or there's so much individual variability?"
70,92,Ev,"No, it's a good question. I mean, the language system is specialised for language relative to all sorts of other things, right -- non-linguistic things. But in terms of the divisions within the language system, it's been hard to find those. People have made claims that some parts of the system do -- you know, there is a very strong claim from a few groups over the years that some subset of the system is specialised for syntactic processing, structure processing, and language, so figuring out the dependencies between words, and is relatively insensitive to what 'table' means. But it seems that, with robust enough methods, you find that that distinction is just not there. It looks like it's a distributed processing of both syntactic components of language and word meanings."
70,93,Gretchen,"Right. So, being able to pin down, okay, not only this is where the specific word 'table' is stored, but like, this is my dictionary where all of the meanings are stored, and this is my grammar where all of the relationships of like, 'Ah, here's what verbs do, here's what nouns do.'"
70,94,Ev,That seems to be it.
70,95,Gretchen,"Yeah, like, this is how linguists like to organise their writing, but it's not necessarily what the brain is actually doing internally, which is sort of disappointing because it'd be nice if we'd stumble on the right thing the first time."
70,96,Ev,"Yeah, that's right. But I think in a lot of -- as I'm sure you know -- in a lot of linguistic traditions, the grammatical information is actually very deeply tied to meanings of particular words. It's not this very abstract level where a sentence is made up of a noun and a verb, but instead there's very particular combinatorial constraints of how each word combines with other kinds of words."
70,97,Gretchen,"Maybe it's something where, okay, so you need to know for the word 'eat' specifically that you can say, 'I eat,' and you can also say, 'I eat a sandwich,' but for something like --"
70,98,Ev,'Devour.'
70,99,Gretchen,"'Devour' -- 'I devour a sandwich,' but 'I devour' by itself doesn't work even though 'eat' and 'devour' otherwise mean the same thing."
70,100,Ev,Very similar. That's right.
70,101,Gretchen,"You can't just have one abstract thing. You have to be thinking about it at every individual word, 'What does it do with relation to the grammar?'"
70,102,Ev,"Yeah, that's right."
70,103,Gretchen,Cool. You're also looking at stuff to do with multiple languages.
70,104,Ev,"We are. We are very interested in how individuals who speak many languages -- two or more languages -- represent and process those languages. That, of course, has been a question of interest for many years. I got into this work originally through work on polyglots, so individuals who learn sometimes many dozens of languages. We had a project -- this line of work that I kind of got involved in accidentally. I just had somebody contact me and say, 'I have a teenage child who has learned 26 languages, and he keeps learning them, would you be interested in scanning them?' And I was like, 'Yeah, yeah, we can look at that. That sounds interesting, yeah.' At that time, I didn't really know if we were gonna just do this kind of as a one-off thing or really go into this line of work, especially because there's not many polyglots. It's a pretty rare population. But we brought him in, and we scanned him. One thing I noticed is that -- so he's a native English speaker. He's American. When we looked at his responses during his native language processing, his language regions looked like they were not looking very hard. They looked smaller, and they weren't very active. I was like, 'Well, that's interesting.'"
70,105,Gretchen,"Because you might think, 'Oh, well, you're using language regions a lot of the time. You've got this big, buff language region.' Like, if I used my shoulder muscles a lot, they get bigger, you know."
70,106,Ev,"That's absolutely right. So, I was like, 'Oh, well, maybe just something' -- I mean, we scanned him on a couple different sessions, and we saw that it's a replicable thing. So, how big your language regions are is actually quite stable within people. But I didn't really know what to make of it. Then I had a postdoc who is now faculty in Canada in Carleton, Olessia Jouravlev. When she was here, she was interested in multilingualism. She found a couple other polyglots and scanned them. Then she kept finding them, and we kept scanning them. And so eventually, we had a sample of, you know, on the order of 20 people. It turns out that this result -- this smaller language region -- is a real thing in polyglots compared to monolinguals and bilinguals. They have a smaller language system. The way that we interpreted this is as greater efficiency, like your language system doesn't have to work as hard, perhaps because you're training it so much by learning all these different languages. But we also don't know. Maybe their language system is different from the start and without doing longitudinal work --"
70,107,Gretchen,"Ideally, you'd wanna study somebody who starts out speaking one or two languages, and then they keep acquiring more throughout their life, and see, like, do their language centres get smaller as they use them more, or do they already start out smaller, and this creates a predisposition to becoming a polyglot because they're already more efficient at it."
70,108,Ev,That's absolutely right.
70,109,Gretchen,"Because anecdotally I feel like some people have an easier time in language classes, and I've never quite been sure why that's the case."
70,110,Ev,"That's absolutely right. There's definitely variability there, but it's also like, people for whom it comes easy, they're a pretty heterogeneous population. Different aspects of language seem to be easy for different people. Some people are really good imitators. You can tell them a sequence of sounds in any language totally unfamiliar to them, and they can repeat it beautifully. Some people are just really good at learning words. They hear a word; they just don't forget it. Some people are really good at deciphering grammatical patterns like how words combine and how they agree and all that stuff. It would be really nice to try to unpack this and see if these different linguistic talents, if you wish, are actually meaningfully different. For now, all we have --"
70,111,Gretchen,"Earlier, we were like, 'Oh, well, it doesn't seem like there's one area in the brain that does words and one area that does grammar.' But it does seem like there're some people who are really good at words and some people who are really good at grammar, who are really good at sounds."
70,112,Ev,Yeah.
70,113,Gretchen,It's hard to say what that is.
70,114,Ev,"That's right. It's not incompatible with not having a spatial separation within the system. It could be like, you know, maybe your language system is more strongly tied to your memory mechanisms or something like that."
70,115,Gretchen,"Right. Or like, these things are all working together in your brain to do X. And these things are all working together to do Y within that. I might venture to guess that there might be a higher proportion of Lingthusiasm listeners who might be polyglots. Are you still doing the study, if people are polyglots, and they're in the Boston area?"
70,116,Ev,That'd be great. We've been scanning people here in Boston.
70,117,Gretchen,"If people wanna come in and get their brain scanned because you speak several languages, they can get in touch."
70,118,Ev,"They should get in touch, yeah."
70,119,Gretchen,Great. We'll link to that in the description. You guys tested me for English and French because those are the languages that I operate in the most -- even though I have smatterings of linguistic knowledge of other things.
70,120,Ev,That's right.
70,121,Gretchen,Can you tell me anything about what I'm doing for French?
70,122,Ev,Your language systems works when you process French. It actually works --
70,123,Gretchen,My neighbours in Montreal will be relieved to hear that.
70,124,Ev,That's right. It actually works a little bit harder compared to English. In this graph I'm showing you here -- this is how much it works when you process French. This is how much it works when you process English.
70,125,Gretchen,"Okay, so those are big bar lines, and the English one's halfway up, and the French one's three quarters of the way up."
70,126,Ev,"That's right. Then there's a couple of control conditions. If you may remember, you heard these things -- we call them 'quilted' or 'textured' speech. I mean, it kind of sounds like speech, but you can't really make sense of it. It's really muffled and degraded. Then a couple of unfamiliar languages, which typically will elicit some response in people. So, this is Basque and Tamil, which I don't think you have familiarity with."
70,127,Gretchen,"Yeah, I don't speak either of those, no."
70,128,Ev,"Those are lower than either of the languages that you speak. There's also interesting -- so Saima Malik-Moraleda, who you talked to as well, she's been noticing that in same bilingual and multilingual people, responses to unfamiliar languages seem stronger than in people who are monolingual."
70,129,Gretchen,"So, you're trying to parse them even though you don't actually know what's going on."
70,130,Ev,"Exactly. So, you may have some kind of generally increased sensitivity to trying to decipher something from linguistic utterances if you're linguistically attuned."
70,131,Gretchen,"I noticed when they were playing for me the Basque and Tamil I was thinking, 'Oh, how interesting. I don't think I've heard a passage in either of these languages that's this long before. I wonder if I can figure out what the phonology of them is; what sort of sounds they have in comparison to other languages I know.' I was kind of trying to go into language processing. I wonder if that's something that you could train people to do with practice."
70,132,Ev,"Perhaps, yeah. Don't know. We haven't tried. I'm not aware of anybody who had tried, but it's possible, yeah."
70,133,Gretchen,"I mean, what makes some people learn more languages than others, and also, could any of this help someone learn a language if they're -- because this is a difficult task for a lot of people trying to learn a language in adulthood. Is there anything that could make it easier for them to do it? Although, I guess that's very early stages."
70,134,Ev,"Right. I mean, so far, the best advice we can give is just do it earlier because it does help. [Laughter]"
70,135,Gretchen,Go back in time and tell your parents.
70,136,Ev,Or do it for your kids or something.
70,137,Gretchen,"Thank you so much for coming on the podcast. If you could leave people knowing one thing about linguistics, what would that thing be?"
70,138,Ev,"That's a very good question. I mean, I think I would probably emphasise this result that I briefly talked about that language is not the same thing as thought even though sometimes intuitively it feels like we're talking to ourselves all the time, it turns out that's even not a universal. Some people don't feel like they have a voice in their heads. Some people who do a lot of thinking about, for example, math, some professional mathematicians will say that when they get this voice, it interferes with their thinking. The thinking that happens in your brain doesn't happen in the same system that you use to understand language and to produce language. I think that's important to know. Even though people sometimes have very strong intuitions about language being really a key part of complex thinking, that just doesn't seem to be empirically true."
70,139,Gretchen,That's really interesting. Thank you so much. [Music]

70,141,Ev,Stay lingthusiastic! [Music]
71,1,Lauren,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics! I'm Lauren Gawne."
71,2,Gretchen,"I'm Gretchen McCulloch. Today, we're getting enthusiastic about the vocal folds. But first, Lauren, I just have something to say. I'm really jealous of the chemistry people."
71,3,Lauren,Okay. Why is that?
71,4,Gretchen,"They have all these cool versions of the Periodic Table of the Elements. You can get it in different colours and aesthetics and designs. We have a table that gets used a lot in linguistics, the International Phonetic Alphabet chart, but it just looks very boring. I want more versions of it."
71,5,Lauren,"Yeah, there are a lot of details on the International Phonetic Alphabet charts, which is great if you need to know what's in each of the columns and the rows. But there's a lot happening. Once you know how it's all set out, I don't really read those anymore. I'm there to just find the specific symbol that I need."
71,6,Gretchen,"Right. I was thinking we could make a version that's abstract and stylised. If you don't know about the IPA, it would just look like some cool symbols in a grid."
71,7,Lauren,The IPA symbols are indeed very cool.
71,8,Gretchen,"But if you do recognise them, then you get to be an insider. In the meantime, it would be useful for refreshing your memory of some of those rarer symbols you don't use as much."
71,9,Lauren,"Oh, like, maybe some kind of Scandi minimalist aesthetic."
71,10,Gretchen,To go with your nice Ikea furniture.
71,11,Lauren,"Okay, but seriously, I want this."
71,12,Gretchen,I also want this. I have another important question. What should we put our cool stylised IPA design on?
71,13,Lauren,"Hmm, I mean, in the long run, it could go on lots of things. Before we get ahead of ourselves, we need to run a special offer to offset the investment in getting this thing made. It's a little bit beyond our usual in-house design skills."
71,14,Gretchen,"That is very true. Also, it would be cool to use a special offer to make something available that we don't normally sell."
71,15,Lauren,This is finally our chance to make lens cloths.
71,16,Gretchen,"Okay, why lens cloths specifically?"
71,17,Lauren,"They're portable, and they're useful. They're practical. But you can also just lay your love of linguistics on something that you'd use anyway."
71,18,Gretchen,"Okay, so, this sounds really useful to you and me because we both wear glasses, but what about people who don't?"
71,19,Lauren,Phone screens get grubby. Computer screens get fingerprints all over them. People have sunglasses.
71,20,Gretchen,"I mean, this is fair. I got a lens cloth from a conference once. I actually use it all the time. Best conference swag ever. What if I could have a linguistics themed lens cloth and put it in all of my bags?"
71,21,Lauren,Exactly. Very much on the same principle as our linguistics-themed scarves. It's some stealth nerdery you can carry around with you and use.
71,22,Gretchen,"Here's the deal. Everybody who wants a stylised IPA chart themed lens cloth, we're gonna place one bulk order for them. This is your chance. Go to patreon/com/lingthusiasm. Join the Lingthusiast tier or higher by October 5th. Then we'll place the order on the 6th, so we know how many to get."
71,23,Lauren,"If you want several lens cloths, either to keep them in different places or to give as gifts or split with some friends, we have some options for those. We have pictures of the design."
71,24,Gretchen,It's extremely snazzy looking I have to say.
71,25,Lauren,That's all at patreon.com/lingthusiasm if you get in by the 5th of October 2022.
71,26,Gretchen,"Plus, patrons get all the usual perks like bonus episodes. Our most recent bonus was an introduction to a long-forgotten linguistics study about a rabbit."
71,27,Lauren,"If you need people to talk about your linguistic enthusiasm with or perhaps to admire your Lingthusiasm merch, patrons also get access to the Lingthusiasm discord."
71,28,Gretchen,"Thanks so much to everyone who's currently a patron. If you're already at that level, you will get a cloth in the mail. Look out for a survey from us for your address. [Music]"
71,29,Gretchen,"Okay, vocal fold demonstration. Let's start by putting our hands on our throats and saying some sounds."
71,30,Lauren,Okay.
71,31,Gretchen,/hhh/ /aaa/ /haa/.
71,32,Lauren,/haa/
71,33,Gretchen,/hah/ /hʌh/ /haa/ /hah/.
71,34,Lauren,/hʌh/ /haa/. Sounds like the most underwhelming laugh track ever.
71,35,Gretchen,The worst podcast. We're so funny.
71,36,Lauren,Very fake laugh there. I am just gently touching my throat low down on the front of my neck -- emphasis on the 'gently' there. I can still feel the vibrations even with just a tiny fingertip.
71,37,Gretchen,"When I've done this in intro linguistics class or intro phonetics class, which is a very classic classroom activity, some people seem to be really comfortable jabbing right at their voice box, and I'm like, 'Ooo, no, that's, ugh.'"
71,38,Lauren,I can report the same. I don't know if it's something to do with differences in anatomy or just twitchy reflexes but definitely a light touch for me.
71,39,Gretchen,"For the purposes of the demo, it doesn't matter. You can put your whole hand lightly at the base of your throat, which is what I do, or put a finger or two towards the middle. You can do it while you're talking normally as well, which I'm doing right now, but it's confusing if you're not making a very controlled sequence of sounds because you're also thinking about what you're saying, and that's kind of distracting."
71,40,Lauren,"/haa/ /hhh/. Yeah, great, here we are. If you're listening around people in public, then you're continuing the grand tradition of being slightly silly in public in the name of linguistics."
71,41,Gretchen,"If you really can't bear to do it now, do try out this demo sometime later when you've got a minute in a secluded location. Just put your hand to your throat. Make some repetitive sounds and feel what your throat's doing."
71,42,Lauren,"When I'm making a /hhh/ sound, my throat is doing nothing. But when I make an /aaa/ sound, there's a buzzing that's happening."
71,43,Gretchen,You can feel the vibration in a very cool '70s fashion. That buzzing is coming from your voice box -- also called your 'larynx' -- and specifically from the 'vocal folds' or 'vocal cords' that are inside that.
71,44,Lauren,"You might be able to feel a lump there if you've had a testosterone-based puberty. I can't. I don't imagine you can feel too much there unless you push down hard, which we've established is not necessary."
71,45,Gretchen,"Sometimes they're called 'vocal cords.' I think that's more common terminology because you can think of the cords as the strings on a guitar. Technically speaking, they're more flaps of muscle. Rather than being cords that are attached at either end, they're flaps that are attached all along one side."
71,46,Lauren,I'm so glad we don't call them 'vocal flaps.' 'Vocal folds' is fine by me.
71,47,Gretchen,"[Laughs] Gross. You can see videos of them. You can go on YouTube. We will link to a video of this. You can take a laryngoscope, which goes down your nose and has a little light, and you can see them flapping about and moving when someone's talking."
71,48,Lauren,"Look, your vocal folds are mucus membranes. You have a lot of saliva. Your vocal tract is quite lubricated. It's not a particularly appealing video if you find the inside of a mouth to be a lot. It's just that but more."
71,49,Gretchen,"They're really kind of gross. I think you get a full-body cringe rippling through the intro linguistics classroom when you put the video up. That's your warning. If you would like that or not like that, you can click on the link or not."
71,50,Lauren,"If the vocal tract is like a meat clarinet, then the vocal folds are that bit that's the reed that's making that vibration and making that noise happen."
71,51,Gretchen,"The clarinet is also not at all a disturbing metaphor. You say it very casually, which is because we came up with it a year or so ago for the Crash Course Linguistics phonetics video. You have the other stuff you do to change the shape of your mouth and your vocal tract to produce different sounds, which are like pressing the buttons on the clarinet. The vocal folds are the reed. Or you could think of this as like if you're playing a trumpet, and you need to make a buzzing with your lips into the trumpet, and that's sort of like what your vocal folds are doing. Again, you press the buttons and that affects what the sound is that comes out."
71,52,Lauren,"When you have laryngitis, that affects and enflames the vocal folds inside your larynx. That's why having laryngitis affects your ability to speak."
71,53,Gretchen,"I had laryngitis once when I was an undergrad, and it was the most exciting thing."
71,54,Lauren,"Why was it exciting, Gretchen?"
71,55,Gretchen,"Because I was midway through a linguistics degree, and I'd heard the thing about, 'Oh, you know, your vocal folds, your larynx, laryngitis, that's what it is.' And then I was like, 'It's true! I can't produce voicing. That's why I can only whisper because whispering is talking without voicing.' This also means that if you're in a public place, and you're trying to demonstrate this to yourself, and you're not getting the effect, maybe because you're whispering or doing it under your breath, which is you're not producing the exact thing that we're trying to study. This was something that happened to me when I was first reading books about linguistics, and they would say, oh, the difference between /θ/ and /ð/, as in 'thing' and 'then,' and I'd be sitting there trying to feel the difference, but of course, I was quietly in the library trying not to make any sounds, and so I couldn't feel the difference. I thought this was something wrong with me, but it turned out I was just not doing the thing."
71,56,Lauren,"Because voicing turns on and off throughout speech, it's why you feel a somewhat constant buzzing if you just hold your fingers to your throat while you're speaking. If you are only whispering, you're losing a whole dimension of information on sound. That's why if you play a game like broken telephone or pass it on where a group of people whisper a message in a chain, the reason that you're likely to get something very different at the end from the beginning is that the whisper is removing a whole bunch of cues that you're using to make sense of what's being said."
71,57,Gretchen,"Oh, that makes sense. You're really just trying to figure out what something means by context, like most of the time words are distinguishable in context. But if you start with a weird phrase, then it can degrade in the whisper because you're doing it -- I always thought it was just that, like, people have bad memory or something. Or whispering is quiet."
71,58,Lauren,"It is! Because whispering is quiet, and it removes voicing."
71,59,Gretchen,"Amazing. When we do vibrate our vocal folds, they're like an instrument and how like an oboe has a bigger reed than a clarinet, and it makes a deeper sound. Or a thicker string on a guitar is deeper than the thinner string on the guitar. Depending on the person, depending on how long and how thick your vocal cords are, you can have what shows up as a deeper or higher-pitched voice."
71,60,Lauren,A lot of what influences how large your larynx grows is whether or not you had a lot of testosterone in your puberty. That's one of the things that causes this growth to be more so in some people than other people.
71,61,Gretchen,"Right. If you didn't have a testosterone-based puberty initially, but you take testosterone later, your vocal folds will do that growth. It's effectively a second puberty."
71,62,Lauren,"We should say in general though that just like you don't arrange the parts in a choir by lining people up by height, there's not a direct correlation with how big you are and how big your vocal folds are and the pitch of your voice. There's lots of other factors that go into it as well."
71,63,Gretchen,"Some of that variation is also, individually, people choosing how low and how high to pitch their voices and also people making those sorts of decisions constrained by a culture. I remember I was in a phonetics class and learned that pre-pubescent kids in North America, who statistically all have the same vocal tract, still show gender differences in terms of their pitch because, socially speaking, the boys are more likely to choose to make their voices a bit deeper pitched than the girls for social reasons even though physiologically they don't have any reason to."
71,64,Lauren,"Fascinating. That's where it becomes as social thing not just an anatomical thing. There's been some studies with Japanese speakers as well in Japan where Japanese women have a higher pitch than American women, and Japanese men on average have a lower pitch than American men, so they sit even further apart in the range. That's a social thing around pitch that people learn as they learn to speak the language and live there."
71,65,Gretchen,There's also a lot of overlap in pitch range in the middle where just like there's hormonal factors that can influence how tall someone is and genetic factors that can influence how tall someone is but there's also a lot of overlap in terms of gender differences and height. It's not that all men are taller than all women or something like that.
71,66,Lauren,"That pitch has to do with how many times a second your vocal folds are vibrating. This can get measured by electroglottograph, which I like because it's an EGG or an 'egg.' It's a tiny little device that goes on your throat where your larynx is, and it creates a little electric circuit that gets closed every time your vocal folds pulse together."
71,67,Gretchen,"This is like a little electrode that gets stuck on with a sticky bandage patch on your throat, and you can measure that."
71,68,Lauren,Yeah.
71,69,Gretchen,If there's a part of me that's moving 100 to 200 times a second -- because that's what 'hertz' means -- why am I not more tired when I'm talking?
71,70,Lauren,It's because of the magic of the air pressure in your lungs that pushes up through your vocal folds. It takes a little bit of effort to get started but a bit like blowing a raspberry with your lips -- but even more so because your vocal folds are perfected for this kind of work.
71,71,Gretchen,"Also, my vocal folds are really jacked. Is that what we're saying?"
71,72,Lauren,"They are incredibly well specified for this work. Once they get started, that air pressure coming up from below lets them oscillate in a way that means you're not physically controlling each opening and closing. That's why you're not getting too tired but why it can be fatiguing to talk for a long stretch of time."
71,73,Gretchen,"I guess this is also similar to our musical instrument metaphor, right, because if I'm playing the clarinet, which I used to do in high school, I wasn't going there and actually physically vibrating the reed hundreds of times a second. I was directing a flow of air through it which would make the reed vibrate, which is similar to the vocal cords and similar to what happens when you're blowing air through your lips as well."
71,74,Lauren,And a reminder of just how much of this kind of acoustic phonetics and figuring out how the parts of the vocal tract work and produce sounds is very much a type of physics that's being studied.
71,75,Gretchen,Something that there's been a lot more work on the very fine-grained details of since recording technology has gotten a lot better.
71,76,Lauren,"You can manipulate the vocal folds to create different effects, and one of those effects is what we think of as falsetto."
71,77,Gretchen,"Falsetto, I think of it as like those clip things that you put on a guitar, like a capo, where if you clip it on the guitar, now every note on the guitar, you could play it the same way, they're all higher pitched. If you only use part of the vocal folds, then you're gonna produce this thing that's higher pitched."
71,78,Lauren,"Because you're only vibrating something that's smaller, and you can do that quicker."
71,79,Gretchen,"You know, Lauren, I've always wondered -- can I do falsetto? Am I doing falsetto? Why don't I get falsetto? You know, just because I didn't have a testosterone-based puberty, does this mean I don't get to do falsetto?"
71,80,Lauren,"You might not notice it as much because if someone who has a really deep voice does falsetto, it's much more noticeable but can take a bit of training. Most people should be able to do falsetto. It's just if you already have a relatively high pitch to start with, it's not as noticeable when you're doing a falsetto."
71,81,Gretchen,"Oh, okay. So, it's just that, if I did it, it would sound relatively similar to my regular voice, I guess. We've talked about the vocal folds as the thing that produces sound in general, but they're also very specifically involved with certain types of sounds. Demo time again?"
71,82,Lauren,I think so.
71,83,Gretchen,All right. Hands on your throats.
71,84,Lauren,Fingers gently to your throat.
71,85,Gretchen,We can do /sss/ /zzz/ /sszz/.
71,86,Lauren,/zzz/. This reminds me of our fricatives episode.
71,87,Gretchen,"Indeed, it does. And /fff/ /vvv/ /ffvv/ -- also from the fricatives episode."
71,88,Lauren,"Like, 'voiced.' That's convenient."
71,89,Gretchen,"V is voiced, yes. There're some pairs of sounds -- many of them are in English, some are also found in other languages -- where the difference between them is your mouth is in exactly the same shape, but your vocal folds are doing something different. In one case, they're vibrating. In the other case, they're just letting the air pass through."
71,90,Lauren,I can feel that -- which is very convenient.
71,91,Gretchen,"It's very neat. And you don't need a weird, gross laryngoscopy to do it. You could just feel the vibration on your throat."
71,92,Lauren,But this distinction isn't just in fricatives.
71,93,Gretchen,"No, there's also voicing stuff going on with various other sounds. We already looked at /aaa/ -- all the vowels are voiced. /aaa/ /iii/ /ooo/. You can try some vowels. They'll all be voiced."
71,94,Lauren,"So, we have voicing distinction in those fricatives, but we also have a voicing distinction in some other pairs of words like 'pat' and 'bat,' 'ten' and 'den,' 'cave' and 'gave.'"
71,95,Gretchen,"Yeah. If you're saying, 'pat' and 'bat,' again, your mouth part is doing the same thing. It's just there's something different going on in your vocal cords that's affecting what the meaning is. Same thing with 'ten' and 'den,' T and D -- the names of the letters -- 'cave' and 'gave.' Try saying this out loud and attracting some strange looks. With /sss/ and /zzz/, it's pretty easy to put your hand to your throat and feel a difference there because you can hold those sounds for a relatively long period of time. This is a problem when it comes to /p/ /b/ /t/ /d/ /k/ /g/. It's really hard to produce those sounds without a vowel after them. That vowel is gonna be voiced. And so, it's hard to feel what's going on before that because these sounds involve a complete closure of air and then releasing it. You stop up the air -- they get called 'stops' -- and you release it, and that makes it hard to feel contiguously what's going on in your throat because you have to release them into a vowel or into something."
71,96,Lauren,What's happening is a difference in how the vocal folds are vibrating. There's also another little thing that happens in English at the same time.
71,97,Gretchen,English also has this fun curve ball. I think we need a classic British comedy sketch to illustrate this curve ball.
71,98,Lauren,"Oh, if there is one, it's always very welcome."
71,99,Gretchen,"This is a comedy sketch by an old school British comedy duo called The Two Ronnies. I think they were two men, both named Ronnie -- hence the name. Basically, there's this laconic guy who comes into a shop, and he asks for 'four candles.'"
71,100,Lauren,"And the shopkeeper gets down behind the counter and pulls out one, two, three, four white candles. He's got him four candles."
71,101,Gretchen,"Ah, yes, you might think this is a reasonable response. But in fact, what the shop guy wanted was 'fork handles' -- as in handles for forks."
71,102,Lauren,"Handles for his forks, which sounds pretty much the same."
71,103,Gretchen,Right. What's actually going on is that words in English that begin with /p/ /t/ or /k/ get pronounced as if there's actually kind of an H there.
71,104,Lauren,Like in 'handles.'
71,105,Gretchen,"Like in 'handles.' So, 'fork handles' -- fork [pause] handles, I'm deliberately putting a break there -- and 'four candles,' there is that ghost of an H or a very short H in the regular English pronunciation of 'candles.'"
71,106,Lauren,It's like you wanna be very careful if your surname is 'Hook' to not call your son 'Michael.'
71,107,Gretchen,"Ah, because then you could say, 'Yes, this is my cook.'"
71,108,Lauren,"Ah, you have a private chef, Gretchen. That's very fancy."
71,109,Gretchen,"No, I just know this guy named 'Mike Hook.' This is an interesting type of distinction because it's not all of the time when you have a /p/ /t/ or /k/ sound that it has this ghost of an H attached to it. There's some contexts where you don't pronounce that H. One of those is after S. So, in a word like, 'sky,' you're probably not saying /skhaɪ/. It's just /skaɪ/. But this means that that K that's written as a K can be pronounced like a G would be in some contexts."
71,110,Lauren,Because my brain doesn't hear that puff of air and so is just as likely to think it's a G.
71,111,Gretchen,"Right. Have you ever heard the famous song that goes, 'Excuse me while I kiss this guy'?"
71,112,Lauren,"Yes, it's about making out with a man. No, wait, it's about making out with the thing in the heavens."
71,113,Gretchen,"So, the lyric is supposed to be, 'Excuse me while I kiss the sky.'"
71,114,Lauren,S-K-Y.
71,115,Gretchen,"But many people mishear it as, 'Excuse me while I kiss this guy.'"
71,116,Lauren,G-U-Y.
71,117,Gretchen,"Because in that context after an S, the K and the G really sound like they're doing the same thing. I think this is something that's really tricky for English speakers to wrap our heads around because our writing system is telling us to do this one thing, and yet it turns out that we're actually doing a different thing perceptually. And you've had however many years of your life minus a few at the beginning when you didn't know how to read yet telling you this is what this sound is. And then it's like, 'Ah, yeah, actually, no, it's something else going on.'"
71,118,Lauren,The good thing is you can observe this puff of air that comes out with a /p/ or a /t/ or a /k/. It doesn't come out with a /b/ or a /d/ or a /g/.
71,119,Gretchen,"This is, at least apocryphally -- I never had a phonetics class that did this -- but I've heard that some phonetics profs use fire to demonstrate this."
71,120,Lauren,"Because if you hold a candle or something up, you can see the air move."
71,121,Gretchen,"Yeah, if you hold a lit match or a candle up in front of your mouth while you're making /k/ /p/ /t/, you could blow out the candle."
71,122,Lauren,"I'm a little bit more risk-averse, and so I hold up a tissue. You see the same air moving with less of a risk of setting off the fire alarms."
71,123,Gretchen,"Look, I mean, I don't wanna make any promises. Don't try this at home in a dangerous location. Please have adult supervision, etc., etc. Exercise appropriate caution. But I just feel like it'd be fun to play with fire."
71,124,Lauren,"If you don't have live fire or a Kleenex to hand, you can just hold your hand in front of your face and feel that little puff of air that comes out when you say, 'pat' but not 'bat.' I think it's easy to see that this English split is not the only way to do things by looking at some other languages."
71,125,Gretchen,"Yeah, this was something that came up for me when I was learning French because French also has a two-way distinction on stops like /p/ and /t/ and /k/, but it doesn't have this extra puff of air which is called 'aspiration.' It just does the thing in your vocal cords the same way that /s/ and /z/ do."
71,126,Lauren,Okay.
71,127,Gretchen,"My favourite demonstration of this is there was a movie that came out in Canada probably a decade or so ago which is half in English, half in French, and the bilingualism is very much a feature of the movie. You know, strong linguist recommend. Watch it with subtitles in both languages and get a whole experience. The movie is called Bon Cop, Bad Cop."
71,128,Lauren,"Good cop, bad cop."
71,129,Gretchen,"Good cop, bad cop, but in French. But when I say this -- so 'cop' has been borrowed into French as a word there. When I say, 'cop,' in English, I'm producing it with that puff of air -- /kʰɑp/. But when I say it in French -- because I learned French young enough, I have a fairly decent French accent -- I'm not saying it with that extra puff of air. I'm saying, /bɑ̃ kɑp/, /bæd kʰɑp/. There's the same word, effectively, but because I'm pronouncing it according to each language's sound system because of the word in front of it, I'm giving it a different aspiration -- and also a different vowel sound but, you know, there's a lot that differentiates between accents."
71,130,Lauren,"In most languages that have this two-way distinction, you have one that's voiced and one that's not. But there's one sound in all of the set of stops that we have where you can't get a voiced version of it."
71,131,Gretchen,"Oh, is this a very special sound?"
71,132,Lauren,It is a very special sound. It's the glottal stop.
71,133,Gretchen,"Wait, your glottis is your voice box. That's your larynx."
71,134,Lauren,"Yes. So, to make a glottal stop, you have to close off your vocal folds, bring them together, which means that if you close them off, you can't also vibrate them to create the voiced version."
71,135,Gretchen,"You can't also push a stream of air through and have them vibrate through it. Yeah, I don't think that works."
71,136,Lauren,That's why you only ever get an unvoiced glottal stop.
71,137,Gretchen,"The glottal stop is the sound in 'uh-oh,' which is between the 'uh, oh.' You also often make it if you're lifting a heavy box or something, and you're just closing off your throat to make that tension. I think of it as sort of a grunt-y sound sometimes."
71,138,Lauren,"It is a sound in a whole bunch of different languages, including Hawaiian."
71,139,Gretchen,And in a few very specific contexts in English. The reason it's special?
71,140,Lauren,"Because we have a stylised version of it as the Lingthusiasm logo! We've discussed two-way distinctions between voiced and unvoiced in French and voiced and unvoiced aspirated in English, but it's possible to have more than two different distinctions because aspiration gives us that extra dimension to play with."
71,141,Gretchen,"Right. There are languages -- so English has a two-way distinction that has some fogginess around what's going on with whether aspiration is important depending on the position in the word. But some languages treat the -- so let me try to say this with my French brain -- /tʰ/ /t/ and /d/, each as three sounds. If you heard that as two T sounds plus a D or two D sounds plus a T, you might have English brain. But I was at least trying to produce them in three different ways. One of these languages that makes a three-way distinct is Thai. You can see in the name 'Thai' itself. That H there -- T-H-I -- is because it's pronounced with that extra puff of air, which is sort of a mini-H."
71,142,Lauren,"'Thai' is in the Tai language family, which is a T without the H -- unaspirated."
71,143,Gretchen,"Ah, very nice."
71,144,Lauren,Which is a set of distinctions we don't make in English. You might have an English speaker talk about Thai being in the /tʰɑɪ/ language family.
71,145,Gretchen,"Right. If you're not making that distinction. Another language that used to make this distinction was Ancient Greek. In Modern Greek, this has shifted. But if you've ever wondered why 'theta' and 'phi' and 'chi' -- or /kɑɪ/ -- are written with an H, it's because they used to be pronounced /tʰɛɪta/ and /kʰi/ and /pʰi/ contrasted with /tau/ and /pɑɪ/ and /kapa/. Then those sounds shifted in a later version of Greek. And so, these letter combinations -- the T-H and the P-H and the C-H -- became conventionalised in languages that were being influenced by the Latin alphabet as ways of writing the /θ/ /f/ and /k/ sounds."
71,146,Lauren,"It's definitely worth emphasising that these things aren't set in stone. As languages are spoken by newer generations, they can change. Apparently Korean has historically had a three-way distinction like we've seen Thai had a three-way distinction. But for younger speakers, it's moving towards a two-way distinction. It is possible to change."
71,147,Gretchen,"Yeah, change various things around."
71,148,Lauren,"If you've been struggling to hear distinctions that aren't in your native phonologies, that's totally understandable because the point at which voicing starts and how that differs across languages is measured in milliseconds. The fact that we perceive these differences at all in the languages we do speak is actually quite amazing."
71,149,Gretchen,"I think for me one of the things that helped make it click was -- and maybe this is a bi/multilingual experience -- but thinking it's not so much that I'm hearing aspiration, it's that this sounds to me like someone who's got a really English-y accent in French. If someone says -- uh, I dunno. What's a French phrase that a lot of English speakers kind of know?"
71,150,Lauren,'Qu'est-ce c'est.'
71,151,Gretchen,"Oh, boy, okay, yeah. That sounds like you have a really Anglo accent on that because you're saying, '/kʰɛs/-ce c'est' instead of '/kɛs/-ce c'est.'"
71,152,Lauren,Yeah. I think it's immediately apparent when I open my mouth that my French doesn't get much beyond café French.
71,153,Gretchen,"Right. That's a very good demonstration of Lauren doesn't speak French, isn't it?"
71,154,Lauren,"Yeah. I don't entirely know what it means, which is probably a good indicator."
71,155,Gretchen,"Oh, it's just, 'What is this,' or 'What is that?'"
71,156,Lauren,Ah.
71,157,Gretchen,"Or conversely, if you're someone who grew up speaking French or a language that doesn't do this extra puff of air that English does, that's one of the things that contributes to sounding like you have that particular accent when you're speaking English. It's comprehensible. I knew what you were trying to say. But it's something that contributes to that impression of having an accent that comes from a phonology that's arranged a little bit differently."
71,158,Lauren,"We've covered two-way voicing distinctions. We've covered three-way voicing distinctions. We've got an example of four-way voicing distinction if you want, Gretchen."
71,159,Gretchen,Amazing.
71,160,Lauren,"This is a voicing range that is pretty common across languages in the Indo-Aryan family. A lot of those are spoken in India -- Nepali as well, in Nepal -- a lot of languages that are from Sanskrit."
71,161,Gretchen,"So, this is things like Hindi, Assamese, Marathi. Lots of languages in that particular area have this four-way distinction. Let me think about the parameters here, right. You have your vocal folds are either on or off, buzzing or not buzzing, and you can multiply that by you produce this extra puff of air or you don't produce this extra puff of air."
71,162,Lauren,"Pretty much. I'll walk you through a minimal set in Hindi. Since I speak Nepali, I can sometimes approximate all of these. We'll see how we go. We have /tɑl/ ['beat'], /dɑl/ ['lentil'], /tʰɑl/ ['platter'], and /dʱɑɾ/ ['knife edge']."
71,163,Gretchen,"Okay. So, definitely my English brain thinks that several of those sound very similar, but I believe you that you're producing them differently."
71,164,Lauren,"And definitely not as well as someone who spent more of their life speaking a language with a four-way distinction, but we have our two voiced and our two unvoiced. One of our unvoiced is aspirated, and the other one uses what we call 'breathy voice.' It's voiced but the voicing has a little bit of a gap in it that creates this breathiness. Something like /dʱɑɾ/ or /bʱɑl/."
71,165,Gretchen,"Breathiness is something that I think you can also use in English for stylistic effect. Like, if I wanted to say, [breathily] 'Ah, how beautiful. How lovely,' I'm making the whole thing kind of breath-like or with that relaxedness of the vocal cords. But if I'm just doing it in this narrow context of on this particular sound /dʱ/, then that's making it for a particular contrast between one word and the next, whereas saying, [breathily] 'How beautiful,' it has a different emotional meaning or connotational meaning to saying, [without breathiness] 'How beautiful.'"
71,166,Lauren,There's none of that connotation when you're using breathy voice to create those consonants in Hindi or Nepali.
71,167,Gretchen,"Yeah. Not something like the difference between, in this particular set, 'beat' versus 'lentil' versus 'platter' versus 'knife edge,' which is just this very lexical meaning of here's a word that means something."
71,168,Lauren,"This breathy voice is contrasted with what we've just been calling 'voicing.' In phonetics, it gets called 'modal voice' because it's just your normal one, but they needed a technical term for it."
71,169,Gretchen,"Is this kind of like when you're doing statistics, and you have the mean and the median and the mode, and the mode is the one that occurs the most, so the modal voice is like, 'This is the one that most of the languages have somewhere, so we thought we'd call it, like, 'the common one.' It's just there.'"
71,170,Lauren,The default.
71,171,Gretchen,Are there any languages that make a five-way distinction?
71,172,Lauren,"Hmm, I don't know off the top of my head. There is a different kind of distinction that we can make where we have both breathy voice and modal voice, and we introduce a different voicing quality called 'creaky.'"
71,173,Gretchen,"There's a language called Jalapa Mazatec, which has creaky voice as one of its options. 'Creak' sort of sounds like /a̰/ /a̰/. It's this very relaxed vocal cords that means that the sound becomes lower because they're looser. It has this sound -- I think of it as kind of a Halloween-type sound, like if you're opening a door [imitates a creaky door sound] you might do it."
71,174,Lauren,"Just like with breathy voice, we associate it with more vibe related things."
71,175,Gretchen,Not to be confused with 'vibration.'
71,176,Lauren,"Whereas Jalapa Mazatec uses it as a way to distinguish vowels. It has five different vowels that all have either breathy, modal, or creaky in their pronunciation."
71,177,Gretchen,That's like 15 vowels if you multiply it out by the breathiness or the creakiness. That's great.
71,178,Lauren,"In total, yeah."
71,179,Gretchen,"'Creaky voice' is the technical linguistic term, but sometimes it shows up under the name 'vocal fry' when people are talking about it in English -- specifically for that stylistic effect. Some English speakers -- and I know I do this, if someone wants to go back and do an acoustic analysis of all the Lingthusiasm episodes -- do this at the end of a sentence, often, to lower your pitch of your voice towards the end of a sentence which finishes it."
71,180,Lauren,"It's a really good way to drop the pitch because, as you say, it's vibrating less because of that difference in the tension, and that allows you to really emphasise that you're either at the end of your turn or you're speaking with some amount of gravity or authority."
71,181,Gretchen,"I also tend to do it when I'm tired. If I'm just very relaxed and lying down after a long day, [creakily] 'Ah, I dunno. Just pass me a glass of water, okay.' I think that's got some creak or some fry."
71,182,Lauren,"I think the important thing with vocal fry is once you start actually noticing it and the acoustic features of it, you notice that it's done by a really wide range of people. It can be done by male radio hosts. It can be done by female podcasters. I can be done by Gretchen when she's tired. Pops up in all kinds of places."
71,183,Gretchen,"Vocal fry sometimes comes up in the media as here's this thing that they're criticising people, but it's just one of the many things you can do with your vocal folds, and all of them are fine."
71,184,Lauren,"I also find it very reassuring that in a study from five years ago, people under 40 find it a way of sounding authoritative."
71,185,Gretchen,"Oh, great! So, that's under 45 now. Eventually, all of the authoritative people will just be vocal frying."
71,186,Lauren,Doing interesting things with voicing.
71,187,Gretchen,I don't know about any languages with six distinctions. Maybe there are some that make even more. What's the minimum number of distinctions? We've got a lot of languages that do a two-way distinction in voicing.
71,188,Lauren,But there are also a lot of languages that have no distinction in voicing in terms of their fricatives and their stops that we've looked at so far.
71,189,Gretchen,"This is a lot of the Indigenous languages in the North American continent, Algonquian languages, most of the Iroquoian languages, except for apparently Wyandot, but Iroquois, Mohawk, Cree, Ojibwe, a bunch of these languages, sometimes sounds get produced with a little bit more vocal fold vibration. Sometimes they get produced without it. But that's a thing that you do depending on where it is in its position in the word or what your mood is at the moment as a speaker the same way that you could use breathiness or creak in English to convey a stylistic effect, but it doesn't change the meaning of the word. Voicing isn't important for changing the meaning of a word in those languages."
71,190,Lauren,"You also find it in South America a lot, across the languages of the Pacific and Southeast Asia and South China. Australian languages are phonetically famous for having this feature. In fact, on the World Atlas of Linguistic Structures map that we'll link to where you can see all these 'no voicing distinction' dots, only Murrinhpatha in Australia is a language that has a voicing distinction. The rest are all without."
71,191,Gretchen,Literally all of the other ones. I think Hawaiian and some languages like Maori also don't have a voicing distinction if you're talking about South Pacific languages.
71,192,Lauren,But it's something that's very common in Europe and Africa. I think that's why voicing is really baked into the design of the International Phonetic Alphabet.
71,193,Gretchen,"The International Phonetic Alphabet is ultimately based on the Latin alphabet and the Greek alphabet because that's the languages that the people who were making the first International Phonetic Alphabet were working from. They wanted to make it easy to type, for them, on existing typewriters which, you know, fair enough. So, we've got these pairs of symbols like P and B, S and Z, that represent this voicing distinction that sometimes get instantiated a little bit differently depending on the language, but you have this pair, whereas other things like breathiness or creak get represented by adding an extra little diacritic onto those sounds, which it's kind of interesting to think about an alt IPA where it got invented in Australia, and they were like, 'Yeah, voicing, I dunno. A few languages do that, but we don't know very many of them. Let's just use a diacritic for that as well.'"
71,194,Lauren,"Instead, where you have this voicing distinction, say, T and a D character, spatially, it's very meaningful on the IPA where the voiceless one is put on the left, and the voiced one is put on the right of the pair."
71,195,Gretchen,"And because ideally, I guess, if you were doing this chart with a voicing distinction as you have where in the mouth the sound is produced and what bits of the mouth are in contact with each other to produce it, then you'd wanna have a three-dimensional IPA chart to have the voiced one on top of the unvoiced one, like it pops out of the page, which I think we're not gonna make lens cloths of."
71,196,Lauren,No.
71,197,Gretchen,"The lens cloths will be in three dimensions, but the chart will be printed on them in the usual two dimensions of printing things."
71,198,Lauren,"Ah, yes. We are working with the same standard physical plane. And we kept that left side unvoiced/right side voiced pairing in our redesign of the IPA chart."
71,199,Gretchen,"But also, we put some circles to indicate the voiceless ones so that you can have that as a quick reference. I think the circles look cool."
71,200,Lauren,I think they look very neat as well.
71,201,Gretchen,"Because the usual IPA chart has a lot of text on it. It has labels for all the rows and columns. It has things like, 'When symbols occur in pairs, the left-most one represents a voiceless one.' This is, of course, very useful if you're new to the chart, but if you're looking for something that's more of an art object, that's a little bit useful as a reference thing. Maybe we could just use a fun circle, and if you know what a few of them mean, you can use the circle to remember the rest of them."
71,202,Lauren,You can see a picture of our redesigned IPA chart in the shownotes for this episode. The lens cloth offer is running until the 5th of October 2022.
71,203,Gretchen,"Please do, at some point, when you get a chance, put your hand to your throat and try out some voicing. It's really fun."

72,1,Gretchen,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics! I'm Gretchen McCulloch."
72,2,Lauren,"I'm Lauren Gawne. Today, we're getting enthusiastic about absurd, hypothetical linguistics questions. But first, our most recent bonus episode was a chat about the design of IPA charts and how the International Phonetic Alphabet is arranged."
72,3,Gretchen,"We talked to Lingthusiasm's resident artist, Lucy Maddox, about designing a different take on the IPA chart that is gonna be available for you on posters and lens cleaning cloths and various other items."
72,4,Lauren,"Those lens cleaning cloths are a special offer for our patrons, so head to patreon.com/lingthusiasm by October 5th to participate in that special offer. [Music]"
72,5,Lauren,"Gretchen, I've been reading What If? 2 by Randall Munroe, who does xkcd, and I'm delighted there are a couple of linguistics-related chapters in that book."
72,6,Gretchen,"There's this fun one about how long it would take to read all of the laws, which it seems like a massive task."
72,7,Lauren,Including a fun digression as to whether a Poké Ball is an egg.
72,8,Gretchen,This very much reminds me of the is-a-hotdog-a-sandwich type question.
72,9,Lauren,"Hmm, legal minds will debate, I'm sure. If only there was more linguistics content in that book, though."
72,10,Gretchen,"Well, you know, Lauren, as it happens, I have Randall Munroe right here. He has some linguistics questions to ask us as if we were starring characters in What If? 2."
72,11,Lauren,"Amazing. Welcome, Randall!"
72,12,Randall,"Hi! Thanks so much for having me on. I know I've met you, Gretchen, in the outside world, but it's really exciting to meet you here for real inside this podcast."
72,13,Gretchen,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm headquarters, as it were."
72,14,Lauren,We are delighted to answer your hypothetical linguistics questions.
72,15,Randall,"There're a lot of things that've confused me about language. English has some weird features. I was wondering, if I'm in a government hearing after this where they're questioning me, and if they ask me, 'Are you now or have you ever been a guest on Lingthusiasm?'--"
72,16,Gretchen,"To which you would have to answer, 'Yes,' at this point."
72,17,Randall,"Right. But my question is why the awkward repetition? Like, why does English make us specify whether the thing happened now or in the past? Why can't they just say, 'Are you/were you a guest on Lingthusiasm'?"
72,18,Gretchen,"I mean, there're definitely some languages that do things like this. In Chinese, for example, you don't have to specify the time in a statement. You can say the time, but you don't have to say it, which is one of the parameters on which language varies, but the specific legal question also has stuff going on in it."
72,19,Lauren,"It's partly because legalese is a technical variety of English, but it doesn't always just use technical vocabulary that makes it seem opaque. It also uses everyday words in a way that have really technical and specific meanings. Some of that is because legalese is about this process of building laws on top of each other and historically layering them. So, a word that has a really common meaning in general develops this really specific meaning in the legal context."
72,20,Gretchen,"I also think it's because lawyers have this very pedantic approach to language and looking at every single comma and potential for ambiguity. Because in realistic language we tolerate a lot of ambiguity, and we figure it out from context. But the whole thing with laws and trying to get it exactly on your side is not really allowing space for context and trying to pin everything down really precisely."
72,21,Randall,"Well, I was thinking about it. If I wanted to create that ambiguity -- like, if I wanted to ask, 'Are you in Nova Scotia now, or have you been there in the past?' -- how would I do that? I couldn't figure it out."
72,22,Gretchen,"I think in ordinary English you might just ask one version of the question -- 'Have you ever been to Nova Scotia?' 'Have you ever been on Lingthusiasm?' And then someone would just answer that with a 'Yes, in fact, I am there right now.'"
72,23,Lauren,We're trying to be helpful to each other in conversation in a way that law doesn't necessarily start from the same premise of being helpful. It's starting from the premise of being complete.
72,24,Gretchen,"And starting from the premise of being, actually, kind of antagonistic."
72,25,Lauren,Deliberately unhelpful.
72,26,Gretchen,It's like an adversarial approach to language rather than the cooperative approach we normally have.
72,27,Randall,That makes sense -- making it clear from context that you are asking about both the past and present even if you're only specifically referring to one of them.
72,28,Gretchen,"Yeah. Because if I say like, 'Have you ever been interested in linguistics?' 'Yes, I still am.' Like, it's still sort of true, but in this legal sense you might be like, 'No, it's not that I was before, it's that I am now.' It's just sort of trying to catch people out in being incredibly pedantic."
72,29,Randall,"If you wanted to add a way in English to make that explicitly ambiguous -- like if I wanted a way to say, 'You something something Lingthusiasm guest' -- is there a natural structure that you would add if you were in charge of revising English?"
72,30,Gretchen,"Well, I mean, one option you could do -- so English technically has only two tenses, past and non-past. Because you can say something like, 'Tomorrow I go to the airport, and I fly to this place.' So, you can use what's often called the 'present' to refer to future events. If non-past is the more versatile English tense, you could just make a special rule that's like, you don't change it. I think probably the most realistic English way would be to try to add an auxiliary. So, the future in English is often formed with 'will' or 'gonna.' You could have a new one of those. Like, 'Are you sort of Lingthusiasm guest?'"
72,31,Randall,"Or like, 'You ever a Lingthusiasm guest?' Yeah."
72,32,Gretchen,Yeah. You could maybe use 'ever' into -- like dropping the verb would help. Entirely. Or making some new version of 'would' or 'sort of' or something.
72,33,Lauren,"Just a new, tense-less version of English."
72,34,Gretchen,Just delete all the tenses in general.
72,35,Lauren,I feel like that would keep the lawyers even busier.
72,36,Randall,"I'm curious about the sounds of English. I know there're some sounds that are merging together, like the distinction between 'caught' and 'cot' in some dialects. Are there any sounds or phonemes that are currently in the process of coming into English or disappearing from it entirely?"
72,37,Lauren,"There's one that is disappearing and becoming a ghost before our very ears, which has millennia of history, which is what is known as the 'wine/whine' merger."
72,38,Gretchen,The /waɪn-hwaɪn/ merger.
72,39,Lauren,"That W-H /w/ that is pronounced by some older speakers or speakers of very fancy registers like RP as /hw/ -- so /hwɪt͡ʃ/, 'Having a bit of /hwaɪn/ over my /waɪn/.'"
72,40,Gretchen,"As you can hear from both me and Lauren, we both have the merger."
72,41,Lauren,"We have absolutely merged these. They are indistinct for us. /wɪt͡ʃ/ and /hwɪt͡ʃ/ is a very forced distinction I have to make. But for maybe, like, grandparent to great-grandparent generations at the moment, you do find it for some speakers which is a form of a sound that goes all the way back to Proto-Indo-European."
72,42,Randall,"Wow. It made it all this time, and now, we're the ones killing it off."
72,43,Lauren,We're killing it off right now.
72,44,Randall,Wow!
72,45,Gretchen,"It's kind of neat because in Proto-Indo-European, there was a /kw/ sound -- a sort of K-W -- which in modern Romance languages has become Q-U but still pronounced /kw/ or /k/. This is like in 'quando' or 'quoi' or some of these words you might know from French or Spanish or Italian. All these words that have K in it became H in the Germanic set of words. You get things like 'cornu-,' as in 'cornucopia,' became 'horn,' as in 'horn of plenty.' There's all these words that have a K sound -- which is sometimes written with a C, sometimes with a Q -- and those all became H. This is why we have all these words that begin with W-H -- 'Who, what, where, when, why' and the exceptional 'how.' Those are the same as the /kw/ words in those other languages because that K became an H. Then the H and the W swapped positions at some point because people decided they liked it better. Then, not quite the H stopped getting pronounced, but the H influenced the pronunciation of the W becoming /hw/ rather than -- I don't even know how you'd do it. Now, it's just sort of merged back with that W that we have -- /w/."
72,46,Lauren,"It's so widespread that the W-H set of question words in English are all /k/ words even in languages like Hindi and Nepali, which are over in the Indo-Aryan side of that language family. You get 'kina', 'ko,' 'kahile.'"
72,47,Randall,"Oh, so it's really old."
72,48,Gretchen,"That's why that H is there even though most people don't pronounce it. I think you're more likely to get sounds enter one variety of English, or disappear from one variety of English, and then that change spreads for a long time, and it takes a while to get to all of them."
72,49,Lauren,"You still occasionally find 'wine' and 'whine' as distinct, or more often, you find it distinct in Scotland, a lot of Ireland, and apparently older speakers in New Zealand have been slower than Australians and Canadians and Brits in dropping this."
72,50,Randall,"That makes sense. I know a few people who have that distinction, too, but like you said, it does tend to be older people. Although, I always find it funny. I always answered those dialect quizzes saying that I pronounced C-O-T and C-A-U-G-H-T the same. Then I was describing this merger to someone, and they said, 'No, you don't. Say it in a sentence.' I said it out loud, and I realised I am inside me. I didn't hear how it sounded from the outside."
72,51,Gretchen,Okay. Say the words.
72,52,Randall,"Like, 'I /kɑt/ him sleeping on the /kat/.' 'I /kɑt/ him sleeping on the /kat/.'"
72,53,Gretchen,"Oh, you absolutely say those differently."
72,54,Lauren,They are very different.
72,55,Gretchen,"I would say, 'I /kat/ him sleeping on the /kat/.'"
72,56,Randall,"I was born in that pocket of Pennsylvania where, when I looked on those dialect maps, that area is one of the unmerged areas."
72,57,Gretchen,"And all of these sorts of splits -- like dropped 'for whom' or added 'for whom.' Indian English has a bunch of retroflex sounds. All their Ts and Ds are produced with the tongue curled back onto the tip of the mouth. That's entered one variety of English, but it seems probably unlikely it will spread to all of the other varieties, but who knows."
72,58,Lauren,"One can hope. Because I would love to be able to distinguish between a retroflex and a non-retroflex. Too late for the plasticity of my phonemic inventory, but for future Englishes, it could be exciting."
72,59,Gretchen,They're cool sounds.
72,60,Randall,Can you practice the sound enough that you can convincingly convey it to other people who then learn it from you? And then it becomes natural for them?
72,61,Lauren,Deliberately raise a family of people who have these distinctions.
72,62,Gretchen,"I mean, I've always thought it would be cool to come up with some sort of, I dunno, conlang or something you could teach a kid or some sort of array of here's, like, three languages you could teach a kid that would give them the maximal number of phonemic distinctions based on those languages. Because Germanic languages actually have tons of vowels cross-linguistically. A lot of languages have five vowels or three vowels or maybe seven, and English has fourteen-ish, depending on the dialect. German, I think Norwegian, Dutch, also, all the Germanic languages have tons of vowels. It would be like, okay, you wanna include one Germanic language for the vowels, and then you want a language that has tons of consonants like maybe Ubykh."
72,63,Lauren,"Something around the Caucasus, for sure."
72,64,Gretchen,"Something around the Caucasus for consonants. And then maybe a language with lots of tones -- like Cantonese has more tones than Mandarin, so maybe give them Cantonese so they get tone. Then you have this nice array of this will make it easier for you to learn any other language because you've got most of the major sound distinctions."
72,65,Lauren,"It's also really good because you also have a really good spread of a language that's isolating and doesn't have a lot of morphology through to one with middling -- English is very underwhelmingly average -- and then those Caucasian languages do tend to have really good morphology, so it would be typologically satisfying on multiple fronts."
72,66,Gretchen,"Yeah. So, raise your kid to be Cantonese-Ubykh-English trilingual, and they'll be all set for their future language learning."
72,67,Lauren,[Laughs] I think we've said everything un-useful to say about that question.
72,68,Gretchen,[Laughs]
72,69,Randall,"Say we're playing a game. I'm gonna pick a random North American English speaker and ask them a spoken or written usage question. Like, 'How would you say this?' 'How do you pronounce this?' 'How do you write this?' Now, you get to pick someone else to ask them same question to without knowing what it's gonna be. If your person gives the same answer as my person, then you win. Now, who would you pick if you wanted the best chance of matching a random person? Would you pick, like, a news anchor, a kid, or a nondescript middle-aged person, or like a writer or something?"
72,70,Lauren,"I think I have an answer. Gretchen, who would you pick?"
72,71,Gretchen,"I think this is really complicated because I wanna know what's the spoken or written usage question that you're asking them because I think it would depend what are the parameters this varies on. Because if it's an age-based usage question that I'm asking, then I wanna pick based on age, but if maybe it's geography that's more relevant or urban status -- I think you'd probably want somebody in a mid-sized city because language change tends to happen faster in urban centres and slower in rural areas. You wanna split the difference. But not one of the mid-sized cities that has distinctive stuff going on. Like, Pittsburgh has got a whole bunch of stuff that's been documented for it. So, yeah, I'm like, what are you gonna do for gender? I guess you sort of want somebody who's around the middle for a lot of statistics, sort of middling in age -- not too old, not too young -- middling in terms of city. I dunno. Lauren, do you have a more specific answer?"
72,72,Lauren,"Oh, yeah, I'd pick a lexicographer. [Laughter]"
72,73,Randall,And you'd tell them what the game is?
72,74,Lauren,"Well, I think because of all of the people who have to think about and understand language usage, I always find lexicographers have a really solid appreciation for what is in the mind of the average language user. They'd be the first group of people that come to mind for me. I guess we want someone who's at the intersection of being a lexicographer and all of those demographic details that Gretchen was suggesting."
72,75,Gretchen,"I mean, I think that's probably Kory Stamper, right, because she's one of the youngest lexicographers. But 'young' for lexicographer is like, I dunno, probably 40s. I think she lives in a mid-size American city."
72,76,Lauren,"Okay, our answer is Kory Stamper. Done."
72,77,Gretchen,There we go.
72,78,Randall,"Nice. You know, Gretchen, I realised as you were answering that, there was a project in a Midwestern newspaper ran a contest to try to find the most average person in the country. They did exactly the procedure you're describing where they picked a city that was the most mid-size that was in the middle on a whole bunch of variables, and then they had the town vote on who the most representative average person in the town was. They picked this one guy. He owned a hat store, I think. Then they were like, 'We found America's average man.' Then they took him around to show him a bunch of stuff and get the average man's opinion on this and that."
72,79,Gretchen,Sort of proto-Joe-the-plumber experience.
72,80,Lauren,It must be really good to track down the most average person because they must be a wealth of marketing insights.
72,81,Gretchen,"Well, I was also trying to answer the question for gender because you can sort of pick an average age, you can pick an average location, but for gender, I do actually think that there might be benefits in choosing a non-binary person, not necessarily because non-binary is the average of men and women, but there was a really interesting study by Chantal Gratton on how non-binary people talk in different types of circumstances and how they can adopt features that are associated with multiple genders from that axis. I think, again, if we're looking for versatility, which is a reason for picking a lexicographer."
72,82,Lauren,If you're a non-binary person working in lexicography --
72,83,Gretchen,We wanna hear from you.
72,84,Lauren,We've got a great game to play.
72,85,Gretchen,[Laughs]
72,86,Randall,"So, if I say, 'It's 3:00 p.m. and hot out,' what is 'it' in that sentence? Because the more I think about it, the more it hurts my head."
72,87,Gretchen,"That's a fun question because this 'it' is doing something that's, as you may have noticed, semantically meaningless. That's not the same thing as 'I ate it,' where 'it' refers to maybe some cake, maybe an apple, a physical object that you can point to. The 'it' in 'It's 3:00 p.m.,' 'It's hot,' 'It's raining' is just there because English really hates it when sentences don't have a subject -- like a real, physical subject that's there that you've said even if it doesn't mean anything. English is not okay with that."
72,88,Lauren,"There's lots of languages that will happily say something that would translate into English literally as 'Is 3:00 p.m. Is hot.' Or 'Is 3:00 p.m. and hot.' And therefore, there's no 'it' there. Because it's not there for its meaning, it's just there to fill this spot in a sentence, it doesn't matter that it is filling the role for being 3:00 p.m. and hot. 'It' is just there to tick a box. In fact, this is so odd in English and such a quirk of English that it has a name which is 'dummy it.'"
72,89,Randall,"So, wait. You could attach that 'it' both to the '3:00 p.m.' and to another verb. I could say, 'It's 3:00 p.m. and was eaten.'"
72,90,Gretchen,I don't think you can. [Laughter] Do you think that's grammatical?
72,91,Randall,What just got eaten?
72,92,Gretchen,'It's 3:00 p.m. and eaten' is like a Lewis Carroll story or something.
72,93,Lauren,"The 'it' being eaten is suddenly meaningful, and so it can't coordinate as an empty dummy it and a meaningful-subject it."
72,94,Gretchen,"I think that's actually a nice test because you can say, 'It's 3:00 p.m. and hot and raining,' and all of those are doing the same 'it.' But when you start combining them -- I mean, I guess if you say, 'It's hot and eaten,' now you're just referring to a specific item and not the general state of affairs. Some people think the 'it' in 'It's hot' or 'It's raining' refers to the weather or the sky. But we don't generally go around saying, 'The sky is raining.'"
72,95,Randall,"Well, now I'm gonna start."
72,96,Gretchen,"I mean, you can change things."
72,97,Lauren,"'It's raining' is an interesting construction across languages because a lot of languages require you to say something like, 'Rain is raining' or 'Water is raining.' They don't have that dummy construction. They've solved it in a different way."
72,98,Gretchen,I should say this is the dummy as in a dressmaker's dummy or like a mannequin in a store window. It's just propping up the clothes. You can think of this 'it' as propping up the rest of the sentence.
72,99,Lauren,"I also like to think of it as because English is so stressed about not having a subject, like a distressed baby, it needs a pacifier, and that's why you give it a dummy."
72,100,Randall,Then I think 'It's 3:00 p.m. and eaten' is gonna stress out English just a little too much.
72,101,Gretchen,"Yeah. If you want another piece of technical vocabulary, this construction like, 'It's 3:00 p.m. and eaten,' is known as zeugma. This is something like, 'She put out the light and the cat.'"
72,102,Randall,"Oh, I like that."
72,103,Lauren,"You like it, but the lawyers would be having a meltdown."
72,104,Gretchen,"Let's see if there are any other fun examples. 'You held your breath and the door for me.' 'I took the podium and my second trophy of the evening.' 'The boy swallowed milk and kisses.' You can use it for multiple functions. But I think normally when zeugma works, it's -- I mean, you can do it in the abstract like 'Put out the light and the cat' because one's a figurative use and one's a physical use. But I think, yeah, 'It's 3:00 p.m. and eaten' I have trouble with. It's definitely deliberately playful. I don't even know if it's even ungrammatical. It's deliberately playful."
72,105,Lauren,'What's afternoon tea?' 'It's 3:00 p.m. and eaten.'
72,106,Randall,"Yeah, it seems like there's an omitted 'at,' like, 'It's at 3:00 p.m. and ready.'"
72,107,Lauren,"It's because 'ready' is definitely more of an adjective, whereas 'eaten' is a more nominalised-but-still-verb."
72,108,Gretchen,"Yeah, I think 'It's at 3:00 p.m.' -- that can refer to, like, the event is at 3:00 p.m. That's changing it into a literal 'it' again."
72,109,Randall,"Well, and the reason I couldn't say, 'It's 3:00 p.m., and I'm eating it,' is then you're like, 'It's a different 'it'.'"
72,110,Gretchen,"Yeah, each of them has its own subject, so that's fine."
72,111,Randall,"Yeah, and it's like, 'Oh, you didn't say what he's eating, but he's eating it,' you know."
72,112,Gretchen,Yeah.
72,113,Randall,"So, as I understand it, you can use the International Phonetic Alphabet to transcribe all the sounds that people use in language."
72,114,Lauren,Mm-hmm.
72,115,Randall,"How you do you write a cough in IPA? I was looking through the chart, and I couldn't figure out, is there a symbol that would go with that sound?"
72,116,Lauren,"A general, full-throated cough is not something that is specifically a speech sound in any human language, so there's not a --"
72,117,Gretchen,That we know of yet.
72,118,Lauren,"That we know of yet or that someone has not created to raise their child to attempt to turn it into normal phonology. So, we don't have a specific symbol for a cough in the standard International Phonetic Alphabet as set forward by the International Phonetic Association."
72,119,Gretchen,"However, you have now unlocked -- congratulations -- the extended IPA."
72,120,Randall,I've never heard of the extended IPA.
72,121,Gretchen,I don't think we've ever talked about it on an episode.
72,122,Lauren,"Oh, how excellent!"
72,123,Gretchen,This is yet more IPA for your fun and enjoyment.
72,124,Lauren,"Also, for useful technical reasons."
72,125,Gretchen,"Also, useful technical reasons."
72,126,Randall,Are you allowed to tell everyone about this? Or is this a secret held among linguists?
72,127,Gretchen,The classic IPA is devised for linguists to talk about sounds that are in the regular speech repertoire of spoken languages. The extended IPA is generally used by speech pathologists to transcribe other sounds that people sometimes make when they're learning to or producing speech differently from how the typical user of their language does it.
72,128,Lauren,Speech pathology covers a really wide range. It could be anything from working with children who have lisps and stutters through to helping people post-stroke or with aphasia regain the ability to speak.
72,129,Gretchen,"Some sounds -- the one that's really memorable for me is that they have gnashing of teeth in extIPA and also smacking lips and other types of whistled version of S, which I'm not gonna demonstrate because a.) I don't think I can, and b.) it might be kind of painful if you're on headphones. There's also some sounds in extIPA that are, I think, very difficult to pronounce unless you have a cleft palate because they're bringing the air through the palate in your mouth where most people don't have a hole there or through your nose and mouth at the same time, if you have a cleft palate. That's where I would look if I was looking for coughing because it seems like the kind of thing they might have done."
72,130,Randall,"Okay. Do they have a whole new set of symbols, or is it mostly the Latin letters turned upside-down and stuff?"
72,131,Lauren,There's a lot of Latin letters turned upside-down or back-to-front. Or sometimes they'll use something from the IPA with some additional diacritics and decoration.
72,132,Gretchen,"Yeah, it's a lot of diacritics. Like, things above and below the original letters. Unfortunately, it's very unglamourous having hyped up the extIPA. There's a whole section for unidentified or indeterminate sounds, which are a bunch of symbols in a circle. So, if you're not sure what consonant is said, you can write C in a circle, which is kind of neat. But cough is written as -- do you wanna get a pencil and write this down?"
72,133,Randall,Okay.
72,134,Gretchen,"Open bracket, open bracket, 'cough,' close bracket, close bracket. [Laughter]"
72,135,Randall,All right. I guess we've already got a way to write that.
72,136,Gretchen,I wish there was some sort of more interesting symbol. But there is this whole thing. They use music notation for loud speech and soft speech. They have 'forte' and 'pianissimo' and these sorts of things.
72,137,Lauren,"This is outside of the extIPA, but if you want a linguist-approved convention for writing laughter in a conversation analysis, they use the @ sign."
72,138,Gretchen,"Oh, that's true."
72,139,Lauren,I do have a handful of friends who will text me with '@@@' instead of 'lol.'
72,140,Gretchen,Amazing.
72,141,Lauren,It's handy.
72,142,Randall,"That reminds me of a comics problem which is, as far as I know, there's no good written onomatopoeia or sound effect for the sound of applause. So, if you wanna show applause offscreen -- off-panel in a comic -- if there was an explosion, you would write, 'boom,' you know."
72,143,Gretchen,Or 'bang' or something.
72,144,Randall,"There're sounds for splashing -- like 'psh.' But there's nothing for the sound of applauding. I don't even know how to suggest it. Usually what cartoonists do is cheat, and they'll write, 'woo,' to imply people cheering."
72,145,Lauren,"As someone who studies language and gesture, I don't think that's cheating. I think that's cooping the multimodality of human expression to advantage in a graphic novel format."
72,146,Randall,"The other thing you'll sometimes see is people will just write, 'clap clap clap clap.' So, it's not cheating. It's, you know, one of the many ways you can use language. But I feel like it would be so helpful if there were some way to write that sound. Since you're both linguists, can you make one? [Gretchen laughs] How would you represent that? Like, okay, if '@@@' is laughing?"
72,147,Lauren,Representing a sound as a conventionalised spoken form is onomatopoeia. Some languages do this kind of thing far more frequently and more conventionally than English does. We might want to take a look at a language that does that. I think Japanese is one of those languages that has a lot of ideophones and onomatopoeia.
72,148,Gretchen,"Japanese does this a ton. The Japanese ideophone, onomatopoeia, for clapping is 'pachi pachi.'"
72,149,Randall,'Pachi pachi.' That seems about right.
72,150,Gretchen,"Yeah, it seems about right. But the fun thing is also that 'pachi' can also refer to the number eight in Japanese, which is more commonly 'hachi,' but it can also be 'pachi.' If you're texting or you're on social media, and you wanna indicate applause or clapping, you can also write a bunch of eights. At least Japanese speakers will know what you mean by that. I mean, I guess there's also the emoji these days. People do that as well."
72,151,Lauren,"The emoji does have those little action lines. But to get those action lines into English, we just made a big deal about Japanese having this onomatopoeic form, but I think 'clap' is also a form of onomatopoeia. We just don't look at it that way."
72,152,Randall,"Huh, 'clap.'"
72,153,Gretchen,"Oh, no, wait. So, the etymology of 'clap.'"
72,154,Randall,I've never been on tenterhooks waiting for an Etymonline definition.
72,155,Gretchen,"Yeah. So, the Etymonline entry for 'clap' has 'a common Germanic echoic verb,' which is also found in Old Frisian, Old High German, Old Saxon 'klapunga,' and it -- yeah, 'unknown origin, probably onomatopoeic.'"
72,156,Lauren,"I think the obvious thing to do is to put 'clap clap clap,' footnote, down the bottom of the comic, because good comics should have footnotes, you just link to the Etymonline entry. Everyone's happy. [Laughter]"
72,157,Randall,"Yes, oh man."
72,158,Gretchen,The answer was inside you all along.
72,159,Randall,"It's like you start saying 'clap' so fast that you stumble over the sounds, and there you've got it."
72,160,Gretchen,"From a physical, articulatory perspective, you're sort of doing a teeny-tiny clap with your tongue, inside your mouth, against the rest of your mouth."
72,161,Randall,"Yeah. I mean, because, well, the /k/ is the clapping at the back, and then the /p/ is the front, and the /l/ is the labiodental --"
72,162,Gretchen,It's a lateral.
72,163,Lauren,Your whole mouth is clapping.
72,164,Randall,Yeah.
72,165,Gretchen,Three or four different parts of your tongue are all doing little taps against the roof of your mouth.
72,166,Randall,Your whole mouth is applauding. That is so cool. Okay. Thank you for that.
72,167,Gretchen,You're very welcome.
72,168,Randall,"This might be almost a question for a singer, but you mentioned these sounds that are outside the speech register. What's up with the piercing sound of a horror movie scream? Is that falsetto? Is that a normal speech sound but louder? Or is that your throat doing something weird?"
72,169,Gretchen,"There's a great paper about screaming, which is brilliantly titled, 'Human Screams Occupy a Privileged Niche in the Communication Soundscape,' which I think begins to answer your question. It suggests that screams are universal and acoustically unique so that they'll alert us to danger and ensure, and I quote, 'biological and ultimately social efficiency.' I guess the hope being that, like, if someone's screaming, even if you don't speak their language, you can still tell this is a human distress signal. We normally write a scream from an onomatopoeia perspective as 'Aaahhhhhh!' with a lot of As and maybe Hs because /a/ is the most open of the vowels. The Jaw is just fully dropped. It's the least restricted. If you tried to scream something like, 'Eeeeeee!', you'd have to have your mouth be a lot more closed."
72,170,Randall,"Yeah, you never write I-I-I-I-I."
72,171,Lauren,"I guess that's why the /i/ in 'shriek' is trying to -- because it's closed, but it also then tends to correlate with perceptually higher-pitched things. That's trying to give you that perception of it being really high-pitched, which /a/ doesn't necessarily do."
72,172,Lauren,"Yes. Because some comics will do A-I-E-E-E-E-E, like 'Aieeeee!'"
72,173,Lauren,Trying to get the best of both.
72,174,Gretchen,"Yeah. Trying to give the high-pitched-ness of it. The other thing about this paper is that it says that screams are 'acoustically well segregated from other communication signals,' as in, they're higher-pitched than other communication signals, and that this is also partly to avoid false alarms. Because, like, imagine if a third of your words just had the scream bit in them, and then you'd kind of be like the 'boy who cries wolf' of like, 'Oh, well, if you're screaming all the time, nothing's ever urgent.'"
72,175,Randall,You know what. There are a few animals that make sounds that I think are in that scream register because people get freaked out by them. I think foxes and then elk do a weird noise.
72,176,Gretchen,"There's some animals that make sounds like crying babies, which I dunno if that's also in the same range, but the scream cluster is in 30-150 Hz. So, animals -- probably some of them are in that range, and you could measure that. And that there's also a perceptual attribute called 'roughness' that screams tend to have. I really don't wanna demonstrate a scream and really freak people out listening to the podcast, but if you think about your latest horror movie scream style, it's got this sort of back-and-forth modulation, that sort of roughness."
72,177,Randall,"I'm curious -- it was interesting to realise that I learned from you about how emojis, a lot of them represent gestures, and how some of them are things we have words for, but some of them aren't. What are some gestures that people do without realising this is a type of communication or without having a word for it?"
72,178,Lauren,"I'm gonna tell you the answer. But once I do, you will never unsee this. I just have to prepare you for that fact. There is something that everyone who gestures does all the time. It has a specific technical name. That is the repetition in a gesture to indicate duration or emphasis. This kind of repetition is known as a 'beat' gesture. You will absolutely see it in the most clearest manifestation if you watch a politician give a speech because they love to use them to give a sense of coherence to what they're saying. It's this magic thing. If you're giving a speech, here's a pro tip. You can use beat gestures. If you continue to use the same repetition on your stressed syllables -- I'm doing it now, but you can't see it."
72,179,Gretchen,"Lauren, I feel like you're really emphasising the beat gestures in a very auditory way."
72,180,Lauren,"I'm emphasising the beat gestures auditorily. But if you continue to do this gesture repetition, you can actually give the sense that everything you're saying alongside those gestures is the same topic or it's coherent even though it may not actually be so."
72,181,Randall,"Huh. So, this is like when you're shaking your hand up and down as you talk, and the up and down motion goes with the syllables, and then suddenly, when you do that, I have this urge to vote for you."
72,182,Gretchen,Vote for Lauren. She can't be beat.
72,183,Lauren,"[Laughs] There's my slogan. So, you can combine it with a thumbs up if you wanna be like, 'That was a really great job,' or a pointing gesture. It combines with other gestures. That's part of why you see it everywhere. But sometimes, a person's hands won't be indicating, like, a pointing gesture, or they won't be giving any information about the size or the shape of something. They're just doing this repetition. The analogy in emoji is that we use a lot of repetition in our emoji to do the same kind of emphasis or duration -- so a string of clapping hands to show applause in emoji or a string of hearts to say, 'I really love that idea.'"
72,184,Randall,"Is it true that if you make someone hold their hands still when they're talking, they're less coherent or have a harder time forming sentences? I feel like I heard that somewhere."
72,185,Lauren,"The general suggestion is yes. I think we've talked about it before, and I've said that's the case. I've been returning to this literature and will probably revisit it in an episode, but it turns out that there is a lot of variation in what people mean when they say that they've stopped people from gesturing. And so, there's a lot of variation in just how much it really does change how people speak. Possibly, sometimes it's just because they come up with these really fantastically bizarre experiments."
72,186,Gretchen,"There's some where they tie them down so they can't gesture, right. Maybe being tied down is a bit distracting."
72,187,Lauren,"Oh, yeah, there are some fascinating study designs."
72,188,Randall,"I mean, any time you have to have anyone do anything in an MRI, their circumstances are not gonna be natural. Well, what you really need to do is just raise someone in, like, have all the furniture in their house to be shaped like an MRI."
72,189,Gretchen,And then they'd be totally comfortable with it.
72,190,Randall,"So, they go to sleep, and it's in an MRI. And their couch where they watch TV is an MRI."
72,191,Lauren,Adding it to my long list of study design ideas that are terrible. A lot in this area are fascinatingly bad.
72,192,Randall,"So, a lot of the time, I'll read fiction or watch a movie where there's a fictional language. If I come across a sample of a language, and I'm trying to figure out, 'Is this a real, natural human language, or is it something that was created by a language enthusiast to seem real,' if you were hired as detectives to try to figure it out, what do you look for? What would be the hallmarks of an invented language?"
72,193,Gretchen,This sounds like a great linguist job.
72,194,Randall,"What would be the hallmarks that give away, you know, it's someone who's trying to make it seem like a natural language. If you were trying to figure out if you're looking at a real language or one by someone who's trying to fool you, what would you look for?"
72,195,Lauren,"I would go straight to trying to find the irregularities. If there are no irregularities, that's an immediate sign that you have something that is too neat to have been slowly evolved collectively as a communal agreement by a collection of speakers."
72,196,Gretchen,"Especially if there're some people who do this and some people that do that. Because one of the things with artificial languages is they'll tend to make one language. But as we were talking about with 'wine' and 'whine,' or trying to find the averagest English speaker, everyone's slightly different with the language. If you don't have any of that representation of 'Different people are doing this slightly differently, and we don't fully know exactly how all of this stuff works, but here's a bunch of ways that it could be' --"
72,197,Lauren,"I think I would go, probably, straight to the pronoun system or how they do copulas -- so in English 'is, are, be, am' are all copula verbs, but they're all a bit of a hot mess because, over time, we've created this really unbalanced paradigm. Or we've taken two different verbs and turned them into the past and the present of the current one. Or with pronouns -- we just borrowed 'they' from one of the Scandinavian languages, and you can't actually find a robust explanation for where 'she' came from in the English paradigm. 'I' and 'me' are incredibly ill-balanced. If you have a completely neat, like, 'I have all these pronouns, and they're perfectly clear which one is 'me' and which one is 'you' and which one's single and which one's plural,' I'm like, ugh, that is suspiciously regular. And language is very good at being irregular in these high-use areas."
72,198,Gretchen,"It's like a house that no one lives in because it's suspiciously tidy. I think also the high-use areas, like in a house that you live in, tend to have more irregularity going on. I think it's the difference between a stair rail or something that's been polished by generations of people walking by it and having their hand on it. Some areas will be smoother than others. It's hard to get that patina of use without lots of people doing it."
72,199,Lauren,"I find the best way to do that when I'm constructing languages for fictional worlds is just to bring a degree of absentmindedness to my work. I might just generate the pronoun paradigm twice, and then take the bits I like of both of them, but then randomly forget sometime and use another form so there's one completely irregular one in there."
72,200,Randall,"That makes sense. Now and then I see people complain about like, 'Oh, this show is unrealistic because the characters pronounce this one character's name two different ways.' Like in Star Wars, some of them say /han/ Solo and some of them say /hæn/ Solo. 'That's because they haven't prepared well enough.'"
72,201,Lauren,It's just two different parts of the galaxy.
72,202,Randall,Yeah.
72,203,Gretchen,As somebody named Lauren /gan/ -- or as you say it --
72,204,Lauren,Lauren /gɑn/.
72,205,Gretchen,Yes. People never pronounce real people's names differently depending on their accent.
72,206,Lauren,People would never have a /gɑn/gan/ merger. That would be completely unrealistic for my co-host to use the incorrect vowel in pronouncing my name.
72,207,Gretchen,Because I don't have your /gɑn/ vowel.
72,208,Lauren,"So, yeah, that kind of irregularity. I do have to say, sometimes there is implausible irregularity. In Game of Thrones, I found it comedically implausible that every single member of Arya Stark's family would pronounce her first name differently. But I can totally believe there is an entire galaxy where there are two different ways to pronounce /hɑn/ or /hæn/."
72,209,Randall,"So, it's like the difference between there being, oh, a couple of different accents -- some people say this name this way, some people say /hɑn/, some people say /hæn/ -- versus, like, these people have clearly not met Arya because they all say it differently."
72,210,Lauren,Her own family members don't seem to know.
72,211,Gretchen,"And the reasons are often motivated in some sort of factor. If you have characters -- okay, people who are in this group do this; people who are in that group do this -- but like, why do these characters who all grew up together in the same environment, why do they talk so differently if they all grew up together? Maybe there's some sort of other reason, right? But what sort of factors are influencing how people are talking differently or like, 'Oh, we just happened to hire a bunch of actors from different places. Whatever.' Sometimes, you get a show that does that sort of accent neutral casting or accent indifferent casting, but if you wanna create within-world story reasons for people -- you know, 'Oh, we're gonna give all the good guys British accents.'"
72,212,Lauren,"Yeah, a bit of randomness and whimsy definitely helps bring a language to life."
72,213,Randall,"That's a really clever thing to look for. It's nice to know that you could just be a little bit less fastidious and actually make it seem more real. Let's just suppose, optimistically, that this podcast recording survives for 50 or 100 years. I always think it's funny. We're sitting here recording this at a specific time and place, but it's gonna be listened to in the future. And we don't actually know how far in the future. People will listen when it's posted, but then it'll sit around. I thought it would be fun, keeping in mind those people 50 or 100 years in the future that if we try to make guesses about features of English that seem unusual to us but will seem like normal usage to the listeners in 2072 or 2122, we could make our guesses about what we think usage is gonna look like. And then, in 100 years, the listeners can grade us on who got closest to correct. It's like a contest. We wouldn't get our scores for 100 years."
72,214,Gretchen,"Please, if you're listening to this in 100 years, you know, maybe human life expectancy will have gone up, and we'll still be around."
72,215,Randall,Be sure to post this episode on the 'intergalactic hollow-sphere.'
72,216,Gretchen,Share it with your friends via your brain implant. Okay.
72,217,Randall,"Don't forget to like, subscribe, and merge the podcast with your consciousness at the 'galactic core.' [Laughter]"
72,218,Gretchen,"I actually have a suggestion that might even work on a shorter timeframe. We might be around in, say, 20 years or 30 years to hear the answers to some of these, which would be kind of exciting. One of the fastest changing areas of language is that there's a new word for 'cool' about every decade or so -- sometimes less. I was writing another article where I had to project the future of English, and I thought, you know, if we go back, and we look at a list of words for 'cool,' do they have any sort of features in common so we could predict what the new, cool word for 'cool' might be? Some words for 'cool' that may not be cool anymore, things like, 'sick,' 'hot,' 'lit,' 'rad,' 'sweet,' 'tight,' 'nice,' 'neat.' There's also another subset like --"
72,219,Randall,'Keen.'
72,220,Gretchen,"'Keen,' 'nifty,' 'groovy.' Apart from 'nifty' and 'groovy,' which both have this /i/ sound at the end, all of these other words are very consonant-vowel-consonant from a pronunciation perspective. Sometimes with an extra consonant at the beginning or end. Sometimes, there's two. Like, 'sick,' 'lit,' 'rad,' 'sweet,' 'nice,' 'neat,' they've all got these bookended consonants on either side. If we can come up with some other words that are monosyllables with consonants on either side, maybe one of these words will eventually turn into the word for 'cool.' This would be the first time that I've ever been cool in my life. We can come up with some of them. I think the current word that 'the kids' are using these days is 'based,' which is the opposite of 'cringe.' It's like 'based in fact,' sometimes used meta-ironically. Attributed to the rapper Lil B. I'm getting this from Urban Dictionary because, again, I don't think we're particularly cool here. I came up with some additional candidates. If you wish to contribute any, you also can, of words that have the right phonetic form that could turn into a word for 'cool' maybe. But maybe there are more. They don't have to mean something that sounds good, right. Because 'sick' or something doesn't sound good."
72,221,Lauren,"Okay, what have you got?"
72,222,Gretchen,"So, 'sop' seems like it's got potential. 'Numb.' I dunno, I just feel like 'numb' could mean 'cool.' 'Left.' I dunno, maybe it's kind of 'out from left field' or sort of bizarre. As a left-handed person, I kind of like this one."
72,223,Lauren,"I was gonna say, I feel like this is your left-handed affirmation coming through here."
72,224,Gretchen,"Thank you. 'Sunk.' I dunno, 'sunk' could mean 'cool.' These have got some good acoustics to them."
72,225,Randall,"Oh, getting a new meaning for, like, the sunk cost fallacy becomes the sunk cost positive thing."
72,226,Gretchen,"Yeah. Like, 'Wow! That's so sunk, man. I can't believe it.'"
72,227,Lauren,"I have a very long bow to draw here. I don't think I'm gonna win with this. But I would like to propose 'whale,' as in the ocean-going mammal, because there are some people who still pronounce that as /hwɛɪl/, and then I'll have a really obvious token to check if we fully reduce the wine/whine merger."
72,228,Gretchen,'/hwaʊ/ that's so /hwɛɪl/ of you!'
72,229,Lauren,I just wanna make sure we have a lot of tokens for something that has a W-H pronunciation for some people to make sure that we've definitely closed that merger. Or it's been de-merged.
72,230,Gretchen,"Hmm. I mean, some people are using the Beowulf 'hwaet' ironically now."
72,231,Lauren,"Oh, yeah, maybe we could get that going."
72,232,Gretchen,Bring some of this stuff back.
72,233,Randall,"Or, hey, this can be my opening. If America has finished merging 'caught' and 'cot,' then we could bring back 'caught' to mean 'cool.'"
72,234,Gretchen,"Oh, yeah, 'That's so cot of you.'"
72,235,Randall,"No, no, no, you got to unmerge it."
72,236,Gretchen,'That's so /kɑt/ of you.'
72,237,Randall,"You know, the weird thing is when you're describing this, you're using the word 'cool' a lot. It strikes me that that word has hung on for a weirdly long time and means the same thing. There're all these other synonyms that come and go, but that one -- like, when I read old newspapers going back at least five or six decades -- has basically the same connotation."
72,238,Gretchen,"It's interesting that 'cool' retains its meaning as the meta-term for this category, whereas if I say something's 'groovy' now, I'm implying it's dated. I'm not saying it's still cool. I mean, like, I dunno if there're gonna be more temperature words. I think that mine has been pretty much exhausted. I mean, unless you're gonna start saying something's 'warm.' Like, 'cool,' 'chill,' 'hot.'"
72,239,Randall,"'Tepid, man.'"
72,240,Gretchen,I think that's the wrong phonetic profile.
72,241,Lauren,"Actually, 'luke' fits. And it's now only in the context of 'lukewarm.'"
72,242,Gretchen,"Yeah, 'That's so luke.'"
72,243,Lauren,Sorry Lukes out there.
72,244,Randall,"I mean, if you're going for the phonetic profile, I think 'damp' fits."
72,245,Gretchen,"'That's so damp, man.'"
72,246,Randall,"No, wait, no, because, I mean, that's very similar to 'dank.'"
72,247,Gretchen,"That's very similar to 'dank,' yeah. 'Dank' is already there."
72,248,Lauren,The things people can semantically shift when they set their minds to it are truly astounding.
72,249,Gretchen,"You really can't predict what's gonna be in cool, but they do seem to have some sort of phonetic signature. If any of these words that we've mentioned turn into a word for 'cool,' I definitely didn't see 'based' coming, so who knows."
72,250,Lauren,That would be very 'whale.'
72,251,Gretchen,We get bragging rights. That would be very 'whale.'
72,252,Randall,"That was real 'tepid' of you. Well, to put my stake in the ground, my prediction -- when I was a little kid, you could tell if someone learned from reading because they would pronounce certain words ways that -- like they'd say /dɛbɹɪs/ instead of /dɛbɹi/ because they hadn't heard someone say it. They had read it. I feel like we're conducting so much written communication now, I wonder if more of those will just become alternate, accepted pronunciations. So, like /dɛbɹɪs/, /fəkɛɪd/ instead of 'façade.'"
72,253,Gretchen,If you were me when I was a kid saying /sɛntɹɪfjʊgl̩/ instead of /sɛntɹɪfɪkl̩/.
72,254,Randall,Exactly. 'Grand /fɪnal/.'
72,255,Gretchen,There's one that's already there which is 'forte.'
72,256,Randall,"Oh, yeah, I only just learned that I've been saying that one wrong."
72,257,Lauren,What would be a 'non-forte' pronunciation of 'forte'?
72,258,Gretchen,"/foɹt/, I think, right, because it's originally Italian. In Italian, it's both spelled 'forte' and pronounced 'forte,' but a lot of people write it with an accent mark as if it was French, like 'café' -- or 'resumé,' which gets written with the accent mark. You can understand why you'd wanna do this because the E there isn't silent, but it's not actually originally a French word."
72,259,Randall,Yes.
72,260,Gretchen,"Yeah, I like that we had this pronunciation argument. This makes me feel much cooler than coming up with for words for 'cool.'"
72,261,Randall,Mispronunciation is my 'forté.'
72,262,Lauren,"I guess if you're listening to this in 100 years from when it was released, email/contact @lingthusiasm to let us know which of us is closest. [Laughter] [Music]"

72,266,Randall,Stay lingthusiastic! [Music]
73,1,Lauren,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics! I'm Lauren Gawne."
73,2,Gretchen,"I'm Gretchen McCulloch. Today, we're getting enthusiastic about mapping languages in space. But first, we're heading into our anniversary month."
73,3,Lauren,"November is Lingthusiasm's anniversary month, and it's been six years this year."
73,4,Gretchen,"Wow! The podcast is so big! In celebration of our anniversary, we'd like to get you to share a link to your favourite episode or share your enthusiasm for linguistics and for Lingthusiasm. Most people still find podcasts through word of mouth, and a lot of them don't yet realise they could be having a fun linguistics chat in their ears every month."
73,5,Lauren,"Or eyes. All Lingthusiasm episodes have transcripts, too."
73,6,Gretchen,They do. We're asking you to help connect us with people who'd be totally into a linguistics podcast if only they knew it existed.
73,7,Lauren,This is a bit of an anniversary tradition for us. We always see it in the stats that all of your recommendations really do help people find the show.
73,8,Gretchen,"If you want to share Lingthusiasm on social media and tag us so we can see it and like it and so on. If you share in private, we won't know about it, but you can feel a warm glow of satisfaction. Feel free to tell us about sharing it in private on social media if you want us to see it, and thank you, and interact."
73,9,Lauren,We are also doing a listener survey for the first time. It's your chance to tell us what you're enjoying about Lingthusiasm so far and what else we could be doing in the future.
73,10,Gretchen,"This is your chance to suggest topics, as well as give us other kinds of comments and feedback."
73,11,Lauren,"Also, we couldn't resist the opportunity to add a few linguistics experiments in there as well, which we'll be sharing the results of after the survey. We might even write up a paper about the survey one day. We've got ethics board approval from La Trobe University to do the survey."
73,12,Gretchen,Always fun to have your day job coming in with Lingthusiasm.
73,13,Lauren,"Yeah, it's been nice to bring the two together for this. To do the survey or to read more details about it, go to bit.ly/lingthusiasmsurvey22 or follow the link from our website and social media."
73,14,Gretchen,"Also, our stylish, minimal, reimagined IPA chart is now available as a poster. Thank you to our patrons for funding our stretch goal to fit the design into poster-rectangle shape in addition to the square shape on the lens cloths. For IPA posters and other Lingthusiasm merch, which makes a great gift, head to lingthusiasm.com/merch."
73,15,Lauren,"Our most recent bonus episode was a chat with Liz McCullough, Lingthusiasm's former production manager."
73,16,Gretchen,Liz and I chat about how doing science communication relates to linguistics from Liz's other former job at a science museum as well as non-academic careers related to linguistics more generally.
73,17,Lauren,"To listen to this episode and all of our other bonus episodes, go to patreon.com/lingthusiasm. [Music]"
73,18,Gretchen,"I have a brilliant travel idea that, as far as I know, people aren't doing yet."
73,19,Lauren,Okay.
73,20,Gretchen,You know how you can go on architectural tours of places or historical tours? What if you could go on language tours?
73,21,Lauren,"Ah, sign me up. That sounds great."
73,22,Gretchen,Right? You could just have a local guy tell you about all the different language things that are going on in a particular area.
73,23,Lauren,"I would love to take a train from Southern Italy, move through Italy hearing the dialect change until you get up to the north. Then by the time you're in Northern Italy, that's got more happening that's similar to French. Then you move through French, and then you move through the southern varieties of French like Occitan. That has more in common with languages like Catalan in Spain. Then as you move through Spain, you can move through Valencian, Manchegan. You could stop for the cheese as well as the dialect. Eventually, you'd move through Spain, and you'd get to Portugal. You'd just be slowing moving through slowly changing languages. It would be delightful. Sign me up for that one."
73,24,Gretchen,"Well, as much as I love trains -- and I think this sounds like a great idea -- I just think you're gonna miss so much that way. We need to do a walking tour, maybe like a bike or a horse, so you could really stop at all the little villages on the way and find out what was going on."
73,25,Lauren,Sounds even better.
73,26,Gretchen,"There was actually this guy. Edmond Edmont, who was a Frenchman, who did a -- you could say -- biking tour of French dialects."
73,27,Lauren,Could he be our tour guide?
73,28,Gretchen,"Sadly, he's dead."
73,29,Lauren,Okay.
73,30,Gretchen,"He was doing this like 100 years ago. At the very end of the 19th Century, he spent four years biking around France, talking to locals, cataloguing their unique words and phrases. He went to over 600 towns and gathered materials for what would become the Atlas linguistique de la France-- the French linguistic atlas -- which was one of the first things in this genre of what's going on in different places. This is just France, right. If we wanna do this level of detail around the world, we're gonna be doing this for 100 years."
73,31,Lauren,"Look, I think it sounds like a worthwhile endeavour."
73,32,Gretchen,"You know, just uproot your life. It's fun."
73,33,Lauren,We would need a lot of local tour guides for sure.
73,34,Gretchen,"We'd also need to understand a lot about things like local history and what has come into making the languages different. Because Edmond Edmont was just keeping track of unique words and phrases but not trying to figure out why these things were going on. Like, I'm curious about why. You know, was there an empire here? Was there a war? An invasion? Marriages? Nation state building? Migration? Centralised education? Telecommunication? There's so much going on that influences what people are making in terms of linguistic decisions in a particular area."
73,35,Lauren,"Especially in countries where some of those layers have been things like colonisation or dispossession of large groups of people. History can be pretty heavy, and don't wanna underplay that at all, but it is important to understand how these things have influenced the shape of the languages in a given area."
73,36,Gretchen,"And it's something that goes on if you zoom in on any area where humans have been living. There's always something linguistically interesting there. We picked this very Southern European/Mediterranean vacation, but you could do this anywhere and say, 'What's happened here? What are the histories and the linguistic things that have gone into making what people are doing today?'"
73,37,Lauren,Where are we going next on this tour?
73,38,Gretchen,"Well, somewhere else that's really interesting when it comes to how languages exist along sort of a pathway or a continuum is up in the north in Greenland and the Arctic Circle, Northern Canada."
73,39,Lauren,I've never been there before. This is very exciting.
73,40,Gretchen,"I technically haven't been there either, but I learned a bit about it in Canadian history class. One of the things it's linguistically famous for, the varieties of the Inuit language, which are spoken by the people up there, is that it's a whole continuum where from one village to the next or from one area to the next, there's all these small differences that add up into if you pick two places that are relatively far apart, people can't necessarily understand each other, whereas any two places that are relatively close together, oh, yeah, that's sort of close enough, and you can figure your way out through."
73,41,Lauren,"I know there are four major dialect groups. So, at some point, people must find a way to group these into larger dialects, but on the ground, the situation isn't actually as clear cut, it sounds."
73,42,Gretchen,"You have four groupings. You can see how these are related to modern day geopolitical groups as well because you have the Alaskan Inupiaq, the Western Canadian Inuktun, Eastern Canadian Inuktun, and Greenlandic Kalaallisut. You can see how the Alaskan grouping versus the Greenlandic grouping are, to some degree, modern day political entities in addition to all of these groups being cousins of each other as you go along the coast of the Arctic Ocean."
73,43,Lauren,"If we were to pack up the sled dogs, or maybe get some kayaks, and head into that Kalaallisut-speaking area, you can see how they are all similar, but there are differences as you move through the chain. As you move geographically from one side to the other, you have, in the west, the word for 'eye' is 'isi,' and as you move further east, it becomes 'ili,' and then further along, right up in the north, you get 'ihi.' You can hear that the consonant in the middle there is changing in its pronunciation as you move through. It's not just for the word 'eye.'"
73,44,Gretchen,"This is 'eye' as in the body part, yeah?"
73,45,Lauren,"'Eye' as in the body part -- E-Y-E. If you speak a variety that has that S there, that's systematic in words that have that."
73,46,Gretchen,"So, there's gonna be a whole bunch of words that have the S where a little bit further east they might have the L, and further east from that, they might have the H."
73,47,Lauren,"Yeah. It's a systematic set of changes, which means if you are used to hearing people from a neighbouring variety, you might be used to understanding what the systematic changes are. But as you move further along, it might get harder for you to understand what's happening in someone else's variety."
73,48,Gretchen,"This sometimes comes up when it comes to the name of a language. Sometimes, people in Canada talk about the 'Inuit language' or the 'Inuit languages,' depending on whether you're more of a lumper or a splitter. Sometimes, people talk about 'Inuktitut' versus 'Inutitut' because there's one variety in the northern part of Quebec where they don't say the K before the T in that context. You can see it in the names of the language. There's these subtle differences that go across the area. But it still sounds like it's the same word, so there's been some efforts in teacher training in Iqaluit, which is the capital of Nunavut, to figure out, okay, how can we train teachers from different communities. Then they can go back and teach their own community's variety to people in that community, which is what they want, but also have the benefit of doing a certain amount of centralised training as well. It's figuring out how much centrality are you gonna do; how much standardisation are you gonna do; what types of media and resources are people gonna encounter in a particular area."
73,49,Lauren,"Across history, there have definitely been periods where people have found it to their advantage to see themselves as one group or one language with people who speak similar varieties. And there have been points in history where even small differences have been used to declare that these are very different languages spoken by very different groups of people. It's always worth remembering that that is as much a political decision -- often more of a political decision -- than it is a linguistic decision. It seems like that Inuktitut education programme is trying to balance those two competing things."
73,50,Gretchen,"Right. To go back to France for a sec, one of the reasons why it feels like -- at least if you're somebody who's learning French as a foreign language -- that there is this one French that people learn is because the Paris-based government went to a lot of effort to try to stamp out regional variation in French. But regional variation is the natural state for languages to exist. The idea that everybody in what's defined as a 'nation' should speak exactly the same way is something that people in governments decide, less so that people who are on the ground who just want to be able to talk to their neighbours are doing in any area."
73,51,Lauren,"I guess one of the challenges for our tour is to not get distracted by the fact that geographic variation isn't the only variation we have in any place you might expect variation between people of different ages. There might be gender-based differences, which I'm sure a good tour guide would point out to us without letting us get too distracted given that geographic variation is our focus on this tour, but it's not the only type of variation we have, for sure."
73,52,Gretchen,"Especially in larger population areas, you may have things that are based on social class or the districts that people live in but also which groups tend to interact with each other more."
73,53,Lauren,"We could take tours on any scale. We've gone across the north of Canada and across Greenland, but if we're ready to commit to some serious air miles, I would love to take you on a tour of the BANZSL language family."
73,54,Gretchen,"Ooo, 'BANZSL,' that sounds fun."
73,55,Lauren,It's an acronym that stands for 'British Australian New Zealand and South African Sign Languages.' It's a sign language family that spans the countries that are named in it as well as a few others. They're all related to each other.
73,56,Gretchen,"This seems like it makes sense as part of the British Commonwealth. They're probably influenced by schools for the d/Deaf with respect to each other, and then also maybe diverged locally in the particular local context that they were in. Interestingly, despite Canada being a Commonwealth nation, we used to have what was called 'Maritime Sign Language,' which I don't think is super prevalent anymore, but in the eastern part of Canada, for a while, there was a part of the BANZSL group that was Maritime Sign Language. These days in Canada, mostly you get ASL, which is technically American Sign Language, and some LSQ, which is Langue des signes québécoise. These are both related to French Sign Language because the first American school for the d/Deaf came into existence right after the American Revolution."
73,57,Lauren,I don't imagine they wanted some British people turning up and introducing their sign language there somehow.
73,58,Gretchen,"Not particularly, no. They had a few people come over from a school for the d/Deaf in France and exchange information about sign languages that way which is why ASL and FSL are more closely related than the BANZSL group."
73,59,Lauren,"Again, the distribution of language is telling you a lot about European history, American history, Commonwealth history. Even with documented time depth of around 300 years for this language family, there is a lot of variation, especially in the lexical level -- that word level -- between these different varieties within the family."
73,60,Gretchen,"That's this very large-scale, geographic variation depending on ships and planes to get from one group to another. There's also some really small-scale variation. For example, the Faroe Islands, which are these pretty tiny islands in the North Atlantic sort of equidistant between the top of Scotland, Iceland, and the edge of Norway."
73,61,Lauren,Right. Right in the middle of the Northern Ocean.
73,62,Gretchen,"At least if you're defining 'middle' based on these three countries. These islands are pretty small. They speak Faroese there. It's related to Icelandic. They're both descended from Old Norse. There were Vikings and so on going around these areas. Even within Faroese, which is the language that's spoken on a relatively small number of relatively small islands, there are differences in how people use Faroese depending on whether you're in the more northern islands, whether you're midway down, part-way down, or all the way to the more southern islands. There's five different vowel changes that happen in a continuum along this band of islands from north to south."
73,63,Lauren,"What you see as you move down this long string of islands is that people in the north will have more features in common with people who are further north. As you move further down, there are more features that change. By the time you get from the north to the south, there are five or six different sound changes that have taken place across the language. It's gonna be more changes that you have to keep track of to try and understand what someone's saying, whereas your neighbours on the island next to you in the north might just have a little bit of an accent difference."
73,64,Gretchen,
73,65,Gretchen,"Right. So far these differences have been coming from the fact that the varieties in these regions have a common ancestor, which linguists refer to as a dialect chain or dialect continuum. But there's also a thing where languages that come from different roots, but are all existing in an overlapping area, start picking up features from their neighbours and getting influenced by each other. So, some examples of this are in the Indian subcontinent, you have the Indic languages like Hindi and the Dravidian languages like Tamil influencing each other. Or in Southeast Asia, there are similar tone systems shared between four different language families, Sinitic, Hmong-Mien, Tai-Kadai languages, and Mon-Khmer like Vietnamese. The Balkans are also another famous example of this. And this kind of similarity is referred to as a linguistic area or, if we want the technical name, a 'Sprachbund'"
73,66,Lauren,A German word.
73,67,Gretchen,"A nice German word. I've always thought of it as meaning -- so I think the literal cognates in English would be 'speech band,' and so sort of thinking of a band of different ways of speaking going from, say, red to blue with lots of shades of purple in between. But this also makes me think of a very obscure analogy which is -- you know what else goes in regions along an area and is characteristic of a particular region?"
73,68,Lauren,Mm-hmm.
73,69,Gretchen,"You know, it's not only languages. Sometimes, it's food."
73,70,Lauren,"True. I mean, a food tour is a thing that people do already that they could just improve by adding language."
73,71,Gretchen,"A language and food tour -- amazing! But you could talk about, maybe there's, like, a Mediterranean style of food where you have feta and olives and cucumber and things like this in a particular area, and it's not necessarily only characteristic of one area."
73,72,Lauren,Like a culinary region.
73,73,Gretchen,"Right. In that case, is the culinary equivalent of a Sprachbund maybe a 'Schmeckbund'?"
73,74,Lauren,Amazing.
73,75,Gretchen,"[Laughs] I don't think 'Schmeckbund' is gonna catch on because it relies on people knowing this not incredibly prevalent linguistics concept, but I want it to catch on."
73,76,Lauren,Maybe we could make a Sprachbund cake to celebrate our holiday.
73,77,Gretchen,"Ooo, a 'Sprachbundt' cake."
73,78,Lauren,I believe it is etymologically related as well.
73,79,Gretchen,I guess they're all related to 'band' and 'bind.' Where does this word come from? It sounds German to me.
73,80,Lauren,"It does sound German, and it's definitely German. As a non-German speaker, you tend to find anglicisations are something like /spɹækbʌnd/. But it was coined by Nikolai Trubetzkoy, who was a Russian. In fact, he originally came up with the term in Russian as 'yazykovoy soyuz,' language union.' It's the same 'soyuz' that pops up in the Russian form of the phrase 'Soviet Union.'"
73,81,Gretchen,"Oh, of course. Okay."
73,82,Lauren,"He used that in a 1923 paper. I think the Soviet Union was formed in 1922, so unions were clearly on his mind. Then he presented his research in a paper in 1928 in German, and so he had to use the German form. It's the German version that has stuck."
73,83,Gretchen,"Okay, so this is German 'Bund' meaning more like 'federation.' Like, the 'Bundestag,' which is something in German national politics."
73,84,Lauren,"Yeah. He calqued it from Russian into German to give this German conference paper, and then the idea really took off in German, and it has stayed German even for English speakers."
73,85,Gretchen,"Fascinating. I guess 'language federation' doesn't quite have the same ring to it as 'Sprachbund,' and 'speech band' isn't actually the same thing."
73,86,Lauren,It's much catchier.
73,87,Gretchen,It's nice -- we often get our technical terminology from Latin or Greek -- to have some terminology showing up in German via a Russian guy.
73,88,Lauren,It makes a nice change.
73,89,Gretchen,"Sprachbunds are the natural state for languages to exist in unless you have an empire or a capital city or some sort of authority saying, 'No, you must speak exactly this thing.'"
73,90,Lauren,Cities really weird up language.
73,91,Gretchen,"Cities, they're weird. This is the village state of languages. But also, if you try to make a map of languages -- and this is kind of difficult -- you don't just see, like, here's a whole bunch of bands. You also see groups and clusters and some places where the number of languages are more dense than other places."
73,92,Lauren,"Indeed, yeah. One thing that people often note is that some features of the environment seem to be more conducive to there being a lot of languages maybe spoken by smaller groups of people. We know that a language can happily be sustained with a speaker population of 4- or 500 people, maybe even fewer, if they are in a context where the language can keep being spoken. A lot of the places that tends to happen are in hilly or mountainous areas or places on islands. This is the highlands and islands theory of where you get intense linguistic diversity."
73,93,Gretchen,"I guess this makes sense because the water between islands is a bit of a barrier to people getting by. I mean, you have boats, but it's a little bit harder than just walking across a field. And also, mountains, they're pretty hard to climb."
73,94,Lauren,"You really have to wanna go see your neighbours, for sure."
73,95,Gretchen,"Yeah. So, if those things make it a little bit harder to interact with your neighbours, then your language is more likely to be a bit more distinct from people that are far away from you by a geographic barrier not just distance."
73,96,Lauren,"This is definitely the version I was taught when I was a student. A lot of the newer work has focused less on those geographic features and more on the feature of whether the climate can sustain a large number of small groups because if you're not competing aggressively for resources, it allows you all to maintain your small speaker population. So, I think some of the more recent research has looked at that. But again, that's a geographic feature that's influencing just how many languages you might find in an area."
73,97,Gretchen,"I know you find this with Indigenous languages of North America where there's a lot more density of even unrelated languages on the west coast in both Canada and the US because the climate is very lush and flourishing, and you just need one valley for your group, and you're fine. You don't need to be going out and trading with as many people or interacting with people as much, whereas on the eastern side, you have larger areas of language groups or related languages."
73,98,Lauren,"Similarly, in West Africa, when you move out of the Sahara area into that more verdant belt, you definitely get a much higher density of different languages there."
73,99,Gretchen,Nice.
73,100,Lauren,All lovely places that are worth adding to our tour.
73,101,Gretchen,"This is a thing -- the geography and the physical geography -- can also sometimes get overridden by historical factors. If there was an empire, if there was a religion going through saying, 'Here's what people need to speak. We're trying to impose or enforce a particular language,' that can be a thing that influences what language people are speaking as much as, 'Okay, we're able to sustain ourselves in this one valley.'"
73,102,Lauren,"I've definitely talked before about how we actually find it hard to pin down the number of languages that were spoken in Australia before colonisation because so many of those languages were erased by the process of white people coming in and changing the social landscape. There had been really long, long sustained multilingualism and people speaking their own languages in their own communities for so long that there were probably many more languages that weren't even made record of."
73,103,Gretchen,"The erasing part of history is one reason why counting can be really hard and also who's doing the counting and what are they trying to figure out. Sometimes, this is a 'Are you a lumper, or are you a splitter?', but also, do you have a nation building agenda that says, 'Oh, we wanna assume that everyone in this nation actually speaks the same language.' Maybe there are a bunch of different people who can't actually understand each other when they talk, but we're gonna say we all speak the same language, and just a bunch of them aren't really doing it very well, and they need to speak like the capital. Or are we gonna say, you know, it's true that we can understand this other nation state next door, but we're still gonna say that it's a different language from there is because ours is the one that we speak in our nation state, and theirs is the one they speak in their nation state. There's lots of agendas that come with trying to say, 'Is this a labelled language, or is this something that isn't worth labelling?'"
73,104,Lauren,"Even with all these factors, people have been very interested in counting and coming up with a definitive number of languages even though that is a challenging and incredibly slippery number."
73,105,Gretchen,How many languages were you told there were when you were in school?
73,106,Lauren,"I think we were talking about there being 6,000 languages. That was definitely a number that carried through the early '90s through the early 2000s."
73,107,Gretchen,"I feel like I was maybe told 6,500."
73,108,Lauren,"These days, a lot of people say 7,000 as their rounded off number."
73,109,Gretchen,"These numbers are suspiciously round because -- 'Oh, 7,031.' I think the suspicious roundness is useful to keep in mind because any more precision than that is very artificial because we don't quite know where the boundaries between two things are. Or sometimes those boundaries are constructed without reference to people on the ground."
73,110,Lauren,"Also, thinking about who has done the most work in terms of quantifying the number of languages in the world, a lot of that work has come out of missionaries who are trying to figure out how many languages they should be translating the Bible into for their missionary work."
73,111,Gretchen,"Right. Which is a whole agenda that might not actually be in consultation with the people who speak those languages in the first place -- whether they were asked if they wanted a Bible. But where does this incentive come from -- who's funding all of these boats and horses and bicycles and things that are -- if you want to have a single, unified count, you need a lot of transportation. Sometimes, that funding comes from people who wanna donate to evangelise their religion. But even if you have academics counting, which you might think is a little bit less interference, that's still some funding agency, which is probably a national government somewhere, or maybe a non-profit, or a wealthy person who says, 'Okay, I want you to go do some research.' It's still somebody external coming in and trying to help create this external count because the idea of a local count doesn't mesh with trying to count the whole world."
73,112,Lauren,"It's definitely more enticing to the academic linguist to say, 'I am documenting this language' and not 'I'm documenting a dialect of a language.' There's certainly a prestige to the concept of 'a language' that is at play there as well."
73,113,Gretchen,"Also, for individuals who are speakers or signers of that language to be able to say, 'Oh, ours has a different name from those people over there because we never got along with them, and we wanna call ourselves something different.' This can be a political decision at multiple levels."
73,114,Lauren,"Even when you account for how much is known about the world's linguistic diversity, there's still so much that isn't accounted for and so much that is being understood and documented and figured out all the time. That's why the number of languages that are estimated to exist in the world is still going up even in the face of so many languages where speakers aren't passing them on to their children. They're no longer being spoken. Even as the world is losing its stock of languages, we haven't even caught up to know how many languages there are in the first place."
73,115,Gretchen,"To some degree, even though it's interesting to try to have ever more precision with respect to a number, it's also maybe something that even when things are known -- 'Okay, we know that people in these two villages are different on the following parameters,' that's something you can say. You can say, 'Okay, mostly people in Village A can understand people in Village B, and vice versa, but not entirely,' that's something you can determine with investigation and by asking people and by making lists of words and things. But then the downstream question of, 'Okay, does that mean Village A and Village B speak different languages, or does that mean they speak dialects of the same language?', often 'dialect' is used to shunt varieties into the we-don't-care-about-this box. That's a political decision, too."
73,116,Lauren,"I always find it really interesting because 'dialect' is a pretty neutral term most of the time in linguistics, but it has all these connotations more generally of being not the formal language, not the standard language, not the language you should use in schools. I think for that reason a lot of linguists now use the word 'variety' as a less-loaded term when referring to different 'varieties' rather than different 'dialects.' We use 'dialect' a lot because it is still relatively neutral as a technical term."
73,117,Gretchen,"Sometimes, you also get people trying to reclaim it in the other direction by saying, 'Everybody has a dialect.' The standard dialect or prestige dialect is also just one dialect among many that isn't inherently better. It's just based on the associations people have made. Sometimes, you can try to reclaim 'dialect' in the other direction. But I mean, also, you get 'variety' used a lot to try to say, 'Look, there can be lots of varieties for lots of different reasons,' sometimes geographic and sometimes for other social reasons or other types of groups."
73,118,Lauren,"On the other hand, you have situations like in China where all of these languages that aren't able to be understood by speakers of the other languages are called 'dialects' to bring them into a larger nation state project. Again, you see that nation state effect on how we're counting languages."
73,119,Gretchen,"Something that's interesting about looking at languages through maps is that all these different local dialects are equally old. All of the varieties of Faroese are all descending from Old Norse. They all come back to a common ancestor. Sometimes, when you're looking at a language through, okay, well, here's the capital city, and everything else is just a version of that, there's this weird version of population migration history that comes into your head where you think, okay, well, people must have spread out from the capital city and then gradually started talking differently, where really people lived somewhere for various reasons and came to an area for various reasons and started speaking particular ways for various reasons, and there wasn't really ever one time when everyone spoke the same way in a group of people unless you go through a very tiny population bottleneck where it was a very small group of people, and they gradually spread out. But everything is equally old, and it all comes back to the same ancestors that they have."
73,120,Lauren,"Once you begin to understand that complexity of history, the fuzzy boundaries that can exist with where you draw the lines on your Sprachbund, you begin to see why it's very hard to map something like language compared to something like, 'Is it a country? What kind of climate does it have?'"
73,121,Gretchen,"Right. Because for one thing, I mean, languages overlap a lot. There's often people who speak multiple languages in a given place. And then how many languages are spoken in a given place is this complicated question. There are way more languages than we have colours. We often use colours to display different concepts on a map, and it's really useful when it comes to nation states because you rarely have 20 nation states all bordering on each other, so you need to use like 20 colours. You can generally do this with I think it's five colours or so. But this is really hard with languages because there are not 7,000-ish colours that the human eye can distinguish. Trying to map this gets really complicated."
73,122,Lauren,"There are times when language mapping can be interesting. Often, on the show, we'll give examples from the World Atlas of Linguistic Structures, which looks at grammatical features that exist in a sample of the world's languages. Every language is reduced to one point on the map, which obviously from everything we've been talking about with our grad tour of continua of language, obviously a point doesn't really cut it. Exactly what they're counting as a language varies depending on what they're documenting. But what's really nice about these maps is that you get this big spread of dots. They're in two or three different colours depending on how many features you're comparing. So, for this show, I've linked to one of my favourite WALS maps which is whether a language has the same word for 'hand' and 'arm' or a different word for 'hand' and 'arm.'"
73,123,Gretchen,Do you think it's related to whether the climate wants you to wear long-sleeved clothing so that you see this distinction between your hand and your arm?
73,124,Lauren,"I've never thought about that before. What is really nice at this zoomed out, big picture level is that you can see that there are groups of languages that tend to do the same thing. Across Australia, languages tend to have different words for 'hand' and 'arm,' whereas across the Pacific, languages tend to have the same word for 'hand' and 'arm.'"
73,125,Gretchen,"Right. Sometimes, these points can -- if you're trying to reduce 7,000 or even this map is like 500 languages, which is still a pretty good number, you're trying to reduce 500 data points to something that's visualisable. You can say, 'Okay, well, we put each language as a dot, then we can see most of the languages in Western Europe distinguish between 'hand' and 'arm.' There's a band of languages in Sub-Saharan Africa that don't distinguish between them. Most of the languages in South America do distinguish between them.' You can come up with these very quick evaluations of what the whole area looks like at the expense of reducing a language to a dot point."
73,126,Lauren,"Exactly. There's a trade-off there, and I think the important thing to always remember is what is the trade-off you're making with information because it can be really difficult to use the limited vocabulary that we have for maps in displaying the complexity of languages. There's this really beautiful map called 'native-land.ca' that focuses on the territories of Indigenous groups of people across the world. If you zoom in on North America, you can see this really beautiful texture of overlapping land and names and stories and territories."
73,127,Gretchen,"The overlapping polygons idea, which is a really interesting way of representing the idea that multiple people can have been in an area at a given time, and it isn't necessarily like, 'Okay, this part's red; this part's blue; and there's no purple in between.' You get these semi-translucent polygons that overlap each other and show that multiple groups of people were in a particular area. It's also hard to read. And especially would be even harder to read if you tried to represent even more languages on it. This is a really interesting way of approaching this problem of just trying to shade in particular areas is necessarily incomplete by doing these overlapping translucent polygons. But I don't know if any mapping solution can ever display all of this information."
73,128,Lauren,Having a sense when you're looking at any other way of mapping things that there's probably more happening with the story is just a really good first start.
73,129,Gretchen,"I think if we can make one generalisation of this, it's that for all the problems that maps have, flags are even worse."
73,130,Lauren,"Hmm, yes. Just representing a language with a nation state flag is not a very effective way of doing things."
73,131,Gretchen,"Because even with all the complexities that come with speech bands of continuums of particular languages, a flag is just gonna say, 'Everybody in this nation speaks the same language,' which is so far from being the case in so many circumstances."
73,132,Lauren,"So, if languages aren't the map, and languages are certainly not flags, what are they?"
73,133,Gretchen,"Well, I have another analogy that I'd like to try on you. What if we thought of languages like stars?"
73,134,Lauren,Right. I'm a bit worried because we already are stretching the Lingthusiasm travel budget with our global language survey but take us to the stars.
73,135,Gretchen,"I was thinking about this because I was trying to think about, you know, 7,000, it's kind of a big number, and yet it's also a number that we should be able to get a handle on somehow because it's within human experience. What are other things that there are 7,000-ish of? I looked up how many stars are visible with the naked eye from Earth."
73,136,Lauren,Okay. And how many is that?
73,137,Gretchen,"Well, if there's no light pollution, and you have 20/20 vision, you can see about 5,000 stars per side of the Earth, so 10,000 total."
73,138,Lauren,But like a similar order of magnitude that we're talking about here.
73,139,Gretchen,"Right. And when you lie on your back in a dark, grassy field, and you look up at the stars, and you think, 'Wow! There are so many of these pinpricks of light,' and each of these is an entire world, and each of these comes with, probably, planets, probably other things going on there. They seem far away, but there's so much going on with each of these. Each of these languages is an entire world of things going on that's just as central to people who are speaking that language as the sun is to me speaking my languages."
73,140,Lauren,"I guess that means that for people who might be in an area that's full of light pollution who might only see the brightest couple of hundred stars in the sky, I guess that's kind of the equivalent of the fact that, for most of our day-to-day life, we might only notice the 200 languages that are on an online translation tool or the 30 languages that a website is available in."
73,141,Gretchen,"Maybe I can only see a couple dozen stars from a city that has lots of other lights competing with it, and these are the big, famous languages that are often found in drop-down menus. But then there's lots of other languages when you have the chance to actually see the full set. The other cool thing about this analogy is, have you seen the new photos of the galaxies that have been coming out?"
73,142,Lauren,"Oh, yeah, from that deep space telescope."
73,143,Gretchen,"Yeah. They point the telescope at a dark patch of the sky that we didn't think we could see any stars in, and there were so many galaxies."
73,144,Lauren,"I love the photos that compare the new images from, say, something taken with Hubble where a patch of sky in the old images had a few stars, and then the new images you have galaxies behind those. There's even more out there than we possibly thought."
73,145,Gretchen,"So, maybe a Sprachbund or a dialect continuum is more like an entire galaxy where all of these things are related to each other. Or like the clouds and the dust and the nebulae that give rise to new stars and that interact with each other and birth new stars are like how languages can come in contact with each other and birth new languages or varieties."
73,146,Lauren,"The best thing is we don't even have to wait billions of years for the galaxies to get to us. There are speakers of the world's languages who can share with us their dialect diversity, that can share with us the experience of living in their own linguistic galaxy, and that means we get to learn from each other straight away."
73,147,Gretchen,"You never know. Maybe in one of these galaxies, in one of these stars and one of these solar systems somewhere, there are other beings that have some way of communicating that we can eventually learn about. In the meantime, we have lots of science fiction writers to speculate about that. [Music]"

74,14,Lauren,What is a question?
74,15,Gretchen,Is this a question?
74,16,Lauren,Am I doing a question now?
74,17,Gretchen,"This is a question here, right?"
74,18,Lauren,Question?
74,19,Gretchen,Question.
74,20,Lauren,We use questions to gather information from each other. It's why they're very handy in a conversation.
74,21,Gretchen,"Sometimes, we also use questions for stylistic or rhetorical effect since we didn't really answer any of those introductory questions."
74,22,Lauren,That is true. But it's also good to note that questions can have a variety of different grammatical shapes and different patterns to how we articulate them.
74,23,Gretchen,One of the things that I think is really cool about questions is the way they cut across a bunch of different linguistic subfields. There are things about the words and the orders of the words and their relationships with each other when it comes to questions. There're also things about how you modulate the pitch of your voice to make a question. And then there are things about how questions fit into social situations. It really lets us talk about a whole bunch of different areas in linguistics under one simple question.
74,24,Lauren,Let's start with the tone of voice that we use to ask a question.
74,25,Gretchen,This is 'Question?'
74,26,Lauren,Where your voice goes up at the end to indicate that you're asking a question.
74,27,Gretchen,"This is sometimes called 'question intonation.' This is the way the intonation or the pitch of your voice changes to make something into a question. It's fairly common, at least in the languages that I've studied to any degree, to be like, 'Yeah, well, you know, here are some various grammatical strategies to make questions, or you can just use question intonation, i.e., making the pitch of your voice rise towards the end of the sentence.'"
74,28,Lauren,This is a common strategy across languages but isn't universally required.
74,29,Gretchen,"Actually, doing a rising intonation at the end of a sentence to indicate a question isn't even always indicative of a question in English."
74,30,Lauren,"No. When I ask, 'What is a question?', I didn't have to use rising intonation because we had that question word 'what' there. It was very clear that it was acting as a question, and I didn't need that rising intonation."
74,31,Gretchen,"In fact, if you had, 'What is a question?' [with rising intonation], it would almost have sounded like you didn't know whether you wanted to be asking that question."
74,32,Lauren,It adds that uncertainty to it.
74,33,Gretchen,"Which is a thing that rising intonation can also do in English. If I say something like, 'It's raining out?', it might be asking, but I might also just be indicating uncertainty about whether or not it's raining. Questions in English where the structure of the words and how they're put together already indicates that it's a question are actually the ones that often don't use that rising intonation for a question. It's individual words or phrases that otherwise you couldn't tell that they're a question, that's when this rising intonation shows up the most."
74,34,Lauren,"There's also my favourite type of question intonation, which is the British down step, which sounds like an old-fashioned dance, actually, now I say it out loud."
74,35,Gretchen,I love this one. I think this is the one that I pick up on whenever I'm talking to British-speaking folks because it just feels very contagious to me.
74,36,Lauren,Would you like to give an example? 'Would you like to give an example?' [Down step]
74,37,Gretchen,"Ah, there you are. That's sort of the 'Would you like a cup of tea?' [Down step]"
74,38,Lauren,"Yeah, I find myself very compelled by it as well. It is much more of a British form of intonation than North American. We don't really have it in Australia either. But whenever I hang around British people that do have this, I feel really compelled by it, and I find myself using it very easily."
74,39,Gretchen,"This is the one that's got -- on the final word, there's a relatively sharp fall and this little rise. It's a little bit hard to hear on 'tea' because that's just one syllable, but if you say something with two syllables, 'Would you like a cup of coffee?' [down step], then you have the CO-ffe-E going down and then up again. You can get this nice little shape, which is really fun."
74,40,Lauren,[Down stepping] 'Would you like a banana?'
74,41,Gretchen,[Down stepping] 'Would you like an apple?' It's great.
74,42,Lauren,I saw this really interesting post about Meghan Markle picking it up as a feature of her increasingly British-influenced accent that made me feel really reassured that it's not just me -- and the fact that you also find it really compelling as well.
74,43,Gretchen,"I think, to be honest, when I first met you, I didn't know whether Australians did this intonation or not. I may have just been doing it around you just to be extra careful -- extra polite."
74,44,Lauren,"Aw, and because it's a very satisfying intonation contour. Intonation is only helpful for making clear something is a question or not in spoken language. We use a lot of written language as well."
74,45,Gretchen,"The classic indicator of this rising intonation and this higher pitch at the end is the question mark. If I'm writing down to remind myself, 'Tea? Coffee?', I could put a question mark after each of those. But because of how the question mark indicates that rising intonation, sometimes it's also used to indicate this upwards pitch at the end of the sentence even when the effect of a question isn't intended. And then the inverse when you're asking a question and you mean it sort of rhetorically or ironically, sometimes people, especially in more internet-influenced styles of English, don't write the question at all. That's a drier question or a non-question that has the form of a question because you can often tell it from the order of the words or other things about the wording."
74,46,Lauren,"I like this as a diagnostic for the fact that we have things that are grammatically questions but there are a variety of different reasons that we use question structures, and not all of them are for 'I want some information from you.'"
74,47,Gretchen,"There's about five different ways that some people talk about the form of a question. Exactly. You have this asking for information -- 'What time is it?' 'Do you have a pen?' People often use a question mark there. There's also requesting action. So, saying something like, 'Could you give me that?' That's sort of a polite question. The question has the effect of politeness. Or 'Would you give me a pen?' This is, again, requesting a particular action."
74,48,Lauren,"I never really thought about the fact that both of those are asking, but they're asking very different types of things -- information and asking someone to do something."
74,49,Gretchen,"Yeah. Actually, in Spanish, there's two different verbs that are used to convey these different types of asks. So, asking information is 'preguntar,' 'me preguntó qué hora fue,' 'He asked me what time it was.' This is the asking for information. But to request an action of someone is 'pedir,' 'Me pidió escribir una carta,' 'He asked me to write a letter.' That's 'ask someone to do something' rather than 'ask someone about something.'"
74,50,Lauren,I love when you find a structure in a language that makes something clear that has a different function to two things that just get lumped together for English. That's really cool.
74,51,Gretchen,"It's really great. Then the other three kinds of questions aren't really about asking at all and, I feel like, tend to grow less and less likely to use question marks when it comes to their written versions because the intonation is also doing very different things. We have rhetorical questions -- 'What can you expect?' 'How could anyone possibly have known?' Sometimes, these are written with a question mark still. I think increasingly in internet-ish styles, they're often not written with a question mark, as I discuss in my book Because Internet. Then the other two that I think are really interesting, which I would really not write with a question mark, are confirmation of known information. So, if I say, 'Did you see that!' [With surprise]"
74,52,Lauren,"Hmm, I think I'd put a punctuation mark like an exclamation mark rather than a question."
74,53,Gretchen,"Right. Exactly. I can say, 'Did you see that?' And then that's asking about information. But if I say, 'Did you see that!', with two down steps there, I think I'd write it with an exclamation mark, and then it's more about the confirmation. Then also there's the intensification use. Something like, 'What a big dog!' 'Would you look at that sunset!'"
74,54,Lauren,"Huh. Yeah, I mean, they have the structure of a question, and I don't even think of those as questions."
74,55,Gretchen,"Like, I'm not saying, 'Would you look at this sunset for me and tell me why it's green?'"
74,56,Lauren,"'Yeah, okay, I can do that. Sure.'"
74,57,Gretchen,"That's a requesting of action. 'Would you look at this cup for me and tell me if you think it's broken?' Those are real questions that are asking for something. But 'Would you look at that sunset!', again, it's got this choppier intonation, and I think I would, again, have to write that with an exclamation mark."
74,58,Lauren,"So, we have five different functions and only the ones that are soliciting information or requesting actions we actually tend to think of as really being questions even though they all have the structure of a question."
74,59,Gretchen,Right. Sort of capital Q question-y questions compared to the sort of things that borrow from the world of questions and are actually accomplishing something else. Let's talk about some of these gold standard capital Q question-y questions.
74,60,Lauren,Sure. We can broadly divide questions into two different types. They tend to have different structures because they're doing different things. The first type are questions where we're just soliciting a yes/no or a binary or a polar question choice.
74,61,Gretchen,'Is/is not.' 'Do/do not.' 'Do or do not. There is no try.' Sometimes these get called 'polar questions.' I think 'yes-no questions' may be easier to keep track of from a talking out loud perspective.
74,62,Lauren,'Do you like questions?' would be a great example.
74,63,Gretchen,"'Yes, I do.' 'No, I do not.' This solicits an answer that is either yes or no. English is kind of weird about these because we've got this 'do' there."
74,64,Lauren,"I think, just as a spoiler, English is weird about questions in general. We're gonna see this with all the question structures."
74,65,Gretchen,I have questions about English and questions.
74,66,Lauren,So many questions about English.
74,67,Gretchen,"A more typical language for yes-no questions might be doing something more like Italian where you have, you know, here's the statement that you're saying, but you've put a question mark after it. Something like, 'Stai bene?', which is literally like, 'You are good?', but you've made it a question."
74,68,Lauren,"I can either answer, 'Sì,' 'Yes,' or 'No,' 'No.'"
74,69,Gretchen,"Or something like, 'Parlano italiano?' 'They speak Italian?'"
74,70,Lauren,'Sì.'
74,71,Gretchen,No.
74,72,Lauren,'No.'
74,73,Gretchen,"And here, the 'they' or the 'you' there is not said aloud because Italian doesn't need them. But that's not the part that makes them more typical as a question, it's just, here's the statement that you're making, and you can make it into a question. They're not adding a word like 'do' or moving a word like, 'Are you good?', 'Are you okay?' They're not doing any of that stuff. It's just you can just say it, but say it with a question intonation, it's fine."
74,74,Lauren,"If I see a group of people, and I say, 'Parlano Italiano?', 'Do they speak Italian?', and then they all start speaking Italian, I can say, 'Parlano Italiano!', and I don't have to change anything about the order of those words for it to be a statement. 'They do speak Italian.'"
74,75,Gretchen,"You can do this in English to make yes-no questions. You can say something like, 'You good?' 'Yeah, you're good.' Or 'They speak Italian?' 'They speak Italian.' You can do this in intonation with English. But it's not as much of the default strategy. The default strategy is like, you got to do other stuff with 'do' and moving words around."
74,76,Lauren,Definitely much more informal to do that kind of question structure.
74,77,Gretchen,"And it sort of implies in English that you expect the answer to be yes if you say something like, 'They speak Italian?' 'They speak Italian.'"
74,78,Lauren,"Ah, yeah, I never thought about that, but I feel like that makes sense."
74,79,Gretchen,"Whereas if they say, 'Do they speak Italian?', you're sort of more open for the answer to be yes or no. I think that intonation has a more neutral connotation in languages where that's the default strategy."
74,80,Lauren,"It's not the only way to do yes-no questions by any stretch of the imagination. I find it very convenient that Mandarin Chinese uses two other really common strategies that we can talk about, one of them being just a particle that says, 'Hey, I'm doing a question right now!'"
74,81,Gretchen,"Right. Mandarin's got this great word, 'ma,' which just means, 'This is a question now.' You can add it to something like 'Nǐ hǎo,' which is 'You good?' literally, and you get, 'Nǐ hǎo ma?' The 'ma' there means like, 'You good (question),' 'Are you good?', 'Are you okay?', 'How are you?' -- effectively. But it's just adding, 'This is a question now.' It's very elegant. It's very straightforward. You can add it to lots of different kinds of sentences and just get, 'This is now the yes-no version of this question.' I think there are quite a lot of languages that have some sort of question particle that's like, 'Yup. Now this is a question.'"
74,82,Lauren,"Yeah, very common to have one either at the beginning or the end of a sentence, particularly. They're good spots to put your question particles. Mandarin also has this other construction where you put the 'yes' part and the 'no' part in the question together. You have the 'yes' version of a verb and the 'no' version of a verb together. So, something like, 'Do you want tea?', the 'do you want' part would be 'Yào bù yào?'"
74,83,Gretchen,"So, that's literally something like, 'Want, not want?'"
74,84,Lauren,"Yeah. Someone says, 'Do you want or not want tea?', as the default question structure. And then you say, 'Yào' or 'Bù yào,' 'I want' or 'I don't want.'"
74,85,Gretchen,"Again, this is making explicit a yes-no question is giving you a choice between two options, you know, 'Do you want this or not?' But in English if you wanna say, 'Do you want this or not?', you still have to have that 'do' there. It's great there."
74,86,Lauren,"In the world's languages, that is a very uncommon structure. We'll post the World Atlas of Linguistic Structures map of which you see English as a little dot that's a very different colour to most of the other things around it because it has a very unusual question structure."
74,87,Gretchen,"Historically in English, it was a little bit more straightforward in that you just put the verb at the beginning of the sentence. If you say something like, 'Have you the time?', where in present-day English you'd have to say something like, 'Do you have the time?', but in Shakespeare, which is Early-Modern English and earlier, and still in languages like German, you can say something like, 'Have you the time?' or 'Watch you the video?' or 'See you this fish?' or something like that."
74,88,Lauren,'Watch you the video?' being a classic line from Shakespeare.
74,89,Gretchen,"Shakespeare was so big into watching videos. 'Watch you this play?' Then what happened in English is that we kept the ability to put the verb at the beginning of the sentence only for auxiliary verbs. You can say, 'Are you watching the video?', 'Can you watch the video?', 'Might you watch the video?', 'Have you seen the video?', but you don't have the ability to just say, 'See you the video?' or 'Watch you the video?' anymore. That's where the 'do' comes in because 'do' is this lightweight thing that you can just put in if you've got to move something to the front of the sentence, but your verb is too heavy."
74,90,Lauren,"Thank you, 'do.'"
74,91,Gretchen,"English has ended up down this interesting historical pathway, but that means that when you go to learn another language from English, you're always saying, 'All right. Well, I'm really, really confident it's not gonna do the 'do' thing that English does for arcane historical reasons.' It's gonna do something else -- a more normal thing, like intonation or having a question particle."
74,92,Lauren,"This is also true for our other main type of question. Our first type of question was 'Do you have the time?' Yes-no, kind of forced-choice answer. Our second type of question asks for a more open but particular piece of information like, 'What is the time?' or 'When are you coming over?'"
74,93,Gretchen,"These questions use words like, 'who,' 'what,' 'where,' 'when,' 'why,' and 'how,' which are often called 'wh-words' in English because most of them, except for 'how,' begin with W-H. Linguists sometimes refer to these questions as 'wh-questions' for that reason, which is super a piece of terminology that doesn't really hold up across other languages, but it's easy to remember, so we're gonna keep it for now."
74,94,Lauren,"For English questions like, 'What time is it?', 'Where are we meeting?', that wh-word is always at the start of the question that you're asking."
74,95,Gretchen,"I feel like we're arranging a secret assignment or something like that. You know, 'Where are we gonna be? Will you have the letter? And what time? Where? Who's gonna meet us?'"
74,96,Lauren,I thought we were just catching up for coffee and cake. You have a much more sinister-minded motive behind all these questions than I do.
74,97,Gretchen,"I like to think of my cake assignations as very important, yes."
74,98,Lauren,"But we're putting all those wh-words at the start, regardless of the nature of the appointment that we're keeping."
74,99,Gretchen,"In principle, right, these wh-words are at the beginning in questions in English, you know, 'Who's gonna be there?', 'What time?' But also, the answers to all of those have the answer towards the end of the sentence. So, 'You are WHERE?' 'You're at the café.' 'Let's meet WHEN?' 'Let's meet at 2 o'clock.' You're meeting WHO?' 'We're meeting our friends, the secret agents, obviously.' Just for a fun little secret agent tea and cake."
74,100,Lauren,Which is a possible but not the typical way of asking these questions as well and really just shows that the information doesn't always have to be at the start even though we tend to put it at the start for a question structure.
74,101,Gretchen,"A lot of European languages like to do this thing where those wh-words, which don't begin with W-H in more of these other languages, go to the beginning of the sentence. But not all the Indo-European languages because the Indic languages -- so Hindi, I think Nepali, as well, probably a lot of languages in that area -- don't allow you to move those wh-words to the beginning of the sentence."
74,102,Lauren,"That's right. In Nepali, the wh-words are K-words. If we'd started with Nepali grammarians doing the world's linguistic diversity, we'd be talking about 'K-words.'"
74,103,Gretchen,"You know, to be honest, in Indo-European in general, a lot of these words begin with a K sound or a Q-U or a C. This would be a lot more typologically valid, at least for one language family. It's just very English-centric that we're talking about wh-words instead of, like, KW-words, which is the more, at least for one very large language family, accurate way of talking about them."
74,104,Lauren,"In Nepali, if you say, 'Hāmī kahām̐ bhēṭauṁ,' that 'kahām̐' is 'where.' 'Hāmī kyāphē bhēṭauṁ,' 'We meet at the café.' You don't change the word order at all which, again, is a lot more of a simple solution than English's moving of it."
74,105,Gretchen,"I had to, interestingly, sort of unlearn this in French because in school in French, you learn, 'Oh, yeah, you move all those wh-words, the 'Q-U words,' to the beginning of the sentence,' which is still the formal French way to do it, but in conversation, most of the time, people don't actually move them, and you sound more natural if you don't move them. There're some languages where it's sort of optional, like French. There're some languages where you really do move them almost all the time, like in English, and then there're some languages really nobody ever moves them at all, and that's more like Nepali."
74,106,Lauren,"I like the slight outrage that comes with English if you don't move it. Like, 'You are WHERE?' Like, 'I'm outraged that you're not at the café where we're meant to be meeting."
74,107,Gretchen,"That's similar to how in English if you're asking yes-no questions just with intonation, 'You LIKE cake?' It sounds sort of incredulous or like you expect a particular direction of the answer rather than being a default strategy that is more pragmatically unmarked or more pragmatically neutral."
74,108,Lauren,"Once again, it's worth just pointing out that English has the less common way of doing questions. In the World Atlas of Linguistic Structures there're more than twice as many languages where moving the wh-word to the front is not what's done. There're a lot of languages that do it, but not all, and by no stretch of the imagination."
74,109,Gretchen,"Also, that sometimes we move for wh-questions in English both the 'do' and the wh-word. So, if you're saying something like, 'Why don't you come?', you've got a 'do' in there, like we saw earlier, and you've got a wh-word. Again, the 'do' thing, that's just not what other languages do."
74,110,Lauren,It's like English was designed to keep syntax people really busy and happy. That's my theory.
74,111,Gretchen,"Speaking of things that keep syntacticians really happy, there's another thing you can do for questions. This is maybe my favourite question thing because they're so versatile, and they're fun, and you can do lots of things with them. They're a little bit more flexible. These are tag questions."
74,112,Lauren,"Ooo, they sound fun!"
74,113,Gretchen,"This is when you have a main sentence, like a normal sentence, and then you can add a little extra thing at the end to make into a question that is sort of tacked on, like a little tag on a piece of clothing, to make it more question-y. The classic, very formal English example is saying something like, 'Isn't it?' So, 'It's cold, isn't it?'"
74,114,Lauren,"'Tag questions are interesting, aren't they?'"
74,115,Gretchen,"Right. But there's more fun versions. You can say, 'It's cold out, right?'"
74,116,Lauren,"Ah, yeah, it's doing the same thing with an even shorter tag."
74,117,Gretchen,"Yeah. I think it's that little pause, maybe, before the tag question that distinguishes it from you just have a question word that's the default way of asking a question because 'It's cold out, right?' or 'It's cold out, isn't it?', again, sort of expects an answer in a particular direction and has this little pause before it. One of my favourites from the Britishism department is the contraction of 'isn't it' which is 'innit?'"
74,118,Lauren,"Ah, yes."
74,119,Gretchen,"So, 'It's cold, innit?' I'm probably not saying that as Britishly as people who actually have that in their native dialects do."
74,120,Lauren,"I like that 'innit' has just become so stable and contracted that you can use it in a variety of places where you'd have to have a different tag for something else. Like, 'Tag questions are interesting, innit?' which, again, I am absolutely not the right kind of British English speaker to pull that off, whereas with the full tag I needed to say, 'aren't they,' and have the 'aren't' match the plural of tag questions. 'Innit' has just become its own solid little tag by itself."
74,121,Gretchen,"Which is, again, the cool thing about tags is that you can just keep putting stuff in tags because they're sort of more versatile or flexible. English is stuck with this weird 'do' situation for complicated historic reasons, but you can just keep innovating and make 'innit,' and it's really fun. Another fun tag question is in Japanese. The tag question form is 'ne.'"
74,122,Lauren,"Oh, that's definitely a thing I hear in Japanese TV shows."
74,123,Gretchen,"I've seen speculation online that the 'ne' in Japanese is somehow related to Portuguese, which also has a tag question in 'ne,' which comes from 'isn't it?', like, 'Não é?' But unfortunately, I looked up this etymology, and it seems like this is an accident. This is just convergent evolution. Sometimes things resemble each other, and they're not actually related. It would've been cool if it was, but it seems like it's not."
74,124,Lauren,It's just one of those things where tag questions tend to be really short and reduced and get shorter as people use them more and more. Perhaps unsurprising you get them with the same shape across different languages.
74,125,Gretchen,"Exactly. I think I need to say my favourite tag question as a Canadian is obviously 'eh,' Canadian 'eh.'"
74,126,Lauren,"Oh, yeah, of course."
74,127,Gretchen,"Which is a very short and reduced form. Obviously, it's just one vowel. The cool thing about 'eh' is that it's a bit different from how other tag questions are used in English because other tag questions in English, you can't put them on sentences that are already questions."
74,128,Lauren,Okay.
74,129,Gretchen,"So, if you say something like, 'Did you see the game last night, did you?'"
74,130,Lauren,"[Laughs] You sound very insistent, but it definitely doesn't feel like a tag question."
74,131,Gretchen,"Right. Or 'What are you trying to say, are you?'"
74,132,Lauren,"Okay, that definitely does not work."
74,133,Gretchen,"That just crashes, yeah. Or using 'right' for your tag question, 'Did you see the game last night, right?'"
74,134,Lauren,"Okay, that works as a tag question in the examples we had before and not there because it's a question already."
74,135,Gretchen,"But 'eh' can be added to both yes-no questions and wh-questions, and it's still okay. So, 'Did you see the game last night, eh?' This is fine for me."
74,136,Lauren,That sounds like a thing a Canadian would say. I perhaps don't have the best intuitions about this.
74,137,Gretchen,"Or 'What are you trying to say, eh?' This also sounds totally fine to my Canadian ears. This is something that's sort of unique about 'eh' that it can also be added as a tag question to another question where most tag questions in English don't let you do that."
74,138,Lauren,"Oh, it's very flexible."
74,139,Gretchen,"Isn't it great, eh?"
74,140,Lauren,"The other cool thing about questions, as well as their intonation and their grammar, is how they get really interesting when we look at how they're used in the conversation context."
74,141,Gretchen,"Ah! You know, like my hobby."
74,142,Lauren,Which is?
74,143,Gretchen,"Well, it's interpreting the semantic structure of a question while ignoring the pragmatic context."
74,144,Lauren,"Ah, can you give me an example of that?"
74,145,Gretchen,Yes. [Pause]
74,146,Lauren,"Okay, you've established that you could give me an example of that, and I feel like by not volunteering the example when I ask that question and treating it as a yes-no question with no other requests for information has really proven your point, good job."
74,147,Gretchen,I really have ignored the pragmatic context which is often people asking a yes-no question and they're looking for an answer that's longer than just yes or no. I didn't come up with this. This is a meme that makes its way around the internet in various formats. I think it's really great though.
74,148,Lauren,A self-evidencing example is always a true delight.
74,149,Gretchen,"Absolutely. This idea that, oftentimes, when we're asking what seems to be a yes-no question, we're actually expecting, and often providing, more information than that made me feel really validated in a thread on Twitter from the linguist Liz Stokoe, who pointed out that when you actually look at questions in the wild in use in corpora, oftentimes people actually do answer a yes-no question with more than just 'Yes' or 'No' in response."
74,150,Lauren,"Because, as we've just established, to not do so comes across really dry and unhelpful in the conversation."
74,151,Gretchen,Right. A few examples that she has from context: 'Do you have pets?'
74,152,Lauren,"I mean, my answer is 'No,' but then I feel like I have to give you the reason why we don't have pets based on various factors. Even with a 'No,' I already feel like I'm opening up more about that."
74,153,Gretchen,"The answer in her corpus is 'Yes, two cats,' which I know you don't have two cats, but that's the kind of thing that people say when they do have pets."
74,154,Lauren,"I was gonna read from your script, and then I was like, 'But then people will think I have two cats, and I don't, for, like, complicated reasons. It's not that I don't like pets.' Here we go. But yeah, as soon as someone says, 'Two cats,' you go, 'Ah, do they hang out together?' Suddenly, you have an in to asking more questions because people always love to talk about their pets."
74,155,Gretchen,"The same thing with asking someone do they have kids. People will often start talking about specifically their kids and their ages and these sorts of things rather than just say, 'Yes' or 'No' in a very blunt sort of way."
74,156,Lauren,"If I call up and say, 'Can I make an appointment?', at the hairdressers, they're not just gonna say, 'Yes,' and then that's it. They're going to be like, 'Yes, when are you available? What would you like to have done?'"
74,157,Gretchen,"Especially when the answer is a little bit more dis-preferred, if it's something that you feel a bit socially awkward about. Stokoe has this example with a salesperson and a client saying, 'And do you have internet access at all, Mr. Jones?' And the client says, 'Uh, yeah, the wife's got a laptop.' That really conveys some particular things about Mr. Jones and his relationship to the internet which is like he's sort of online but maybe not very online rather than just 'Yes, technically, there's internet access in the household.'"
74,158,Lauren,He doesn't seem to be really looking for it there.
74,159,Gretchen,"There's actually a really great example, also from Stokoe's corpus, about someone doing this very literal 'Yes' answer to yes-no questions in a way that makes the other person prod for information."
74,160,Lauren,"Okay, should we do a little radio play of it?"
74,161,Gretchen,"Yeah. So, this is in a café. You have a café customer, café staff, and the customer says, 'Do you have Wi-Fi?'"
74,162,Lauren,"'Yes, we do.'"
74,163,Gretchen,"'Uh, can customers use it?'"
74,164,Lauren,"'Yes, they can.'"
74,165,Gretchen,'Do I need a code or...?'
74,166,Lauren,"Apparently, according to this, I point to the place on the wall where the code is."
74,167,Gretchen,"'Uh, thanks.' Most of the time, I think, when a customer says, 'Do you have Wi-Fi?', they're saying, 'And how do I get on it?' or 'What's the password?' not just, 'Yep, okay. So, I can use it. Okay, but like, how do I do that?'"
74,168,Lauren,"That really strikes me as a staff member who is very sick of pointing to the sign. And you see how immediately unhelpful that is. I feel like this research and these observations are really helpful because I feel like there's a kind of teaching you how to do conversation that's like, 'Ask open questions. These yes-no questions really trap people into locked answers.'"
74,169,Gretchen,"And if we actually analyse what people are doing in conversation, it turns out that asking a yes-no question, people will often continue volunteering information or provide a springboard for doing that rather than saying to somebody, you know, 'Do you have kids, and if so, how many, and what are their ages?', saying, 'Do you have kids?', will often lead people into volunteering how many and what their ages are and these sorts of additions onto the questions. There's this post about using yes-no questions in a psychotherapy context where you're trying to have people open up, but sometimes saying, 'Do you feel this particular way?', can be a way of someone talking about their feelings more or even asking a question like, 'Can you tell me more?', which in its form looks like it's kind of a yes-no question. You know, 'Can you tell me more?' 'Yes.' Now, I'm gonna stop talking. It probably, actually, has the effect of saying, 'I'd like you to tell me more. Please tell me more,' but sometimes phrased in a more polite way. Getting really hung up on the difference between the sort of, 'Oh, you have to ask questions with wh-words in them because that's the only kind of open question' doesn't actually seem to be how conversation is structured if you look at what people are actually doing."
74,170,Lauren,"In fact, the more important thing is just to think about who is likely to have information and who has the right to ask questions and who has the right to answer questions."
74,171,Gretchen,"This brings us to a really interesting thing that speakers of Yélî Dnye do, which is a language spoken in Rossel Island of Papua New Guinea. They don't use the structural things that we talked about to mark a question, whether that's a question word or changing the word order, but they use instead a deep understanding of the social context. They don't use question intonation either."
74,172,Lauren,That's all the strategies we've discussed so far for having ways or rearranging or adding words or using intonation to mark questions. Their questions really are identical to statements.
74,173,Gretchen,"But people can still tell if a question is being asked because of the informational mismatch between what you think the other person is likely to know. If you assume the person you're speaking to has a younger brother, but you're not sure, you want them to confirm it, you could say something like, 'You have a younger brother,' to which they could reply, 'Yes, I do' or 'No, I don't,' because in context you know that they are a higher authority of whether or not they have a younger brother than you are probably."
74,174,Lauren,Yeah. The 'You have pets' would obviously come across as a question because I know who's in my household more than you do.
74,175,Gretchen,"Right. If I talk about somebody's internal states, you know, 'You're hungry,' that actually means 'Are you hungry?' because how could I know whether you're hungry or not except if you tell me."
74,176,Lauren,"It reminds me a little bit of how questions get asked that use evidentials. In Lamjung Yolmo and the other languages I've worked with, which is that you have to ask a question of someone, and they have to answer with whether they know because they saw something or because they heard about it. You ask the question by using the form of evidence you think they're most likely to have based on their experience. You have to keep track of whether this person has the likelihood of answering a question and what evidence they're gonna use to answer the question with."
74,177,Gretchen,"So, this is something like, if you're saying, 'Do you know if someone's still around?' or 'Do you think they're still around?' or 'Have you seen this person recently?' like, whether they're likely to know?"
74,178,Lauren,"Whether they're likely to know because they saw the person or heard. Or a really good example is the difference between 'Are you hungry?' or 'Is she hungry?' where, if I ask you if you're hungry, I'm gonna use, 'Do you have personal experience of the hunger?', whereas if I ask about someone else, 'Is this other person hungry? Have you been told?'"
74,179,Gretchen,"Right. Because I wouldn't be able to experience that directly. This sounds like it might be useful in talking especially about people in social situations. I wanna say, like, 'Did they have a nice party?', there's a difference between whether you think I was there at the party having direct experience of it being nice or whether I simply heard about it after it happened, and I think it went really well."
74,180,Lauren,"Yeah. And it's not that we aren't aware of this in English as well, it's just that we're forced to make a grammatical choice in these languages with evidential systems that shows up this information asymmetry or access to information in a different way."
74,181,Gretchen,"Whereas in English, doing so is optional. Like, you can do it, but you don't have to."
74,182,Lauren,"Yeah. And if I asked, 'Did they have a nice party?' and you say, 'Oh, I didn't go, but someone else said it was great,' I'd be like, 'Ah, okay.' I might've asked because I thought you'd been there."
74,183,Gretchen,Right. It sort of embeds what your assumptions are.
74,184,Lauren,"I found the way that people do questions in conversation so interesting that I spent a whole chapter of my thesis thinking about questions in the grammar and conversations of Lamjung Yolmo, and I think it is because they bring together the phonetics with the intonation patterns and the grammar with the word choices and the word order and, unescapably, the conversational context for how people make the choices of the types of questions they ask and the types of questions that they give.

75,6,Gretchen,"Lauren, I have a sort of philosophical question. Do you think emotions are things like numbers, like things that sort of exist at some level out in the world, or things that are more like food where what constitutes food is really culturally specific?"
75,7,Lauren,I'm gonna answer your philosophical question with some linguistic data.
75,8,Gretchen,Amazing.
75,9,Lauren,There is a really great paper that has looked at how different cultures carve up the emotion space in terms of the words they use for different emotions.
75,10,Gretchen,That sounds like a really interesting way of answering that question.
75,11,Lauren,This was a project from Joshua Conrad Jackson and a whole team who looked at how different languages group together different emotions into a single word -- a process that they call 'colexification.'
75,12,Gretchen,"If we take a non-emotional, more concrete example of this to start, for example, a word like 'pueblo' in Spanish could be translated into English with either 'people' or 'village.' This suggests that these two concepts may be more closely linked in Spanish where 'pueblo' can mean both of these things versus in English where you have two words and treat them as more distinct concepts."
75,13,Lauren,"Or Japanese has 'shima' for 'community' or 'island.' Again, two things that we have as separate words in English put together in the same word in another language."
75,14,Gretchen,The inverse can also be the case. There're things that English puts together as one word that another language might split.
75,15,Lauren,"Oh my gosh, in terms of emotions, the one that I think feeds a lot of the English romance novel tradition is the fact that the word 'love' can mean so many different types of love, which causes all kinds of confusion in romance novels, maybe daily life."
75,16,Gretchen,"You have romantic love, familial love, things like -- so in Spanish, you have 'querer,' which is more like love you have for your friends or family, and 'amar,' which is more like I'm 'in love' with someone. English doesn't really distinguish between these."
75,17,Lauren,Indeed.
75,18,Gretchen,"I think Ancient Greek distinguishes between 'agape' and 'philia' and various other types of love. Again, English isn't distinguishing between these at a lexical level, which isn't to say that English speakers aren't aware at some level that there're multiple kinds of love, just like speakers of other languages can be aware that there are different kinds of other emotions even when there's one word for them."
75,19,Lauren,"It's just what emotions tend to be closely associated with each other because they share a word as a label. In Persian -- to move beyond 'love' -- Persian has a single word that encompasses the concepts of both grief and regret, whereas if you turn to a language like Dargwa, grief is more closely linked with what we would translate as the concept of anxiety. You can see how grief might relate to both regret or anxiety, but these languages have grouped those together in different ways."
75,20,Gretchen,"That's a really interesting thing about this study that they're drawing these maps at the level of a language family showing that certain language families have certain tendencies in terms of which concepts they're associating with each other. They've got a map of Austronesian languages, which are spoken in the South Pacific and Southeast Asia, and they've got fear and surprise as linked together on their emotional map."
75,21,Lauren,"Whereas for the languages of the Nakh-Daghestani group, which is in the area of the Caucasus which runs down from Russia through to Turkey, they have fear linked with anxiety and grief."
75,22,Gretchen,"Right. Which is a different level of, maybe, positivity when it comes to what you're associating fear with, whether it's grief and anxiety or whether it's surprise. Maybe you have a bit of a different cultural association around fear."
75,23,Lauren,"One of the things I really appreciate about these maps is that you tend to find that languages will have very similar maps of emotions in this way to other languages that they are related to historically but also other languages that are just in the geographic area, and it makes me feel really positive about the possibility of understanding your neighbour because there're these tendencies that happen within particular regions."
75,24,Gretchen,"Aw, that's really charming. Even if you don't necessarily speak languages that come from a common ancestor that people seem to converge on emotion words when they're in contact with people who speak something that's in their area."
75,25,Lauren,"But the authors are very clear to point out that even though we see these tendencies, there's still so much variation between even related languages in how we carve up the emotion space and that each language does things from its own particular perspective."
75,26,Gretchen,"And like we saw with 'love' in English, just because a language uses the same word for two concepts that are distinguishable doesn't necessarily mean that speakers aren't distinguishing between them in other ways."
75,27,Lauren,Indeed.
75,28,Gretchen,"Ideally, it seems like it would be really cool if we could do this from a historical perspective as well because if we're finding languages that are historically related or geographically related have similar emotion words, then it seems like looking through history would be a fun way of looking at that."
75,29,Lauren,"You would be correct in thinking that is a fun thing to do. But one of the biggest challenges that we have is that, historically, people weren't really focused on using labels to talk about emotions or to interrogate emotions in written records, which is unfortunately all we have left until we figure out time travel."
75,30,Gretchen,"Definitely something I'd do with a time machine. You get historic texts with something like a character weeping or wailing or tearing their hair or wailing and gnashing of teeth, but you're less likely to get something like 'felt surprise' or 'felt angry' or this sort of detailed psycho-analytic parsing of emotion."
75,31,Lauren,"Yeah, if we look at historical records, a lot of written records were just, 'These people did these things at this time,' and then if it is something about a myth or a story of people, it is very much about the performance of actions. Those actions might be associated with emotions but not a lot of talking about the emotions or the internal states themselves."
75,32,Gretchen,"It's interesting to think of how that changes as literary traditions change. You have going from 'This character was wailing and crying and tearing their hair out,' to maybe a Shakespearean character giving a soliloquy, to characters in novels or things that have stream-of-consciousness style where it's actually trying to replicate what's going on in terms of someone's emotional state. That's a fairly recent development in the history of literature."
75,33,Lauren,"Unfortunately, it means those historical perspectives are still very open questions."
75,34,Gretchen,"Again, something to put in the linguistics time machine box."
75,35,Lauren,It does make you realise just how culturally mediated our experience of emotions are and how we might label them and we might talk about them. That's something that kids have to learn as they are growing up in the languages and the environments that they are being raised in.
75,36,Gretchen,"There's this really fun paper about how kids learn emotion words and develop their emotional expressions, and I think the thing that's the most fun about this is that it puts into academic words what is probably familiar territory for a lot of people if you've met a few kids. Here's a few quotes from this paper. It says, 'By the time language begins, towards the end of the first year, emotional expression is already well-established. Children do not need to learn the names of the emotions in order to tell other people what they are feeling.'"
75,37,Lauren,"So, as a translation, just because kids don't know the word for 'sad' doesn't mean that they can't be very, very sad at you by screaming in your face."
75,38,Gretchen,"[Laughs] Yeah, I think that's basically what it's saying."
75,39,Lauren,"Hm, yeah, that makes sense to me."
75,40,Gretchen,"'But they do need to learn the language to tell other people what their feelings are about. Language does not replace emotional expression, rather children learn language for expressing and articulating the objects and circumstances of their emotional experiences while they continue to express emotion with displays of positive and negative affective tone.'"
75,41,Lauren,Kids can laugh and cry.
75,42,Gretchen,"And throw screaming tantrums on the floor, yeah."
75,43,Lauren,"And throw absolute meltdowns. But they have to learn to talk about these things as well, which is why so many children's books spend so much time talking about the emotions and the feelings of the characters because it's a really great space to practice doing that in."
75,44,Gretchen,"There's so many interesting spaces for figuring out what particular emotions are. I think one of the tools that's also used for adults is an emotion wheel. You have this round circle that has -- on all of the different spokes around the wheel in often various fun colours -- different names of emotions. They try to categorise them by major emotions, or major emotional categories, and to minor and more refined bits of different emotions."
75,45,Lauren,"Oh, I've definitely seen one of these emotion wheels for sure."
75,46,Gretchen,"I think therapists use them sometimes or teachers or educators to try to help scaffold people into talking about emotions. But the thing that fascinates me as a linguist is that there are many emotion wheels, and they're not all the same."
75,47,Lauren,Because you would expect that there are some really prototypical emotion categories that we can break down into more complex or nuanced emotions.
75,48,Gretchen,"Right. But which categories different emotion wheels think of as 'prime' categories or 'primitive' categories that everything else is a refinement of seems to vary depending on the emotion wheel. I saw one that has 'happy' and 'sad' and 'angry' as your basic emotions, and then another one that has things like 'peaceful' and 'powerful' and 'joyful' as your basic emotions."
75,49,Lauren,"Oh, wow. They're very different. I feel like those people are trying to aspire to some kind of abstract synthesis of different emotion types."
75,50,Gretchen,"Right. It's kind of like are you starting with the kid emotions that maybe you learn really early or are you starting with an abstract synthesis. A lot of them end up in fairly similar places. Both of these wheels have 'proud,' but one of them puts 'proud' under 'powerful,' and the other one 'proud' under 'happy.' I mean, you could also think of 'proud' in some contexts as a negative emotion, so putting it under a particular overarching category is making a theoretical statement."
75,51,Lauren,"The thing I find interesting about these emotion wheels is that they often try very hard to have half the wheel be positive emotions and half the wheel be negative emotions. I was thinking about this, and there is one study I've tracked down that's looked at English and Spanish in terms of how many positive and negative emotion words there are. They find for both languages that there are negative skews in terms of the number of words that we have and the number of words we use to talk about negative emotions, which makes sense because if things are going fine, it's fine, and if things aren't going fine, you need a lot more words to explain that."
75,52,Gretchen,I think there's a Tolstoy quote about how every happy family is the same and every unhappy family is different in various different ways.
75,53,Lauren,Or maybe it's just that they have more words to explain their unhappiness.
75,54,Gretchen,"But maybe you need words to talk about exactly the precise degrees to which you are unhappy. Also, like with the pride thing, I don't know if all emotions can be strictly characterised between being positive or negative or being good or bad. Our negative emotions are still there to tell us something. An emotion like 'Schadenfreude,' which is pleasure in someone else's misfortune, is that a positive emotion or a negative emotion? Emotions can also be complex."
75,55,Lauren,"I think that's one of the important things to understand about emotions is that it's not just kids that have to learn labels for emotions. Coming to understand them and coming to find words to express them is really a bit of a lifespan project. I think about how, as I'm getting older, I'm coming to understand really nuanced and complex emotions like one that I can only describe as 'happy crying,' which is a thing that, as I get older, I find myself doing more. I'm like, I'm very confused because this is not an emotion I learnt in a kid's book or I learnt early on or I have a go-to label for but is definitely part of my life as I find myself in more situations where I'm, like, happy but weirdly crying about it."
75,56,Gretchen,"I feel like as a kid I would sometimes see adults doing happy crying and being like, 'What's going on here?' And now I'm like, 'Oh, I know what this is.' The same thing for emotions like nostalgia. The depths of nostalgia that I can arrive at continue to grow as I have more things to be nostalgic about."
75,57,Lauren,"Indeed. That one is gonna be a real lifespan project, isn't it."
75,58,Gretchen,"I think it's also good to point out that there are different routes and paths and paces to the process of figuring out emotions and how to label them. I recently learned the word 'alexithymia,' which is a condition where you have difficulty connecting with and labelling your emotions. I think it can be validating to know that there are words for even the very process of finding it difficult to put words to your emotions."
75,59,Lauren,"'Alexithymia' is a new word for me, but I feel like it's something that could help people make a lot of sense of the way they experience the world and process emotions."
75,60,Gretchen,There's also some interesting research on bilingual people and their experience of emotion terms.
75,61,Lauren,"I guess we talked earlier about how different languages carve up the emotion space, and so having access to emotion vocabularies in different languages that do different things might help with different perspectives on that."
75,62,Gretchen,"Another thing that seems to really affect people is the order and context in which they learned different emotional words in different languages. It often seems to happen that when people learned a language young or with family, they have stronger emotional associations with that language's emotion words, like I think with swear words where if you've been exposed to that swear word in its context a lot, you have a stronger emotional reaction to it. This can be either helpful in the context where, if you're trying to be extra affectionate with someone, like say you're having kids, and you wanna talk about particularly affectionate words, you wanna do that in a language that feels very intimate and affectionate for you, but then also sometimes it can be helpful for people to use that second or third language and have more emotional distance from a concept and make it easier to talk about without getting overwhelmed by emotions."
75,63,Lauren,"There're absolutely advantages in some contexts to feeling a little bit less of an emotional punch when you're using these big emotion words or having big conversations about emotions and feelings. I can see how it's both a useful thing sometimes and a bit of a, like, the distance is unhelpful sometimes."
75,64,Gretchen,"There's one quote from somebody who says, 'I have a preference for French. When my children were born, I wanted to use English just so they would be accustomed to it from an early age, but I just couldn't. It sounded untrue.' That's the sort of affectionate side."
75,65,Lauren,"Then the flip side is a Russian speaker who was reflecting on the fact that saying, 'I love you,' in English is somewhat easier than when they were trying to say, 'I love you,' in Russian. I'm just like, 'Oof.' As someone for whom English is the most easy-to-access emotion language for me, the idea that English is an easy language to say that in does not work in my model of emotions at all. Which language you have more emotional access to, I guess, really depends on your upbringing."
75,66,Gretchen,I think that's something that is difficult when it comes to trying to teach computers about how to understand emotions.
75,67,Lauren,"Yes, given that they, as far as we can tell so far, have access to no actual emotions regardless of which language they start with."
75,68,Gretchen,"You give them a whole bunch of data, give them a whole bunch of emotion words, but then if they're trying to understand something that requires a bit more context like sarcasm or being hyper-negative for emphasis, they fall apart."
75,69,Lauren,"This weird thing we do with language as humans is play with it, and part of playing with it sometimes is -- we talked about some things are ambiguously positive or negative depending on context, but we can actually use highly negative language to be positive because we're trying to get people's attention. For example, I could say something like, 'That puppy is disgustingly cute. I hate it.'"
75,70,Gretchen,"I know not just from the context of 'puppy' and 'cute' but also from the way you're saying it, your tone of voice, your context, that you're actually very positive about this puppy."
75,71,Lauren,'It's so cute!'
75,72,Gretchen,'I can't handle it!' This gets to another facet of talking about emotion which is how the emotions come out from our tone of voice not just from the words we label them from.
75,73,Lauren,"It's not just what we say, it's how we say it."
75,74,Gretchen,There are some acoustic studies about the effect of smiling on various physical parts of the sound signal.
75,75,Lauren,"Ah, okay, because I feel like there's always this advice to smile to sound upbeat, and I just thought that was someone trying to be annoying. But you're saying there are actually observable features that happen if we smile while we're talking."
75,76,Gretchen,"Well, why don't we try something. If I say the same sentence twice -- and I'll try to say it as similar as possible -- but one time I'm smiling, and the other time I'm not, and you can see if you can guess which one I'm smiling on."
75,77,Lauren,"Excellent. Very handy this is a podcast, and we can't see what you're doing with your mouth."
75,78,Gretchen,Exactly. Number One: 'This is an example sentence.' Number Two: 'This is an example sentence.'
75,79,Lauren,"Oh my gosh, you were smiling on the second one."
75,80,Gretchen,I was.
75,81,Lauren,There was almost nothing else that was different. It was exactly the same intonation.
75,82,Gretchen,I was really trying so hard.
75,83,Lauren,"You were a very good experimental sentence-producer, but there was something different about that second sentence."
75,84,Gretchen,"Yeah, and that is that smiling seems to increase the pitch a little bit -- for all speakers -- and then for some speakers, it also makes things a little bit louder or a little bit more extremes between the highest and lowest pitch, and that they seem to be heard as smiling because smiling does change the shape of you mouth, and it changes the sounds as it comes out of it."
75,85,Lauren,"I guess when people say you should smile to sound like you're more enthusiastic, I should actually take that advice. It's pretty good advice. It checks out."
75,86,Gretchen,I guess so. Do you wanna hear what some other acoustic correlates of emotions are?
75,87,Lauren,Sure. Let's start with 'anger' to go for something very different.
75,88,Gretchen,"Right. First of all, there are two kinds of anger. You have cold anger and hot anger."
75,89,Lauren,"So, icy rage and spicy rage."
75,90,Gretchen,"Oh, I think so. Cold anger, that's a very stern anger, is produced with a lower pitch, higher intensity, and more energy, whereas hot anger, which is a blowing-your-top-off, losing-your-temper-type anger --"
75,91,Lauren,That's our spicy rage.
75,92,Gretchen,"That's our spicy rage -- is produced with a higher, more varied pitch, rather than being a low grumble is a higher, more varied pitch, and even greater energy than cold anger."
75,93,Lauren,"I never really thought about the fact that anger -- again, thinking about what emotions we pack into a single word, I never thought about the fact we have two very different things that we label as 'anger' but are expressed in our tone of voice very differently."
75,94,Gretchen,"Even though we're calling them both 'anger,' we have this sense of what these two varieties are and how to produce them differently. Then, fear is produced with a higher pitch, less variation in terms of up and down pitch variation, and lower energy, and a faster speech rate, which makes sense to me because you sort of [higher pitch] 'Uhhhhh fear.'"
75,95,Lauren,"Yeah. I like that it's a higher pitch like our hot anger, but it has lower energy. There're all these different parameters that we are manipulating when we show emotion in our voices."
75,96,Gretchen,"Then sadness is also produced with a higher pitch, less intensity, but more energy and more pauses of longer duration. But this seems to be English specific because there's also a Japanese study where speakers, especially female speakers, use a lower pitch for sadness. There may be also culturally specific aspects to some of these acoustic correlates of emotions."
75,97,Lauren,Just like we learn different words and different associations for those words across different cultures we also learn to express our emotions in different ways.
75,98,Gretchen,"And in ways that are legible to other people in our culture so that they recognise, yeah, this is spicy rage, or this is icy rage, or this is fear, or sadness, or something like that."
75,99,Lauren,"I assume even with the cultural differences, for spoken languages, we're still all operating with the one vocal tract, and signed languages, we're still all operating with the one body that's gonna respond to emotions in particular ways. I assume even though we've been mostly talking about English for those previous emotions, there are some patterns that occur across languages."
75,100,Gretchen,"Yeah. There's another study that compared how people identify emotions in three languages -- English, German, and Arabic -- and found that speakers of the other languages were still pretty good at identifying which emotion was being expressed in a phrase in a language they didn't understand. There're certainly some levels of cultural comparison here for sure."
75,101,Lauren,I feel like I can watch a film in a language I don't speak and know if someone is in a fit of spicy rage. That checks out for me.
75,102,Gretchen,"Yeah, I think so. The study that I find both very validating and very disturbing about how emotional tone of voice affects people is also based on how people perceive particular tones."
75,103,Lauren,"Okay, so we've talked about how there's this tendency to produce emotional tone of voice in a particular way, but that has an effect on the people that we are speaking to or that hear that use of speech."
75,104,Gretchen,"Right. This study was a very classic psych study paradigm, you know, you come into a lab, you have a computer screen, you have a voice telling you to press a particular button, one of two buttons, and the commands to press a particular button were said with either neutral prosody, happy prosody, or angry prosody."
75,105,Lauren,"Oh, no. No. that sounds very stressful."
75,106,Gretchen,"The angry voice tells you to press the red button, and you're like, 'Oh no!'"
75,107,Lauren,I feel very stressed thinking about this research paradigm.
75,108,Gretchen,"And then sometimes they would just vary up whether they give you the happy voice or the angry voice or the neutral voice sort of randomly, and then sometimes they'd give you the angry voice after you'd messed up pressing the previous button."
75,109,Lauren,"Oh no, this is very stressful."
75,110,Gretchen,"This is so stressful. Like, you've brought your participants into the lab to yell at them. They found that, sure enough, people do have slower responses to the angry prosody, and even slower responses when the angry prosody was given after they had previously messed up, and they actually thought the computer was kind of angry at them."
75,111,Lauren,People really are affected by tone of voice.
75,112,Gretchen,"Right. On the one hand, I find this study very stressful because, yeah, you're gonna bring your participants into the lab to yell at them. I hope they debriefed them and gave them a cookie afterwards or something."
75,113,Lauren,The thing that reassures me about university research is that it has to be cleared by a committee that look at the ethical implications of it. Doing this kind of work does require you to make sure your participants are okay afterwards.
75,114,Gretchen,"That's really reassuring, actually. But also, I feel kind of validated by this study because I think you do have an emotional reaction when someone says something to you in angry tone of voice that it's nice to know that other people are also feeling that, and you can measure it this very psychologically validated way. It's not just this feeling in the pit of your stomach, or this tightness in your chest isn't just 'Oh, this is me, and I shouldn't be having this reaction to this emotional tone of voice.' It's like, no, this is a normal human way to feel when someone is having an emotion at you is to feel an emotion in response -- and for that to affect your ability to respond to things."
75,115,Lauren,"I guess, also, a good reminder that when you are in a fit of spicy rage that you're having an effect on the people who are around you."
75,116,Gretchen,"Absolutely. That's one of the things that I find really validating about talking about emotions from a linguistic perspective. The fact that there are all these words for emotions reminds us that we're not alone, that other people have had and labelled and shared feelings like ours before. Sometimes, it's finding the right life experience or the right labels for our feelings, and sometimes just thinking about the linguistics of emotion words reminds us that we don't have to be alone with our feelings. We can feel more connected with other people by talking about them whether that's in a private journal or diary, whether that's reading about other people's emotions or experiencing them through media like movies and music, or simply by thinking about the words that we use and how they connect us with other people who've also used them.

76,1,Gretchen,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics! I'm Gretchen McCulloch."
76,2,Gretchen,"I'm Lauren Gawne. Today, we're getting enthusiastic about language names. But first, we're doing another Lingthusiasm liveshow for 2023. The liveshow will once again be on the Lingthusiasm Patreon Discord, and it will be on the 18th or 19th of February, depending on your time zone."
76,3,Gretchen,"We're really excited to be returning to one of fan favourite topics and answering your questions about language and gender with a returning special guest, Dr. Kirby Conrod, who you may remember from the very popular episode about the grammar of 'singular they.' We're bringing them back for more informal discussion, which you can participate in. If you're a Lingthusiasm patron, you can ask questions or share your examples and anecdotes about gender in various languages via Patreon or in the AMA questions channel on Discord. We might mention some of them in the episode. Or bring your questions and comments along to the liveshow itself."
76,4,Lauren,The Lingthusiasm Discord is available for all patrons at the Lingthusiast tier and above. You can join the Lingthusiasm Patreon by visiting lingthusiasm.com/patreon. That tier also allows you access to our monthly bonus episodes.

76,7,Gretchen,There's this really fun group activity that you sometimes see in linguistics classes or when linguists are hanging out which is collaboratively brainstorming all of the languages that people in the group can think of.
76,8,Lauren,"Ooo, yeah."
76,9,Gretchen,"Especially if you don't allow Google or Wikipedia, it's just which languages have you heard of or do you know at least a word or phrase in and can you put them on a whiteboard or in a notebook."
76,10,Lauren,"Hmm, I'm already finding this a little bit complicated because I never know what name to give some of the languages that I know or know of or work with."
76,11,Gretchen,What's an example of that?
76,12,Lauren,"Okay. I wrote my PhD thesis about some parts of the grammar of a language called 'Yolmo.' I worked with a variety that's spoken in an area of Nepal called Lamjung, so that's known as 'Lamjung Yolmo.' The other variety is just called 'Yolmo' because that's where the Lamjung people migrated from. But it's also known thanks to some savvy branding in the '70s as 'Helambu Sherpa.' It's not related to the Sherpa near Everest at all, directly, but they wanted to get associated with the trekking tourism, so they took that name as an outside name for a while. That's already, like, three names for what is really one language."
76,13,Gretchen,And you've also worked on a language called 'Syuba.'
76,14,Lauren,"Well, that's true. But Syuba is actually closely related to these varieties of Yolmo. It's spoken in an area called 'Ramechhap,' but it's not called 'Ramechhap Yolmo.' They've only just returned to asking people to call them 'Syuba.' Before, they were called 'Kagate,' which is seen as a little bit of an unpleasant name. They don't like it anymore. It's like the Nepali word/name for them. Again, there's two or three different possible names for this group of people who speak this particular language."
76,15,Gretchen,These are all names that're used for them in English. Do they call themselves these names in the language itself?
76,16,Lauren,"Syuba speakers call themselves 'Syuba.' They've asked other people to. But actually, when you talk to people, and you're talking about language, they just refer to it as 'tam,' which is the word for 'language.' In fact, it's the word for 'language' in a lot of different Tibetan varieties. A lot of people will just refer to what they speak as 'tam' or 'language.' Just another name to potentially throw in there."
76,17,Gretchen,"I remember when I was first reading about the different language work that you were doing on your blog being like, 'Wait, how many languages does this person speak?' because I think the language names were in the process of changing, and so it looked like you had written something about Kagate and also something about Syuba, but those were actually the same language."
76,18,Lauren,"It's a constantly evolving situation. I will always, always defer to the communities I work with as to what they wish to be called but also keeping track of this history is really interesting as you see the relationship between different groups of people evolve and change. We're kind of at one or two languages, and I've already got six or eight names going on here. Our whiteboard is gonna get very complicated very quickly."
76,19,Gretchen,"Well, that's the interesting level of complexity because, like how humans sometimes have multiple names on different types of pieces of identification or at different periods of their lives, languages can also go through several different names. It's even more complicated because there are generally multiple members of the community; sometimes they'll have different opinions."
76,20,Lauren,"Sometimes, those opinions are tied up with really interesting or really complicated or really difficult histories. We can't just pin a single label to a group of people that speak a particular language."
76,21,Gretchen,"Another thing that can make language-naming complicated is, depending on how one tries to draw the boundaries between, okay, these two communities are speaking the same language, they're speaking varieties of one language, or they're speaking languages that we're gonna call 'different,' which also factors into a lot of political- and community-level and linguistic decision making."
76,22,Lauren,"We have a very Western perspective on what we think a group of people or a collection of language-speakers should be. There's this really great paper that was recently published about language-naming practices in Indigenous Australia from Jill Vaughan, Ruth Singer, and Murray Garde. They looked at how the social attitudes towards language and ownership of language and relationships between peoples creates this really different approach to how to think about names of languages. In Australia, what is really important is the connection between language and a particular land and the geographic relationship that exists there, and therefore, who has the right to speak a language, who has the right to speak a language in a particular place or at a particular time, is a very different attitude to what we might have as, say, 'I'm an English speaker. You can be an English speaker, too. We all speak English wherever we go.'"
76,23,Gretchen,Both of us live in countries that have this history of colonisation where English isn't originally tied to either of the lands that we're occupying.
76,24,Lauren,"The authors in this paper spend a lot of time talking through the example of 'Bininj Kunwok,' which is a language from the northern part of Australia, which exists as a language name. It's a language name people recognise. There's a grammar and a dictionary. The name itself is, in these languages, the word for 'person,' 'bininj,' and 'kunwok,' 'speech,' so a bit like Yolmo with 'tam' -- similar elements coming into the language name there."
76,25,Gretchen,"This is like, 'the people's language,' or something like that?"
76,26,Lauren,"Yeah. 'The people who speak this language' kind of thing. People are very happy to use this term and come together as a group to work, say, on a dictionary project or some language materials, but actually, there're many, many groups within that cluster of Bininj Kunwok that have their own name for their own variety of the language, who have names for all the other varieties, who don't see themselves as necessarily speaking the same language because they're not necessarily from the same part of the country. This creates this different relationship to where the language boundary is in the name compared to, say, English, where we see ourselves as all speaking just English."
76,27,Gretchen,"So, this is sort of language name as a political alliance or federation of languages. I mean, actually, now that I'm saying this, I don't know how dissimilar this is to using English to refer to all of the different varieties of English around the world in the sense that they have certain alliances when it comes to, especially, written material but also a lot of local differences on the ground that sometimes get erased by thinking of them all as having a common, standardised written form."
76,28,Lauren,Absolutely. I think the situation when we zoom in on any particular context is always more nuanced. This paper really goes into a lot of the context and the nuance of how we've come to have these language groups and these language names in Australia that can sometimes simplify a really complex social dynamic or a social history.
76,29,Gretchen,"One of the other things I enjoyed about this paper was from the references portion at the beginning talking about how a language often gains wider public acknowledgement through 'artefactualisation,' such as the creation of a dictionary or grammar, that makes for sort of a birth certificate of a language, as distinct from the language itself. Like, here it's got its driver's license. We're using this driver's license as a form of quote-unquote 'neutral' ID to prove that a person exists when, actually, not all humans have equal access to documentation like driver's licenses and birth certificates. There're other things that a driver's license, especially, signify in addition to being an ID marker. Not everyone can drive or is gonna be able to learn to drive or is physically able to drive. The idea that dictionaries and grammars get treated as evidence that a language exists, even when they have these very different relationships to different groups of language speakers or language signers, that's a metaphor that carries through."
76,30,Lauren,"Again, we're trying to use language names as a way to pin things down, but when we actually zoom in, the situation is always a lot more nuanced. Just like we can get distracted sometimes by the fact that people share a name, not all languages that appear to have very similar names are necessarily part of the same family of languages. One that always tricked me up when I started working in Nepal is that we have 'Nepali Bhasa' and 'Nepal Bhasa.'"
76,31,Gretchen,"As someone who doesn't know anything about Nepal, this really sounds very similar, yes. 'Nepali Bhasa' and 'Nepal Bhasa.'"
76,32,Lauren,"'Nepali Bhasa' is the Indo-Aryan language that's the national language of Nepal. It's very closely related to Hindi. 'Nepal Bhasa' is the Newar languages that are the original languages of the Kathmandu Valley, so that's the capital of Nepal."
76,33,Gretchen,"So, they're not part of this broader Indo-European language family that Hindi and Nepal belong to?"
76,34,Lauren,"No, they're actually part of the Tibeto-Burman family. They're part of a completely different family. They were in the Kathmandu Valley before the Indo-Aryan speakers came in to make it the capital of an even bigger country, which is what we now know as the country of Nepal today."
76,35,Gretchen,"'Bhasa' sort of sounds like another language term, which is 'Bhasa Indonesia,' the Indonesian language, or 'Bahasa Malaya,' the Malay language."
76,36,Lauren,"Yeah, that /basa/ or /bhasa/ is an old Sanskrit word for 'language,' and so it pops up all over the place even for languages that aren't related to each other."
76,37,Gretchen,This is great. I just learned a word that means 'language' in a whole bunch of languages that've been influenced by Sanskrit.
76,38,Lauren,"Yeah, we're definitely collecting words for 'language' in this episode as much as we're collecting language names. It comes part and parcel with the territory."
76,39,Gretchen,"This does tell us something about the relationships of these languages to each other which is, I guess, they were all influenced by Sanskrit at some level even if they have many other differences between them."
76,40,Lauren,Indeed.
76,41,Gretchen,Another group of languages with very similar names that have a shared history even if not necessarily a shared linguistic trajectory is the group of creole languages.
76,42,Lauren,"Oh, yeah."
76,43,Gretchen,"When I say, 'creole,' what's the first creole language that you think of?"
76,44,Lauren,"Um, 'Kriol,' spelt K-R-I-O-L, which is a language of Australia, especially up across the Northern Territory in Western Australia, heading towards Bininj Kunwok country. It's a creole of the English that came in but also from across the local languages around there, around the Roper River area, but it's also spread to other parts of Australia as well. That's the first creole that comes to mind for me. What about for you?"
76,45,Gretchen,"I think the first creole language that I think of is Haitian Creole, which is also often referred to just as 'Kreyòl,' but in this case spelled K-R-E-Y-O-L with an accent on the O. This is the language of Haiti which is descended from French. It's also spoken in the context of displacement and colonisation and having a bunch of people losing some connections with their linguistic roots, but they don't have a common ancestor except insofar as English and French have a common ancestor. They just have this common history of being this contact language in terms of what 'creole' refers to."
76,46,Lauren,I find it so fascinating that this word 'creole' has this long history and in certain places has become attached to particular languages that arise in these situations. And in other places it refers to maybe the people or the food from the area. 'Creole' pops up in a lot of places where you've seen French or English colonisation.
76,47,Gretchen,"There're also creoles that are extended to other languages that aren't linked to colonisation. There's Portuguese-based creoles, Dutch-based creoles, German-based creoles, Spanish-based creoles, Arabic-, Malay-based creoles. There's a variety of places you could have a creole. Many of them, but not all of them, are linked to the Transatlantic slave trade and forced displacement of people from a location. You had a variety of people from different linguistic backgrounds mixing -- not with their consent -- and making this combination language with a language they had in common was the colonial language but also bringing in influences from their various mother tongues."
76,48,Lauren,"Obviously, the Transatlantic slave trade wasn't relevant to Australia, which is not near the Atlantic Ocean, but similar factors around displacement and the bringing in of English as a dominant language of trade and commerce in people's lives. We also have Yumplatok in Australia, which is a creole language of the part of Northern Queensland that heads up into Papua New Guinea."
76,49,Gretchen,"And Tok Pisin is another creole language -- and English-derived creole -- of Papua New Guinea, which isn't referred to by the name of 'Creole,' like many of them are."
76,50,Lauren,"But the 'tok' in both of those is from English 'talk.' Once again, another-language-vibe name as part of the name of a language there."
76,51,Gretchen,"Another language that came about because of contact and colonialisation with a bit of a different history is Michif or Metis in Canada, which arose from French fur traders marrying local Cree women. Their kids spoke this language that has a combination of French and Cree using Cree verbs, which are a really interesting and complex system that have lots of prefixes and suffixes. Cree is an Algonquian language, and this is characteristic of Algonquian languages. And then French nouns, which are also sort of the more complex bit of French grammar where French nouns have all of this grammatical gender going on. These kids decided to learn the most featurally rich bits of both of their parents' languages."
76,52,Lauren,"Amazing that these children made this language out of the complicated verbs and the complicated nouns. But it also has two names, you said, Metis or Michif."
76,53,Gretchen,"Yeah. The name of this people and this language is Metis or Michif, which comes from a local pronunciation variant of the word 'métis,' which is from a French word that means 'mixed,' but it doesn't refer to any type of linguistic mixing where you could have two parents from different language backgrounds. It refers to this particular mixing that happened in this particular historical context."
76,54,Lauren,That makes sense that the language name takes on this specific meaning and refers to this specific linguistic context.
76,55,Gretchen,"I think with language names, sometimes something that comes up with a language name is its etymology, you know, 'This comes from a particular language,' or 'This comes from a particular meaning,' but also etymology isn't destiny when it comes to language names."
76,56,Lauren,"Yeah. I always find it really fun to say, 'Ooo, this part of the language name comes from the word for 'language'' or the word for 'talk' or the word for 'people.' But a language is so much more than the literal parts of its name."
76,57,Gretchen,"I guess the other point is etymology is an interesting thing to learn about, but what's important is respecting the wishes of the community that has that particular language. One of the things that I've been following is names of Bantu languages because a lot of them seem to come in pairs. Sometimes you see 'Swahili' in a list. Sometimes you see 'Kiswahili.' Sometimes you see 'Zulu.' Sometimes you see 'Isizulu.' Sometimes you see 'Sotho' and 'Sesotho' or 'Tswana' and 'Setswana.,' 'Congo' and 'Kikongo.' A lot of these language names seem to come in pairs like that where one of them has this prefix that's something like /ki-/ or /si-/ or /t͡ʃi-/."
76,58,Lauren,"I know that Setswana is spoken in Botswana, and Sesotho is spoken in Lesotho. They're all connected somehow. This marking of something is a language by the use of a prefix is something that happens across these languages. They're all part of the Bantu language family."
76,59,Gretchen,"Right. And Bantu languages are known for having prefixes that mark lots of things. I dunno if it's settled whether in English people are more likely to use the language prefix to refer to the language or not. It seems to sometimes vary per language. I mostly see people talking about 'Kinyarwanda,' the language of Rwanda, which includes the prefix, but I also often hear people talking about 'Zulu' rather than 'Isizulu' without the prefix. I don't know if there's a consensus across different groups here, or if it's something that varies more locally."
76,60,Lauren,I guess that just kind of works how an '-ish' or and '-ese' suffix works in English. We have '-ish' suffixes like 'English' and 'Danish' and 'Irish.'
76,61,Gretchen,"Yeah, or '-ese' suffixes like 'Japanese,' 'Cantonese,' 'Portuguese.' These can also get applied to novel contexts to refer to the concept of a language in general -- something like 'Simlish,' the language of the Sims."
76,62,Lauren,"Oh, yeah. Or 'Legalese.'"
76,63,Gretchen,Or 'Journalese.'
76,64,Lauren,"I guess there is an older tendency to refer to 'Nepali' as 'Nepalese' as a language. Now, you are more likely to see it written as 'Nepali,' so taking their preference for the name as it's pronounced closer to their own use of the name rather than this English suffixised form."
76,65,Gretchen,Sometimes the move closer towards how a community identifies themself happens at the morphological level where the suffix or the prefix changes as well.
76,66,Lauren,This distinction between what a group of people refer to their own language as and how a language is referred to by people outside of the group is often quite different as we've discussed with a few examples so far.
76,67,Gretchen,"I think the first example that I learned of names for languages being really different in the language versus from other people who speak the language was in German, which in French, which I was learning very early, is 'Allemand.' and then in German itself, is 'Deutsch.' All three of these were really different from each other."
76,68,Lauren,"In Italian it's 'Tedesco,' and in Polish it's 'Niemiecki.' These are all very different."
76,69,Gretchen,"These are all very different. Something like 'English' to 'Anglais' in French, I was like, yeah, I sort of see how that happens. You hold it loosely and see how it's similar. But 'German' to 'Deutsch' to Allemand' to --"
76,70,Lauren,'Niemiecki' to 'Tedesco.'
76,71,Gretchen,These all sound really different to each other.
76,72,Lauren,"Part of this is that Germany as a country and German as a unified language is a relatively recent construction in Western and European history, so each of these groups were using names for whatever the German closest to them was and have kept those names as Germany unified."
76,73,Gretchen,"Right. There's different Germanic tribes or Germanic peoples that were referred to by different names in different areas. The broader name for this phenomenon of the name of a language inside its own group and outside of its own group is a contrast between the 'endonym,' the name inside, and the 'exonym,' the name from outside."
76,74,Lauren,The '-nym' part there being 'name' and 'endo-' and 'exo-' being a contrasting pair.
76,75,Gretchen,Right. That's '-nym' as in 'pseudonym' or 'synonym.'
76,76,Lauren,'Antonym.'
76,77,Gretchen,'Endonym' and 'exonym' being themselves antonyms.
76,78,Lauren,Indeed. 'Endo-' and 'exo-' pop up in a whole variety of other places as well. We have 'exoplanets' which are planets outside of our solar system.
76,79,Gretchen,Does this mean that planets inside our solar system are technically 'endoplanets'?
76,80,Lauren,"Hmm, maybe technically, yeah, just like we have 'exoskeletons' like lobsters or Super Mecha Warriors."
76,81,Gretchen,"Wait, so we could also have 'endoskeletons,' which is what humans have which is a skeleton inside our body?"
76,82,Lauren,"Yeah, I'm gonna start referring to it as my 'endoskeleton' now."
76,83,Gretchen,"I think it's funny because 'endo-' and 'exo-' are so clearly opposites. But 'endo-' is familiar to me less from 'endoplanets' and more from words like 'endocrine system,' which is your hormones."
76,84,Lauren,"Ah, I guess that is that 'endo-'."
76,85,Gretchen,I looked up whether there is also an 'exocrine system.'
76,86,Lauren,Is there?
76,87,Gretchen,"Yeah. The endocrine system are the stuff that gets secreted inside your body and the exocrine system is all the stuff that you secrete outside your body, like sweat and saliva and mucus."
76,88,Lauren,"I guess also in medicine we have 'endoscopes,' which is when you use a camera in an orifice of your body to look at some internal part of your body."
76,89,Gretchen,This is like when you'd put a camera down your throat to look at your vocal cords.
76,90,Lauren,Yeah. I guess an 'exoscope' is just any normal camera you take a selfie with because it's looking at the outside of your body.
76,91,Gretchen,Great. I'm gonna refer to my normal camera as an 'exoscope' now.
76,92,Lauren,"An 'endonym' is the name that we have in our own language for our language, and an 'exonym' is the name that we have for a language of some other group of people."
76,93,Gretchen,"To go back to the German example, 'Deutsch' is the endonym, and then 'Tedesco' and 'Allemand' and 'German' and 'Niemiecki' are all exonyms for 'German' coming from the perspective of various other languages."
76,94,Lauren,"We've seen some recurring motifs already in terms of endonyms, people using words like 'talk' or 'language' or 'people' for reference to their own language, but there're also lots of different types of exonyms as well."
76,95,Gretchen,"Sometimes, when a community wants to change the name of their language, that sometimes means replacing certain exonyms that other communities are using for their language with something that's closer to the endonym of how they're referring to themselves, which is especially important if this particular community hasn't had a lot of self-determination in the first place. I don't think I know any Germans who are like, 'Yeah, no, English speakers need to refer to us as 'Deutsch',' but that's a reflection of German social status, which is not the same if you're from a language where there's been this long history of colonisation."
76,96,Lauren,"One type of exonym that can sometimes be easy to spot in the wild is when the name for the language as an exonym is very similar to their own endonym. For example, we call Italian, 'Italian,' and in Italian it is 'Italiano.'"
76,97,Gretchen,"Right, which is really similar. Sometimes, it's just the languages don't have quite the same sounds. The vowels in Italian are gonna be different from the vowels in English, and so 'Italian' versus 'Italiano' is produced with slightly different vowels even though the spelling is quite similar."
76,98,Lauren,"These are cognate because it's the same word just pronounced in each of the respective languages. Sometimes, these cognates can be a little bit more hidden."
76,99,Gretchen,"Yeah. Like, 'Tedesco' in Italian is actually from the same origin as the German word 'Deutsch.' It also gives us the English 'Teutonic.'"
76,100,Lauren,"Ah, right."
76,101,Gretchen,"It's just that those words ended up with diverging trajectories in those languages. One place where you have a lot of adaptation for pronunciation differences is if the languages have different modalities. If you have a sign language, and you wanna refer to it in a spoken language, you need a spoken name to refer to it and vice versa, you need a signed name to refer to a spoken language."
76,102,Lauren,"I think this is why a lot of signed languages end up having acronym-type names, so 'American Sign Language,' 'ASL,' 'British Sign Language,' 'BSL,' because there isn't a direct way to take the cognate from the signed language into the spoken language."
76,103,Gretchen,"Actually, that raises a question for me which is 'Auslan' which has, I think, a relatively straightforward etymology, 'Australia' and 'language,' but it doesn't have that acronymic thing. I guess it would just be 'ASL' for 'Australian Sign Language' which would be confusing. Do you know how that came about?"
76,104,Lauren,"In the 1970s and '80s when Trevor Johnston started working on Auslan, it already had a name in Auslan. It has its own sign. But Trevor Johnston needed a way to refer to it in English as well. He actually took inspiration from what was happening in America at the time, which is that what we now know as ASL was also being quite commonly referred to as 'Ameslan' -- so a blend instead of an acronym."
76,105,Gretchen,"Of like, 'American Sign Language' -- oh, the S there is for 'sign.' 'Ameslan.' Okay."
76,106,Lauren,Yeah.
76,107,Gretchen,"So, the S in 'Auslan' is also for 'sign' rather than 'Aus' as in 'Australia."
76,108,Lauren,"It's a bit of both. And I think that's why it's really stood the test of time because it really has a very word feel. As you said, it also would have to compete with 'ASL' for recognition in that three-letter acronym approach. 'Auslan' has stood the test of time in a way that 'Ameslan' hasn't."
76,109,Gretchen,"That's interesting. I think that when I think of other linguistic varieties that have acronymic names, I think of accents and dialects and varieties that've been named in the last, maybe, century or so."
76,110,Lauren,"Acronym-ing is a very 20th Century approach, for sure."
76,111,Gretchen,"20th and 21st, I guess. Things like 'MLE,' 'Multicultural London English,' or 'RP,' 'Received Pronunciation,' or 'AAVE,' 'AAE,' 'AAL,' which is 'African American Vernacular English,' 'African American English,' 'African American Language,' depending on how you wanna name it -- these are all very acronymic names for things that have been named comparatively recently, whereas some of the older English varieties, I'm thinking things like 'Cockney,' which is associated with the working class in London's East End, or like 'Scouse' in Liverpool, these have names that aren't acronymic. These are varieties that have been named for a longer period of time."
76,112,Lauren,It's interesting how the way that we talk about different languages and different varieties reflects larger trends in approaches to naming things.
76,113,Gretchen,"Another way that language names can come about is by doing a more direct or a partial translation of the name for the language in the language. An example of this is 'Light Walpiri,' which is a mixed language of Australia that has Indigenous Walpiri language, Kriol, and Standard Australian English as its parent languages. The name 'Light Walpiri,' which I'd encountered in a few contexts because it made some news when the linguist named Carmel O'Shannessy was documenting it initially, I was interested to read in one of the papers that the name comes from 'Walpiri rampaku,' which literally means in Walpiri 'light Walpiri.' She as a linguist decided to translate part of the name into English while keeping the connection with how people were referring to it in the language -- or possibly speakers were doing that, but it has this connection to how people were talking about it without being a direct reflection of it."
76,114,Lauren,"So, that exonym that is the way that I know the language is a direct translation of their endonym for it within Walpiri. Interesting. I never knew the history of 'Light Walpiri.'"
76,115,Gretchen,"I was wondering why 'light,' and that seems to be why."
76,116,Lauren,"Sometimes, the exonym that we use in one language was borrowed as the exonym from another language. So, we didn't borrow someone's endonym or own way of talking about their language, we borrowed it from, maybe, their neighbours."
76,117,Gretchen,"This is really common in the North American Indigenous context. There are loads and loads of examples. One of them is the name 'Navajo,' which comes from a Tewa word, which is another Indigenous language spoken nearby, 'navahu,' which combines the word 'nava,' meaning field, and 'hu,' meaning 'valley,' to mean 'large field.' It was borrowed from Tewa into Spanish to refer to a particular place, and then later into English for the people and their language. But the name that the people themselves use is Diné, which also means 'people,' with the language known as 'Diné bizaad' or 'people's language,' or sometimes 'Naabeehó bizaad,' but 'Naabeehó' is this adaptation of the word 'Navajo' because there's not actually any V in Diné."
76,118,Lauren,Always a bit of giveaway when the exonym has sounds in it that don't exist in the language it's referring to.
76,119,Gretchen,"Really big one. In this case, 'field' and 'valley,' that's got a relatively neutral valence. It's not the name in their own language, but it's not a particularly bad thing to be people in a field or a valley. But a lot of these names from neighbours are sometimes pretty pejorative."
76,120,Lauren,"That is definitely a large theme in exonyms, especially when it's not the group itself that got to determine how they were referred to by outsiders. It's part of why Kagate speakers moved to calling themselves 'Syuba' even though both of those names refer to their previous occupation as paper-makers, which was seen as not a very aspirational career in the social hierarchy of Nepal. They've taken a lot more pride in their own word for that name rather than for the Nepali word which has more immediate negative connotations for Nepali speakers. It took me a long time to make the connection between the Slavic language family and the word that we have from originally Greek and then Latin into modern languages as 'slave.' These two words are actually cognate with each other."
76,121,Gretchen,Oh boy. Okay. Is there a sense of which one arouse first?
76,122,Lauren,"I felt like I got conflicting and slightly-confusing-and-lost-to-history stories depending on the etymological dictionary I looked up but definitely seemed to be pretty cognate, and it says something about the social status of speakers of those languages within, definitely, the Roman Empire."
76,123,Gretchen,"That's for sure a thing. This is also really common when it comes to Indigenous languages that a lot of their names are pejoratives. I'm not necessarily sure that I wanna repeat a whole bunch of pejoratives of what the names are. People are trying to bury them. I think my go-to example that's comparatively a relatively mild pejorative is the name 'Maliseet,' which is a language spoken around Eastern Canada and North-Eastern United States, also sometimes called 'Passamaquoddy.' I grew up with that just being the name for the language, but then I learned later that this actually comes from a name by the Mi'kmaq people, who are another Indigenous group that's slightly further east in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island and around there, who were encountered by Europeans slightly earlier. They were asked, 'Who lives over there?', and gave the name 'Maliseet,' which means, 'They speak slowly.'"
76,124,Lauren,Charming.
76,125,Gretchen,"Sort of makes some sense when you think of, they speak related languages, maybe if they're talking to each other, they're trying to come to some understanding and speak slowly to each other. But it's not super flattering, and it's a word that people have understandably been moving away from in more recent years."
76,126,Lauren,"I mean, I only know it as 'Passamaquoddy,' so it's an indication that the exonym that's now in use is the one that the Passamaquoddy actually prefer."
76,127,Gretchen,"There's another exonym which I, unfortunately, haven't been able to find a good pronunciation guide of online that begins with a W and translates as meaning, 'people of the bright river' or 'of the shining river.' There's still several different endonyms that this is under discussion for, but this is one case of very, very many, some of which are much more insulting."
76,128,Lauren,It gives you a sense of the history of power dynamics in general.
76,129,Gretchen,"There's an interesting case of miscommunication when it comes to the Mi'kmaq language itself because this was a case where a First Nations people and European people were encountering each other mutually for the first time in what's now Eastern Canada. The name 'Mi'kmaq' is an exonym which literally means in Mi'kmaq 'my friends and family' or 'my kin friends,' so it implicitly in the answer to 'Who lives around here?', well, it's like, 'My friends and family live around here.'"
76,130,Lauren,Wonderfully literal.
76,131,Gretchen,"Yeah. I mean, which, fair enough, really. The endonym is 'Lnu,' 'Lnu'i'sit,' 'the people's language.' But since the exonym isn't insulting and the endonym sounds a lot like a related Indigenous language that's spoken a little further north, 'Inu,' at the moment, the exonym is still in use in English because it's still a word in the language and has this history. Conversely, the name in Mi'kmaq for 'French,' the French people and the French language, is 'Wenju' or 'Wenjuwi'sit,' which is 'He or she speaks French,' which literally translates to something like, 'Who are they?'"
76,132,Lauren,"That is amazing. So, these French people turned up, and they're like, 'Who are they?'"
76,133,Gretchen,"Basically, yeah. It's got this sort of interestingly mutual miscommunication, whereas the Mi'kmaq word for 'English' is 'Agase'wit,' 'He or she speaks English,' which is clearly borrowed from French, so you can see the contact via French. But when it comes to the paired miscommunication, I find it an interesting story of contact."
76,134,Lauren,I always find power dynamics are really interesting for who is centred as the default speaker or what is centred as the default language.
76,135,Gretchen,"When it comes to the colonial context those languages are often named after the country they were originally spoken in. But I was at a conference a while back, and I met a linguist from Brazil and said, 'Oh, you speak Portuguese,' and he said, 'Well, you know, I like to call it 'European Brazilian'.'"
76,136,Lauren,That's amazing. Especially considering there are far more Brazilian speakers of Portuguese than there are those in Europe who speak Portuguese.
76,137,Gretchen,Yeah. And it sort of raises the question of could you generalise this in other contexts.
76,138,Lauren,Do you think that maybe I should start telling people that in the UK they speak 'protipodean' Australian?
76,139,Gretchen,"Oh god, it's like 'antipodean' but 'protipodean' Australian. You know what? I'll buy it."
76,140,Lauren,I'm gonna start trying to get grants to document protipodean Australian so we can go back and hang out with people in the UK.
76,141,Gretchen,"I look forward to seeing the Reviewer 2 comments on that application, thank you."
76,142,Lauren,"Maybe at some point in the future, languages like Brazilian Portuguese will find new ways of talking about themselves or asking to be referred to. Jokes aside, language names are in flux, and they tell us a lot about history, but they're not set in stone. We can change the way we refer to languages."
76,143,Gretchen,"Right. Linguists have this responsibility, if someone's in charge of making the types of documentation that make a language visible to bureaucratic infrastructure to be very thoughtful in talking with multiple people about how that language name is decided."
76,144,Lauren,I think we all have a responsibility to keep in mind that language names can change and can have complicated histories. The thing we can do is always respect the choices of the people who speak those languages when it comes to the names they're given. [Music]

77,1,Gretchen,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics! I'm Gretchen McCulloch. I'm here with Woon Fei Ting who's a Research Associate and the Lab Manager at the Brain, Language & Intersensory Perception Lab at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. Today, we're getting enthusiastic about kids in multilingual environments. We'd like to extend a huge thanks to Dr. Suzy Styles, who heads the BLIP lab at NTU, for hosting me in Singapore! Check out our interview with Suzy about which words sound spiky across languages. See the link in the show notes. But first, some announcements. We're doing another Lingthusiasm liveshow just a few days after this episode goes up. The liveshow is online at 4:00 p.m. on February the 18th, for me in Montreal, or 8:00 a.m. on the 19th for Lauren in Melbourne, 2023. Follow the link in the show notes fore more time zones. This liveshow is a Q&A about language and gender with returning special guest, Dr. Kirby Conrod. You may remember Kirby from their very popular episode about the grammar of 'singular they,' so we're bringing them back for more informal discussion which you can participate in. You can ask your language and gender-y questions or share your examples and stories in the comments on Patreon or in the AMA questions channel on Discord in advance or bring them along to the liveshow. You can join the Lingthusiasm liveshow by becoming a patron at the Lingthusiast tier or higher.

77,2,Gretchen,"Hello, Fei Ting, welcome to the show!"
77,3,Fei Ting,"Hi, thanks for having me. This is the first time I'm doing any kind of interview and the first time being on a podcast."
77,4,Gretchen,Amazing! We're excited to be your very first time. Can we start with the question that we ask all of our guests? How did you get into linguistics?
77,5,Fei Ting,"My younger sibling was diagnosed with dyslexia when she was maybe around the age of 9 or 10, then she started going for English language classes to help her spell. That was when my older sibling and I started realising that we display a lot of the same quote-unquote 'symptoms,' or we have the same struggles. I started doing a little bit of reading and got really interested in this idea of, oh, maybe we're all dyslexic, but then she got a diagnosis because it was a lot more prominent, or it came out a lot more in her day-to-day schooling. Later on in high school, my high school is right next to a school for children with cerebral palsy. I would go over once a week to be a teaching assistant to help out if the teachers need any help. One of the things that we did was to bring the children to their speech therapy sessions. The speech therapist there at that time was a very nice lady. She was from India. She was teaching some of these children how to pronounce particular consonants or vowel sounds as best as they could. She spoke with a really heavy accent. I thought to myself, 'Well, these children are Singaporean children, and they're receiving speech therapy in an accent that is unfamiliar to them' --"
77,6,Gretchen,"Yeah, is this gonna be any use for them?"
77,7,Fei Ting,"Yeah, and they are -- well, a lot of them have a lot of, as you can imagine, modal difficulties, some of them with language development difficulties. When they mimic, they also mimic the accent as well."
77,8,Gretchen,"So, they're gonna be mimicking her accent, which is a perfectly fine accent to have but not what the rest of their family and community have."
77,9,Fei Ting,"Yeah. At that time, I was just thinking about, okay, this is a cool job. I had never come across speech therapy before in my life. I didn't even know what it was. So, when I first learned about it, I thought, 'Wow, that's really cool!' But at the same time, I also thought, 'Maybe this is what I wanna do in the future.' I set out looking at which universities to go to, what do I have to do to become a speech therapist. It led me on to this path of going to university for linguistics, and then I taught for a little bit. I taught for about 4 years."
77,10,Gretchen,Teaching what?
77,11,Fei Ting,"Teaching English after graduation. In between, I did some volunteering work, and I looked at the overall job market for speech therapy in Singapore. The thing about it in Singapore is a lot of our speech therapists don't really get to do a lot of speech therapy per se."
77,12,Gretchen,"Oh, that seems like it's not the thing you came into the job for."
77,13,Fei Ting,"A lot of them end up doing elderly care, swallowing therapy with patients that might have suffered from a stroke."
77,14,Gretchen,But you were excited about working with kids.
77,15,Fei Ting,Yeah. I was told by almost every speech therapist that there isn't that much focus on research right now because they are hoping that a lot of people just graduate with a master's in speech therapy and then go work in a hospital. Then you will likely not be working with children.
77,16,Gretchen,"I guess there's the question of like, what are Singaporean children quote-unquote 'expected' to be able to do at a certain age or is there even research on what their typically developing peers would be able to do in this context that would help you devise therapy programmes for kids."
77,17,Fei Ting,"At that point, no. I think right now as well -- this is the current work that we're doing, right, looking at children growing up in Singapore, which is a really multilingual environment. The documentation of regular kids, we don't have good documentation of that yet, and therefore, you can think about how, for children that have some sort of language delay or developmental disorders, we don't have therapy that might be tailored to our variety of English and the other languages that we speak here."
77,18,Gretchen,"I feel like something that I've heard from people in more monolingual or monolingual-ish language environments in Canada/the US is 'Oh, well, my sibling got diagnosed with dyslexia or something, and so my parents stopped speaking our heritage language to the kid because they thought it would confuse them, and they did only English.' We know that lots of people are multilingual, and this is fine, but there isn't a good amount of knowledge about what does it look like to develop in a multilingual environment where this is normal and expected and everyone is doing this. It would cause difficulties to not be able to function in that multilingual space because you can't talk to your grandparents, or you can't talk to people in some stores that you go into. That's also part of what you need for functioning in a language is having access to multiple language spaces."
77,19,Fei Ting,"That's exactly right. In Singapore -- well, I think this is unfortunate -- some of the children who are diagnosed with dyslexia earlier on, they will be given recommendations to not do the -- well, we call it here the 'mother tongue languages,' which in schools are taught as Mandarin Chinese, Malay, or Tamil. The recommendation is, well, don't do your mother tongue language as a subject."
77,20,Gretchen,"Only do English, and that's it."
77,21,Fei Ting,"Only do English, yeah, which as you mentioned, it then becomes difficult for the child to converse with people around them or their family members who might not be using English."
77,22,Gretchen,"Right. Because the norm of the research that's been happening on kids with various developmental disabilities has been doing it on monolingual populations, which then makes it seem like you need to be monolingual in order to benefit from the various kinds of therapies that people do."
77,23,Fei Ting,"The common misconception is, if you're already struggling in one, and that one language is usually English, then let's not burden your brain with a second one. But languages are so different. Mandarin Chinese is radically different compared to English both in the way it looks as well as the structure, so processing of Mandarin Chinese is also different. There isn't enough research right now to support saying that a child who is English-Mandarin bilingual will benefit from not having to do Mandarin as a subject in school."
77,24,Gretchen,"I mean, the brain is very flexible, very plastic, and so the things you make the brain do, it almost makes me wonder if being exposed to more languages would help because you're giving the brain more practice in doing language stuff, but I dunno if there's data on this."
77,25,Fei Ting,"Well, we don't know enough."
77,26,Gretchen,But you're not currently a speech therapist.
77,27,Fei Ting,"No, I'm not."
77,28,Gretchen,"You work in a language lab. How did that happen, and what are you working on now?"
77,29,Fei Ting,"I did my undergraduate degree in linguistics, which I loved. It was fantastic. I think for the first time when our professors were like, 'Let's do research on the languages that you speak,' it was the first time that I thought, 'Oh, you mean I can study Singapore English, like Singlish, in an academic setting? You mean it's worthy of being studied?' I think that was the first thing. Then later on, after graduation, because I had looked at what speech therapy is and isn't in Singapore currently, I thought, 'Well, maybe I should go and do some work, earn some money, and then think about whether or not I wanna do grad school,' and then I think eventually settled on just my love for research more than being a therapist or going out and practicing in a clinical setting. I decided to pursue my master's, and then after that, I just stayed with the same lab."
77,30,Gretchen,"As a day-to-day level, as a lab manager, you're working with and supervising the various studies that are being run by the professors and students and people in the lab. Yeah, what do you do as a lab manager?"
77,31,Fei Ting,"The number one thing is coordinating the different studies that go on. We have studies that are carried out independently by our PhD students. We also have studies that we run as a group amongst all of our research assistants and our student assistants, and then just making sure that everything is running on schedule. I also do a lot of prep before any study's been conducted. We write all of our surveys. We make sure that all of the equipment is well set up. Then there is also the administrative side of things, which is the boring and less-glamorous part of research."
77,32,Gretchen,"This is working on writing grants or filling out paperwork to get permission to work with children. You have to go through the ethics board and tell them, 'No, we're not gonna harm the children. It's gonna be fine. They're just gonna look at some pictures and hear some sounds or something.' If you've got equipment -- like you've got an EEG machine, which is the electrode cap that you put on your head, and you can see the brain waves going. I guess that probably needs to be maintained."
77,33,Fei Ting,"We need to watch that very thoroughly. We need to train our students when they come into the lab on how to use it. We have interns come in every summer, and they do good work with us. I also manage all of our interns and, I think, help our students or our undergrads see what's the reality behind doing research. I think, very often, they might think about grad school, or they might think about moving into the field of academia after graduation, just seeing the glam side of things, or looking at papers that are being published, or books that are being written."
77,34,Gretchen,"And papers look very polished, right. Like, 'Oh, we did this thing. We had 32 infants. They came in and did this.' It doesn't tell you like, 'This infant started crying, and so we had to exclude them,' or like, 'These infants -- we tried to call their parents, and they wouldn't reply to our messages, and so they wouldn't come in. We actually tried to get 52, but only 32 came.'"
77,35,Fei Ting,"Yes, the day-to-day of it is very mundane. A lot of the work that we are focusing now on is understanding the linguistic landscape for children growing up in Singapore, so we wanna find out what's going on at home: Who is talking to them, and in what languages, and in what proportion? The best way to do that right now is to send them home with a little recorder."
77,36,Gretchen,"I've seen this recorder. It's sort of the size of a credit card but thicker. You put it in a shirt that the child wears, and it has a little Velcro pocket, so it doesn't fall it. Then it runs, and the kid can run around, and you're not trying to keep them in front of a mic where they have to stay still, which because they're toddlers, they're not gonna do that. You can hear anything that the infant says and also anything that someone says, like an adult or an older child, says around them."
77,37,Fei Ting,"That's right. That recorder goes on for about 10-16 hours on its own. When we get that recording back, the humans have to go listen to these recordings. We do a lot of transcription work. That is one of the day-to-day mundane things. It's not exciting. You sit in front of a computer, and you open up a file, and you're listening, maybe, for an hour before you have to stop because it's just too much. We do a lot of fine-grained transcription. We're not only noting down the words that are being said, we are also looking at who's saying it; we're counting the number of turns; we're making it for the different languages. Right now, I'm speaking English, but the day-to-day conversation for a Singaporean household might be English plus a lot of other things that are going on. Maybe it's different from what we conventionally understand as code-switching or the way that code-switching is being described in textbooks is that you switch very elegantly from one language to the other in a nice, wrapped up sentence."
77,38,Gretchen,"Right. So, it's saying like, okay, I'm gonna say this bit in, for me, English, and then French or something, and I'm going back and forth. This implies that these two languages are distinct entities that I'm switching back and forth between them. But if you've grown up in a multilingual household your whole life, and your parents have also grown up in a multilingual household, what you're also doing is producing the whole spectrum in a way that's like how people have produced it around you but also may be a little bit different."
77,39,Fei Ting,"It's not 'clean' code switching. It happens within an utterance. People swap out words, and sometimes it's conscious, sometimes it's unconscious, sometimes it's deliberate to make a point. The way that we describe it, or I like to think about it, is if you have a salad bowl of different components -- you have your tomatoes; you have your cucumber and onions -- as I'm speaking to a different person, I can decide which part of the salad I wanna pick, which ingredient I wanna pick. It's not a clean switch. For me, it would be English and Mandarin. It's not a clean switch between the two. Then, of course, there's this very exciting thing called 'Singlish.'"
77,40,Gretchen,"This is stuff that's unique to Singapore. 'Singlish' seems to imply that it's English-y, but there's stuff from lots of languages involved."
77,41,Fei Ting,"When I was in university, and when we first looked at it from a very academic setting, it's often described as a 'creoloid.' It's a little bit like a creole but maybe not. Then people have explained to it say that, oh, the backbone of Singlish is English, and then it's added with all these vocabulary from non-English languages."
77,42,Gretchen,This is gonna be like Chinese but less Mandarin.
77,43,Fei Ting,"Less Mandarin, for sure. More Hokkien. In some other parts of the world, 'Hokkien' is also referred to as 'Min Nan.' Then some Cantonese, some Teochew, Hakka, and then some Malay, and some Tamil."
77,44,Gretchen,"So, Hokkien, Cantonese, Teochew, and Hakka are all Chinese varieties within that, and then Malay and Tamil are separate from other regions of the world. These are all groups that have been part of Singapore."
77,45,Fei Ting,"We were colonised by the British for a long time. Before that time, we didn't really have people living on the island. Well, historically, if you look at it, there were fishermen or fishing villages, but largely this island is uninhabited. Then when the British came, and they decide to develop this place, or this island, as a port, obviously, lots of people came for work opportunities. We saw a lot of migration from modern-day south part of China, so the Guangzhou/Guangdong region. We also saw some migration from modern-day Malaysia and Indonesia and then from the southern part of India. That's why the Indian language that's spoken here, predominantly, by people at that time was Tamil instead of Hindi, for example."
77,46,Gretchen,"These are the big ethnic groups in Singapore's history. And then when people are coming into contact with them, they get mixed together -- people using words from all sorts of sources. This is what kids are exposed to in the home. It's not just 'Oh, here's Chinese. Here's Mandarin,' which is the most famous version of Chinese, 'but also here are words from Hokkien or Teochew or these other varieties,' and also, I guess, probably depending on the kid's heritage, whether they're gonna have more Malay words or more Tamil words or more Chinese words."
77,47,Fei Ting,That's right.
77,48,Gretchen,"What does this look like when you're trying to say, 'Here are the results that we have. This is what kids are getting exposed to'?"
77,49,Fei Ting,"I think the thing that we didn't expect was to do so much language documentation as part of this project. Because what we wanna do is find out, you know, what are kids growing up hearing. But then, along the way, because we were collecting all of this data, we are also documenting what is the current state of things for what Singlish sounds like or what we can say what Singlish is in a household right now. If we look at the Singapore census, the last one was taken in 2020, a huge number of the younger population now say that English is the predominant home language. It has crossed the 50% threshold for the younger age groups. That's a first in our country's history. You can also imagine that the English here or the Singlish here is changing rapidly compared to my parents' or my grandparents' era."
77,50,Gretchen,"What people are doing is changing. If you say English is a dominant home language, that's picking one out of probably there are still several languages being spoken in this mixed way."
77,51,Fei Ting,"Understanding what Singlish is is one thing, and then when we are writing it in our paper, how do we make ourselves well understood for an audience that is unfamiliar with research in a non-standard variety. One of the things that we tried explaining is this term that we use called 'red-dot.' We have a current study going on called 'Red-dot Baby-talk' where we have a list of words that we come up with based on what we know Singaporean parents use with their children, and we're asking Singaporeans, 'At what age do you think a child would know this word?' and 'Would you use this word with a child?'"
77,52,Gretchen,"Just to back up for second. 'Red-dot' is a term for Singapore, right, because if you look at a big map of the world, it's a city state, effectively, it's about the size of a red dot on a map. So, this is an affectionate way of referring to Singapore-specific words."
77,53,Fei Ting,"Mm-hmm, yeah. One of the words would be 'pom pom.' I might say it to a child after they've had a long day, and they're sweaty, and I say, 'Okay, now it's time to pom-pom.'"
77,54,Gretchen,Is this like 'have a bath' or 'a shower' or something?
77,55,Fei Ting,"Yeah! That's right. We don't know -- at least I have no idea -- where that word came from. My guess is it's from one of these Chinese varieties that we talked about just now, but I'm not 100% certain."
77,56,Gretchen,Right. Because it doesn't have a clear etymology linked to any particular language. It's just this is a word people use in Singapore with kids.
77,57,Fei Ting,"Then we have 'zut-zut,' which is the thing that you give to a crying child."
77,58,Gretchen,"Like a candy or something, or a toy?"
77,59,Fei Ting,Like a pacifier.
77,60,Gretchen,"'Pacifier,' 'binky,' 'dummy' -- I've heard a lot of words for it -- 'soother.'"
77,61,Fei Ting,"Then we also have the word 'sayang.' 'sayang' is -- well, originated from Malay, but the use of it in Malay, it's very different from the use of it in Singlish. In Malay, it can be used as a verb to mean, like, 'love.' It can also be used as a term of affection. You can call someone your 'sayang,' your 'darling.' But in Singlish, it's this action of stroking very gently. If you see a little cat, you might tell your child to 'sayang' the cat."
77,62,Gretchen,'Make sure you do it gently and don't pull the cat's fur and their tail and make them scratch you.'
77,63,Fei Ting,"If someone in that context is using the word 'sayang,' I wouldn't necessarily say that that person is code switching into Malay."
77,64,Gretchen,"Right, because it has a different meaning in Malay, and they're not using it with that meaning."
77,65,Fei Ting,"And I'm not a Malay speaker, so when I use the word 'sayang,' I can't say that I'm code switching into Malay. I've just chosen a token in Singlish."
77,66,Gretchen,"I can see how they're used in a child-specific context, but there're other parts of Singlish that are just part of the everyday vocabulary for adults and stuff as well."
77,67,Fei Ting,"Yes, yes, yes, that's right. So, you've been here a few days now, and food is a big thing in Singapore, and when food is good or when things are going well, in a good scenario, we can say, 'shiok.'"
77,68,Gretchen,"I've seen this on some signs. It seems to be -- I was walking in one of the streets, and they were saying, 'shiok' because they were trying to say, 'This food is good,' and it's good in a Singaporean sort of way. I think the sign said, 'Shiok lah,' which was maybe a little bit trying to be really heavy on the Singlish thing because 'lah' is this famous word in Singlish that is used as a particle at the end of sentences for a lot of different purposes."
77,69,Fei Ting,"For a lot of different purposes. We have a lot of these sentence-final, utterance-final particles. Origin of it is from Chinese varieties. We have 'lah,' 'leh,' 'meh,' 'hor,' 'liao' -- maybe lots of other ones that I'm missing right now."
77,70,Gretchen,"There's probably a whole list. I mean, we can link to some things about Singlish if people want to get a larger picture of what's going on. This is not the teach-us-Singlish-in-half-an-hour episode. But yeah, the one that I've heard people say a fair bit is 'lah' because it seems to be pretty common. It's like a confirmation or question."
77,71,Fei Ting,"Confirmation. It's also sometimes used to make something sound final and definitive. Like if you ask me if I could do something, and I say, 'Can lah.'"
77,72,Gretchen,"This gets us to another one that I've also heard people use which is 'Can' by itself as sort of a response to questions or whether something can happen. I was in a cab, and the cab driver said, 'Can?', as in, 'Can you get out okay?', or 'Are you doing this?', and I guess I probably should've responded, 'Can,' but I don't have this naturally yet. Maybe if I'm here a little bit longer."
77,73,Fei Ting,"You can say, 'Can,' or 'Can can.' 'Can can' is to confirm that you can actually do something, or it can happen."
77,74,Gretchen,"I think the closest thing that I have to that in my English is 'Can do,' which still drops the subject or doesn't have the subject there, but for some reason I want the 'do' to be there -- 'Can do.' Or like, 'I can,' 'I think I can,' compared to, I heard someone say, 'Think can,' where I would say, 'I think I can.'"
77,75,Fei Ting,Over here 'Think can' or 'I think can' is very well-formed. 'I think I can' is --
77,76,Gretchen,Almost too much?
77,77,Fei Ting,"Yeah, almost too much."
77,78,Gretchen,"Or you're being very emphatic about that it's 'I' think I can -- may 'you' don't. This is probably Chinese influence, right?"
77,79,Fei Ting,"Yeah. If we think about Chinese as a language that determines the topic of the sentence first, and then you add comments to that topic, that's why we can go about dropping the subject or dropping a lot of these modal verbs. One of the studies that we did previously was, well, one of our undergrads started this project. We ask people to look at different menus and order the same dish but to imagine themselves in three different settings. The first setting is the menu is printed on really nice, fancy paper, and fancy font, and it's supposed to mimic a fancy restaurant. The second menu is in casual font, and the setting is a hip café. Then the last one, we didn't have a menu, but it was just a picture of a hawker centre stall front."
77,80,Gretchen,"The hawker centres have a whole bunch of little marketplaces but indoors. They have all these food stalls. You go around from each one and you sit -- I think of them as cafeteria tables. You sit out at them. You have a tray, and you get food and drinks and desserts and stuff from different places. This is very informal."
77,81,Fei Ting,"Yeah, very, very informal. We had undergrads come in and order the same dish which is the dish of laksa."
77,82,Gretchen,Which I've now had. It was very good. It's kind of a spicy soup.
77,83,Fei Ting,"Yeah. And then the instruction was that, when they ordered it, they have to ask for more chili, and they should ask to take it away."
77,84,Gretchen,Just to give them more things to say.
77,85,Fei Ting,"Yeah. So, when people are imagining themselves in a very fancy restaurant, they might say, 'Can I please have a bowl of laksa? Can you add more chili? And I would like to have it taken away.'"
77,86,Gretchen,These very full sentences and trying to be polite and add this extra ornamentation around that.
77,87,Fei Ting,"Mm-hmm. Then when you do a syntax analysis on it, I mean, we draw grammar trees, you end up with a very complex grammar tree or quite a number of grammar trees just to explain this one scenario. But when they're given a picture of a hawker stall, and they're supposed to imagine a very informal setting, they can say something like, 'Aunty, one laksa, more chili, takeaway.'"
77,88,Gretchen,"'Aunty, one laksa, more chili, takeaway,' just saying each of the bits of information without, 'Oh, please, if you don't mind, can I have this.'"
77,89,Fei Ting,"You don't need the 'Can I have...' You don't need the extra verbs or the extra sentence structure. It's just the topic -- 'one laksa,' and then 'more chili,' and then 'takeaway.'"
77,90,Gretchen,"And this is not rude. This is polite. This is a normal thing you say. And you've said 'Aunty' because you're addressing the stall owner as 'Aunty' or 'Uncle,' based on who they are, which is polite."
77,91,Fei Ting,"That's also another thing about -- I think you hear it here in Singapore. You also would hear it in Malaysia. This calling everyone 'Aunty' and 'Uncle' even though they're not related to you if they are somewhere like the age your parents might be, and then you just -- 'Aunty,' 'Uncle' -- everyone is."
77,92,Gretchen,You have other words for people who are closer in age to you or younger?
77,93,Fei Ting,Not quite.
77,94,Gretchen,It's more about elders.
77,95,Fei Ting,"It's more for elders. If I approach, like -- or if I'm in a cab -- the 'Taxi Uncle' might address me as 'Xiao Mei,' like 'Little Girl' or 'Young Girl.' Or if I'm ordering something, and they wanna be nice and polite, they might say, 'Mei Nü,' which is 'Pretty Girl.' Even though --"
77,96,Gretchen,They're not hitting on you. This is just a polite thing to say.
77,97,Fei Ting,"Yeah. But usually you will hear them say 'Xiao Mei,' which is 'Little Girl,' to a female and then 'Xiao Di' to a guy ordering something."
77,98,Gretchen,"Because you have that age thing. In French, I'm used to people addressing me as 'Madame' or 'Mademoiselle.' There was a period when I was getting 50/50, and now it's mostly 'Madame,' so clearly people think I've gotten older. But there was a period when it depended on what on wore for which one I would get. How strangers address you in public is just --"
77,99,Fei Ting,"If my mom were to go to the market, for example, she might address someone working there as 'Aunty,' and then they will also address her as 'Aunty.'"
77,100,Gretchen,"We're both at the right age where we could have nieces and nephews, so we're both 'Aunties' now."
77,101,Fei Ting,And that's perfectly fine.
77,102,Gretchen,"You've also been doing some interesting things with research methodology and how to get this audio data, apart from bringing parents into the lab and having them talk to kids."
77,103,Fei Ting,"Well, with COVID, everything was interrupted. I think people who are doing research -- everyone would commiserate over our lack of ability to reach out to parents with little kids. We did a years-long study on Zoom."
77,104,Gretchen,"So, you get parents talking to their kids on Zoom. Kids aren't always very good at interacting with a computer, with the technology."
77,105,Fei Ting,"We had 8- to 36-month-olds. The task was for their parents to describe to them a wordless picture book on Zoom. Sometimes, like you said, some kids are clearly not interested."
77,106,Gretchen,"But at least having a picture book to look at gives them something to do on camera and not just like, 'C'mon, talk! Talk to the nice research aunty.'"
77,107,Fei Ting,"Exactly. Because the picture book is wordless, it's up to them in what language they would like to do the task in. Some parents get very excited about describing every single thing on the screen instead of just following along the main storyline. Sometimes, they will break off to 'Oh, you remember, we saw an elephant' -- because in the book, there is an elephant -- and then they might, 'the other day' or 'the other time, we went to the zoo. We saw an elephant. You remember.' And then they might go on talking about other things, which is a nice thing about wordless picture books, actually."
77,108,Gretchen,"It just gives them some stimulus to talk about, rather than just being like, 'Okay, here we are in front of a computer. All we can talk about is the computer.' Now, you've got the elephant as a topic of conversation."
77,109,Fei Ting,"And I don't know about kids growing up in this COVID period. Maybe they've gotten used to seeing another human onscreen. We didn't have kids who were like, 'Ah, this is so weird. I don't wanna do this anymore.'"
77,110,Gretchen,"Because they're already talking to, probably, other friends and family members and things using Zoom because they're pandemic babies."
77,111,Fei Ting,"Exactly. We had some funny things that happened. This brings back to the reality of doing research. Sometimes, I would have parents carry the laptop they were talking to me on, on Zoom, and chasing after their kid, or like, 'Ah, just come back here. This nice lady is waiting for us to finish the story,' and things like that happened. Or because we're recording them in their home, sometimes someone walks into the room that they're in. These sort of unexpected scenarios do pop up from time to time, but we're really happy with the data that we managed to collect."
77,112,Gretchen,Do you have results for that yet?
77,113,Fei Ting,"We have a methods paper out because, as part of the study, we ran it as a micro-longitudinal intervention study."
77,114,Gretchen,What does that mean?
77,115,Fei Ting,"The intervention that we ran was for the parents. We wanted to see if giving parents tips -- concrete tips -- on what they can do with their child to improve or to add on to the kind of talk they can have with their child, whether or not that would influence or change the way that they would communicate with their kids. The baseline was describing the wordless picture book the first time, and then they would go through an intervention for --"
77,116,Gretchen,"So, they would get text messages every day for 28 days that would say things like, 'Have you considered singing songs with your kid?', or 'When you see pictures, talking about what's in the pictures,' or something like that?"
77,117,Fei Ting,"Every day we gave them a tip. The tips start out really easy like doing some counting, and then the last we tell parents about concepts that might be a bit more advanced, things like mental state verbs -- so verbs like 'I think' or 'I wonder.' There is literature to show that when you use mental state verbs with your child, 1). you're helping them imagine scenarios they are not in, right, think about it from someone else's perspective. So, this ties in with this thing called the 'theory of mind.' Then when you use these words, especially in English, your sentences get a bit more complex."
77,118,Gretchen,"Because if you're saying, 'I think this,' and then you have to have another sentence in there, which is not quite the same thing if you're doing like, 'Think can.'"
77,119,Fei Ting,"Exactly. After 28 days, we see them again on Zoom for the same video call picture book description. Then we ran it as an RTT -- randomised control trial."
77,120,Gretchen,"So, they're randomly in one group that has these 28 tips in between, and then another group that has something less."
77,121,Fei Ting,"The other group, we only gave them one email a week. There're no concrete tips. It's just emphasising on how important it is to talk to their child. But because the way we advertise it, we said, 'You can sign up. We'll give you some tips.'"
77,122,Gretchen,"Ah, so this was important to make parents wanna participate in the study because they think they're doing something good for their child by getting some tips there. Because there's lots of reasons people wanna participate in studies. Sometimes, you pay them. Sometimes, the kid gets a toy or something. But also, in this case they wanted to feel like they were getting some help with raising a kid."
77,123,Fei Ting,"Yeah. After the first 28 days and then after we saw them for a second time point, we swapped both groups of parents around. If you had intervention, now you're in the non-intervention group, and you only got one email per week. Then the parents who didn't get the tips previously, they now got a message every day."
77,124,Gretchen,"So, are you sitting there texting all the parents individually? Or do you have an automatic system?"
77,125,Fei Ting,"No, we don't. Our research assistant, Shaza, she was doing all the texting. Because it was a rolling sign up programme --"
77,126,Gretchen,"You have some people who are on Day 2, and some people who're on Day 20, and they each need to get a different message. It's almost complicated to program."
77,127,Fei Ting,"It's difficult. She would text them at 10:00 in the morning and say, 'Today's tip is this.' And then with each tip, we would also give a link to our website where they can read more if they wanted to. In the evening, around 4:00 to 5:00 p.m., she would text them again and say, 'Hi Parent, did you try our tip today? How did you find it?' That's the other unique part of our intervention because a lot of the times when people are in an intervention, they're left alone for the entirety, and then at the end they might be given a feedback survey."
77,128,Gretchen,It's almost just as much about having the support for talking about what parenting was like and reflecting on using language with their child that they feel like they got some sort of emotional support out of it.
77,129,Fei Ting,"Yeah. Or any kind of interaction. Because at that time, well, we started collecting data June of 2020."
77,130,Gretchen,This is lockdown.
77,131,Fei Ting,"Lockdown, right. A lot of parents were working from home. People couldn't see their family members. So, having a researcher to talk to might be nice."
77,132,Gretchen,"[Laughs] Yeah, that's kind of nice."
77,133,Fei Ting,"Or a lot of children, if they were going to infant care or day care, all of that had stopped."
77,134,Gretchen,Of course.
77,135,Fei Ting,"I guess for a lot of parents, it was like, 'Oh, I'm given some kind of support!'"
77,136,Gretchen,"It would be interesting, I guess, to try to figure out how much of that was pandemic or lockdown specific, especially if the parent is becoming the child's only or primary source of language input in a way that, if they're going to child care or preschool or seeing their relatives and stuff like that, they wouldn't be as much dependent on one or two people for talking with the child all the time as language input, they would have a broader community access."
77,137,Fei Ting,"That's right. I think that was one of the things that parents have told us, like, 'Oh, yeah, language input has changed.' It's not something that they actively thought about, but then they're like, 'Oh, yeah, my kid's not getting that much Malay because, well, my mom speaks to them in Malay, but now we can't visit grandma anymore.'"
77,138,Gretchen,This changes the way that the language input goes.
77,139,Fei Ting,We have a methods paper out. We are still transcribing.
77,140,Gretchen,Transcribing takes so long.
77,141,Fei Ting,It does.
77,142,Gretchen,"I think the estimate that I learned in grad school was, like, for every one minute of audio, it takes an hour to transcribe."
77,143,Fei Ting,"That's the pace that we're going at. We have been very blessed with lots of great transcribers and student assistants who've come in and helped us, so we are almost there. We're very happy that we have 142 parents and families that stayed with us through all three time points. I think it's a little rare to see that for a longitudinal study involving children."
77,144,Gretchen,"They had nothing else to do in lockdown, so they stayed in your study."
77,145,Fei Ting,"Yeah, I like to think that. And I also like to think that we were nice, and they found it useful."
77,146,Gretchen,To have the supportive text messages every day.
77,147,Fei Ting,We're going into the next stage where we will be doing some analysis. We're counting number of turns taken. We're counting number of words and the diversity of words being used and whether or not people swapped or changed or code switched in any way.
77,148,Gretchen,"And then you end up with, also, this linguistic landscape of how people are talking in their homes, at least, when they have a kid around. And you can see which bits there. When you're talking about code switching, you can say, 'Okay, these words are in English. These words are specifically in Hokkien or Mandarin. These words are in Tamil or Malay,' but you also have the Singlish-specific words, the Red-dot words, that are hard to pin down for one particular language."
77,149,Fei Ting,"We've essentially written our own little dictionary, actually."
77,150,Gretchen,That's great!
77,151,Fei Ting,"Along the way, we were like, ah, there's this word that's come up, but because a lot of Singlish hasn't been codified or documented, there is no one way to spell it."
77,152,Gretchen,Of course. Because it's mostly spoken.
77,153,Fei Ting,"If we've decided to spell it one way, we always have to check with other Singlish speakers around us, and then -- we don't wanna say, 'Oh, we're spelling it this way, and this way must be right.' We're saying, 'We have to come up with something.'"
77,154,Gretchen,"You have to pick one because if you wanna say, 'Okay, for every hundred words that this parent says, 30 of them are in Malay, 50 of them are in English, 23 of them are in Singlish/Red-dot words.' It's hard to pin down exactly which of them are from where, but you need to be able to look through and say, 'This one word, 'shiok,' is being used this many times in the whole corpus,' not 'We spelled it 14 different ways, and so we have no idea how many times it's being used,' just for your own internal purposes, which isn't to say that someone else is wrong for using a different spelling."
77,155,Fei Ting,"That's right. We wanna be very open about it, so we have a Wiki page that's open for anyone who wants to come and look at our transcription conventions. Our dictionary is also open access, so people can come in and take a look at that, at how we've decided to codify certain things just because we need it for our own, like you mentioned, counts and things like that. The other part of our project is working with speech engineers. I'm sure you're familiar with Siri and Google, right."
77,156,Gretchen,"I talk into the -- they transcribe me, they understand me. But I notice even when I'm speaking French to them, which I don't have a native French accent, they're not very good at transcribing what I'm saying in a language that isn't like the very Paris French that they're trained on. I bet this happens with Singlish."
77,157,Fei Ting,"It's a challenge. It's difficult in Singlish. It's difficult when people switch between or among the languages so rapidly. We had a PhD student from the engineering department that was on this project, and he was looking at how do you do automatic language identification on the recordings that we collected because --"
77,158,Gretchen,This could save you a lot of time if it works.
77,159,Fei Ting,"If it works. But it's also a really challenging problem. One, it's that it's not the standard variety and then the other thing is it's child directed. They don't have good solutions for child-directed speech yet."
77,160,Gretchen,"Because people talk differently to children. They maybe use, depending on the language, like a broader range of pitches, or higher pitches, maybe they talk a bit slower, they have child-specific vocabulary, like this word for 'pacifier' which has a lot of child-specific words in different languages or different varieties. This is not the kind of thing that language models are trained on. They're training on journalists talking on the news in this very formal context."
77,161,Fei Ting,"That's right. Our PhD student has done really great work. We also work with our speech engineers at Johns Hopkins University. Whenever we have meetings with them, I tell them, 'Oh, I'm so sorry for our' -- our data set's really problematic. I know that. I understand that. But they see it as a great challenge."
77,162,Gretchen,"Right. And if all you're doing is news stuff, it's less interesting or relevant. Maybe it's a problem, but maybe the algorithms that were not accounting for it are the problem."
77,163,Fei Ting,Exactly. Our language models are only as good as the data that we train them on. They all come with a certain set of biases.
77,164,Gretchen,Absolutely.
77,165,Fei Ting,"Right now, the bias is non-child-directed language."
77,166,Gretchen,And non-Singaporean language.
77,167,Fei Ting,"Non-Singaporean language. It's been interesting just looking at our data from their point of view as well. There's gonna be more and more reliance on AI in the future, for sure, not just for our line of work but just part of our day-to-day living. If AI is supposed to accommodate the natural languages of the world, then it should be able to do this."
77,168,Gretchen,"And it should actually be trained on how people talk in multilingual environments. Fei Ting, thanks so much for coming on the podcast."
77,169,Fei Ting,Thanks for having me.
77,170,Gretchen,"If you could leave people knowing one thing about linguistics, what would it be?"
77,171,Fei Ting,"I think it would be that there's still a lot that we don't know. I think the brain is a fascinating organ, and a lot of what we do know about what the brain does when it comes to language processing and language acquisition, we know it from a very monolingual English point of view. Most of the people around the world are non-monolingual speakers, and a lot of them don't speak English, so if we wanna know how this organ that we have works when it comes to language acquisition and language processing, then we need more research on non-monolingual English-speaking populations.

78,1,Gretchen,"Hello, Gab, welcome!"
78,2,Gabrielle,"Hi! Hi, everyone."
78,3,Gretchen,Thanks so much for joining us.
78,4,Gabrielle,"Ah, thanks for having me. I would like to, before we start, just acknowledge the Country and where we are at the moment is at La Trobe University Bundoora campus. It's beautiful Wurundjeri country. I want to pay my respects to Elders past and present."
78,5,Gretchen,Thanks for sharing that. My first question is 'How did you get into linguistics?'
78,6,Gabrielle,"Wow! A big question. I think that I began my journey into linguistics when I was at school. Originally, I was very enthusiastic about plants. Things like biology, the life system, how things grow, and how we're all connected. I thought I might become a nurse. So, I registered in a course, and then I pulled out because there wasn't any role models. Deaf nurses were not there. I felt that I couldn't do that and dropped it. In a few years, I went to work, realised as a deaf person seeing a world very differently, it was very different from being in school, being in the big wide world, and communication was very difficult. There were many barriers. I started to get interested in language, communication, speech, and sign. I started to think, 'Okay, I want to go into a university course and look at linguistics.' Auslan being my language, I wanted to bring those two together. I enrolled here at La Trobe University way back."
78,7,Gretchen,Did you start enrolling in linguistics courses right away or do some other things as well?
78,8,Gabrielle,"No, I went straight to linguistics -- the whole gamut -- seriously."
78,9,Gretchen,What parts of linguistics were you excited about?
78,10,Gabrielle,"Originally, I was interested in speech and phonetics. And like I said before, it was really speech, for me, that was quite puzzling. It was throughout my life. When I went into this course and started studying linguistics, I had the opportunity to pull it apart -- what speech was like. I looked at phonetics. I had an amazing teacher here, Professor Marija Tabain. She was a big supporter. She brought in another skilled person to teach me one-on-one about speech. And then, at the same time I was learning Auslan and sign language linguistics from two amazing Deaf teachers, Berna Hutchins and also Anne Bremner. Those were the two teachers who were working here at La Trobe back then. I was very lucky to have had that speech and linguistic training and also sign language training."
78,11,Gretchen,You started doing research at some point in this?
78,12,Gabrielle,"Yes, I did. I did my Honours here. I did a small research project, and that was about Auslan. My supervisor -- his name is Professor David Bradley -- who used to work here at La Trobe as well. He was a marvellous support, too. He would say, 'Go! Go overseas! Go to London! There's a summer school there that's specifically on sign linguistics,' so off I went with my small Auslan research project and presented. I met so many marvellous d/Deaf scholars there. People like Lina Hou --"
78,13,Gretchen,"We've done an interview with Lina Hou, actually."
78,14,Gabrielle,"Yes, yes! And also, I met with Julie Hochgesang. Oh, many other wonderful, wonderful people."
78,15,Gretchen,What happened because of this?
78,16,Gabrielle,"Well, from that summer school in London where I knew that this was the right thing to be doing -- I wanted to continue researching sign language, I wanted to look at linguistics and look at other d/Deaf people, to get that support for sign language, and also to support the Deaf community. I came back to Australia, and I signed up for a PhD programme. That was under Professor Trevor Johnston. At that time, he was at Macquarie University. He set up the Auslan Corpus."
78,17,Gretchen,"So, you were making a corpus, like a big body of videos, I guess, of people signing in Auslan?"
78,18,Gabrielle,"That's right. I didn't do that. He actually created the corpus, did the filming of over 200 people producing signs. This meant there was already a rich set of resources available for those who were skilled enough to do research into Auslan and be able to select different elements and recognise certain things and understand how d/Deaf people actually used sign. It wasn't like sign linguists in the past. A lot of people had thought certain things, but it wasn't the actual researcher saying a sign was used naturally. Trevor Johnston's Auslan Corpus, for the first time, we were able to then analyse signing as it was produced more naturally."
78,19,Gretchen,"Where was he getting this data? Like, bringing people into a lab?"
78,20,Gabrielle,The Auslan Corpus was the first sign language corpus. It was created following traditional language recording and documentation methods and done in a lab. There was filming. There were several cameras sitting in that lab filming people chatting.
78,21,Gretchen,Sort of like what we're doing right now?
78,22,Gabrielle,"Yeah, pretty similar, yes."
78,23,Gretchen,But eventually you wanna know what people are talking about when they're not in a university campus in two chairs. Did they take it somewhere more natural?
78,24,Gabrielle,"For the Auslan Corpus, no. What they did was only in the lab. That influenced other people in the projects that they then began filming in more natural environments."
78,25,Gretchen,You were using this corpus for your PhD studies -- analysing what was being depicted in it?
78,26,Gabrielle,"Yes, yes. That corpus had a number of different elements, and different people signing. There were stories. There were conversations. There were also different games -- a whole number of things. At that time, when I was studying in 2010, conversations at that time -- you know, analysing people in conversation, that hadn't really been looked into for signed languages. It was more signed narratives that people looked at because, at the time, we were still trying to address barriers with applying linguistics theories to signed languages. We had problems with how we would research a 3-dimensional language, face-to-face language. How could we capture the signs? When you actually identify the signs, you had to think about what type of signs they were. Were they conventional signs, like where people agree on particular signs and the meaning of those signs, which makes them conventional, or were they more unusual and improvised signs, depending heavily on context to be understood? That was one of the biggest problems that we had at that time. I would analyse a narrative and analyse the signs and the signer's body as one whole."
78,27,Gretchen,"Some parts of that are conventional signs, like here's a word for 'book' or something, and then some parts of that are more depicting what it's like when you're holding a particular book, which is a large book or a heavy book or a small book or something like that?"
78,28,Gabrielle,"Exactly. That's a perfect example, yes."
78,29,Gretchen,What did you find? What were you looking at?
78,30,Gabrielle,"Well, from those narratives that I was looking at, I found a various number of things. My view at the time was that I was researching clause structure. I did things like -- as an example, spoken language has word order. But with sign language it was different because it's 3-dimensional. What was interesting was that, at first, was it the subject that came first or the verb? I was looking at that. Because the research that was being done in sign, narratives have a lot of components. There's 'role shift' or 'enactment.' It can also be called 'constructed action.' Some people call it 'quotatives.' That's where you become a character, become another person or another being, an animal, whatever. You will say or show what that particular entity did with your body. I looked at how enactment and other less conventional things were incorporated into the clause structure."
78,31,Gretchen,"I've seen sometimes when people are doing enactment, like, let's say you have a story with two people, and you're saying, 'Okay, this person does this [gestures right]. This person does this [gestures left],' and showing what their different actions are like."
78,32,Gabrielle,"Yes, it's just like that. At the time, I was working very closely with a very good friend of mine -- and a colleague -- that was Lindsay Ferrara. She was studying at Gallaudet University. She came to Australia to do her PhD with Trevor too. She had marvellous knowledge from what they taught at Gallaudet University at the time and brought that here. We sat and chatted. We looked at the way signs were being produced and tried to work out the best way to describe what people were doing."
78,33,Gretchen,What did you find out?
78,34,Gabrielle,"Well, one study that we looked at together was sign narratives. It was very basic, very simple, this narrative. It was a retelling genre. We had 20 people who told one story, and another 20 people telling another story. Each 20 people had the same story. We compared how people would produce the story in sign, then looked at when, why, and how they incorporated enactment."
78,35,Gretchen,What were the two narratives that you compared?
78,36,Gabrielle,"Okay. We had one narrative which was The Frog Story. That was involving 20 people signing The Frog Story. Lindsay did that work. Then there was another story called The Boy Who Cried Wolf. Again, 20 people relayed that story. I focused on that. The Frog Story was based on an illustrated picture book, and the pictures created the story, whereas The Boy Who Cried Wolf followed a written English narrative. So, the person had to read the story, think about it, and then reproduce it to another person. It was very worthwhile comparing notes with Lindsay because the two of us were able to see, from those narratives, similarities and differences in how the stories were conveyed in Auslan."
78,37,Gretchen,"The Frog Story is a classic story that's used in various areas of linguistics because it's this wordless picture book, right, but I think I've seen you have this boy who's lost a frog and has to find it with a dog and stuff. And then The Boy Who Cried Wolf is more a folktale that people might've been familiar with before the study."
78,38,Gabrielle,"Yeah, it was more a moral -- there was a moral to that story. So, you know, don't lie, pretty much. Don't trust a wolf. Things like that."
78,39,Gretchen,Don't raise false alarms.
78,40,Gabrielle,"Yes, exactly."
78,41,Gretchen,Did you find that there were differences in how people told those two stories?
78,42,Gabrielle,"Yes. What we found was huge differences. The Frog Story -- that was more repetitive in terms of depicting signs. For example, it discussed a jar with a lid and various elements, so a tree, beehive -- people fingerspelled 'beehive' and then showed a depicting sign to represent the beehive. Then The Boy Who Cried Wolf -- in that narrative, that followed more English structure. There was a big influence with English. There were more words about what people had said and what people did in that retelling. So, with The Frog Story, there was no dialogue within it, whereas The Boy Who Cried Wolf had more dialogue. It was very interesting to be able to compare both retellings across these signers and look at how enactment would occur in both stories."
78,43,Gretchen,"Do you think that's related to the plot of these stories, or the fact that one was in pictures and one was in words when they initially encountered it?"
78,44,Gabrielle,"I think that's what we did find. We looked at it, and we thought, 'What will we do?' We wanted to compare how the event structure proceeded when the signers conveyed these stories. So, Western stories usually have a beginning, and then one or two events where people start to become a bit fascinated and interested because something's happening within the narrative. Then it becomes the climax of the event and the resolution at the end -- or the summary. Lindsay and I looked at both narratives and how the events occurred throughout the narrative. We looked at when enactment occurred. What we found were very similar things in relation to enactment. When the story became very active and exciting, people would use more enactment to demonstrate a lot more of that action, and it became much more alive and interesting. And then the boring parts were less active."
78,45,Gretchen,More of the telling rather than showing at that point.
78,46,Gabrielle,Yeah. Basic information and then the enactment would occur in the signing during the more exciting parts.
78,47,Gretchen,What happened after this? Your research in enactment there -- it's led into future projects?
78,48,Gabrielle,"Yes, yes. That project was really important for Lindsay and I because we already knew how enactment was very important for sign language. It was not just gesture. It was not a 'pretend' form of language if you like, an acting out. It was a very integral part -- and very important part -- for sign languages. We became more interested in looking at it, and we became more interested to research how enactment would combine with other strategic elements within sign, for example, how you would use more conventional signs with enactment; how you would use depicting signs with enactment."
78,49,Gretchen,"So, conventional signs versus depicting signs?"
78,50,Gabrielle,"So, conventional signs are those signs, as you mentioned before, things like 'book,' and then depicting signs -- it might be a book and how big the book is. You're showing how big or how small the book is. You would sign the conventional first and then the depicting sign. If you're using the depicting sign, you would often also see enactment occur at the same time. Not always -- but commonly you would."
78,51,Gretchen,"When you're telling a story or something, you're doing the conventional signs, and then you're -- as you're enacting it or coming up with how it fits into the story or the narrative -- you're doing more depicting to show that?"
78,52,Gabrielle,"Yes, possibly."
78,53,Gretchen,Did you go onto other types of things other than stories?
78,54,Gabrielle,"Yeah. Lindsay and I continued the work that we were doing. Yes, so we became more excited about referencing. This is how people explain who did what to do whom. It's a very important topic to look at, and it's easy to research that. Also, with other languages it's easy to research that. So, our obsession with only enactment went on hold for a little while. We became a little bit more global , and looked at referencing in narratives. We went back to those narratives, and every time referencing occurred, such as when somebody mentioned 'the boy' or 'the dog' or 'the wolf' or 'the village people,' we noted down what had happened -- if it was mentioned first or mentioned later. Then we looked at how a person would deliver that reference."
78,55,Gretchen,"If the boy is more central to the story, then maybe 'the boy' is being said a lot or being said first, or conversely maybe doesn't need to be said very much at all because we know the whole story's about the boy."
78,56,Gabrielle,"Yes. What we commonly found was the first time somebody was mentioned, like 'the boy,' you would use the conventional sign 'boy' and possibly point to where the boy is situated in the sign space, and then point to the boy. And then if you're talking about the boy again throughout the story, then you would just enact the boy. That does the work of who is doing what to whom."
78,57,Gretchen,You can depict what he's doing or embodying him?
78,58,Gabrielle,"Yes, exactly. You can do it quite easily and demonstrate it clearly and easily because you already know from context that that's who it is."
78,59,Gretchen,"Because if it was someone else, you'd have to introduce that person instead."
78,60,Gabrielle,"Yes, sort of. [Laughter] It just depends on the reference -- depends what it is. For example, there are some referents in the story that were specific animals. Well, they were animals that we don't have in Australia. There were some animals that did crop up like there were 'ground rats.' I think they're called 'moles' or something."
78,61,Gretchen,"Sure. 'Groundhogs,' 'moles.'"
78,62,Gabrielle,"Yeah, something like that. If you look at The Frog Story book, you can see what the animal is there, but with the wolf story, there were sheep. And we do have sheep in Australia. Whereas, yeah, everyone knows what a wolf is. It was different for the other story with the groundhogs or moles. We did look at that. And it wasn't just the specific referent but also what animal or object was known to d/Deaf people to be able to then reproduce that, so that people knew what you were talking about. Clearly, depicting signs were very important when the referent wasn't known or when you needed to add additional information. That helped to then develop the understanding of the viewer. That's a big reason why depiction is very important."
78,63,Gretchen,"You can just say, you know, 'some sort of small critter' even if you don't have a specific name for it or don't recognise it and don't expect the other person to recognise it."
78,64,Gabrielle,"Yeah, you can just show it."
78,65,Gretchen,"So, you worked on narratives. You worked on how reference works. And what else?"
78,66,Gabrielle,"Well, I also did a lot of community projects. One example is I worked with a really exciting project -- an English to Auslan translation project. In Australia, we have many online translations where there's a person signing a translation of information on the screen. Back in 2014, people were noticing that some translations were very good and some were not. Della Goswell, who's at Macquarie University, set up a project to look into what d/Deaf people thought good translations look like and also to discuss d/Deaf and hearing interpreters and their translation abilities, and who would be the translators. We collected information about what would make a good translation. With that project, I worked very closely with a wonderful Deaf interpreter and translator who's extremely knowledgeable. Her name is Stef Linder. We worked with a number of other people in a team and went to different places in Australia talking about Auslan translations with a wide range of people."
78,67,Gretchen,Are these live translations on a stage or video translations of official material?
78,68,Gabrielle,"Video translations of -- yeah. Usually, live is called 'interpretation,' if it's live. And if it's something that you prepare for and unpack and film, then that is what we would understand as a 'translation.' That's the theory, anyway."
78,69,Gretchen,In principle. What kinds of genres were these translations in?
78,70,Gabrielle,"Oh, there was a number. It was more about the Deaf community here who often view translations. It might be information that is health related. It could be Government services like Centrelink information. It could be news like the Deaf Society might distribute news and events -- information about that. It could be a number of different topics."
78,71,Gretchen,What did you find about the quality of translation?
78,72,Gabrielle,"With that translation project, what we looked into and found was that it was vital that any online translation in Auslan matches the intended audience -- the specific audience. The Deaf community have a variety of different signers, and some people are fluent in English, other people are not. It's really important that any translation can suit those that don't have access to English. They can then access the information in Auslan."
78,73,Gretchen,"That makes sense. You also went overseas, right?"
78,74,Gabrielle,"Yes, I did. I finished that project, and I had a wonderful opportunity to go overseas. I worked at a well-known research centre, DCAL. It's the 'Deafness, Cognition and Language Research Centre.' That's under UCL in London."
78,75,Gretchen,"Yeah, University College London. What did you look into there?"
78,76,Gabrielle,"Well, when I was there, I was working on a project with Professor Kearsy Cormier. She set up a project looking at BSL (British Sign Language), and using the BSL Corpus, similar to the Auslan Corpus that we have here in Australia. They created a BSL Corpus, and the project I worked on didn't look at narratives but rather at conversations -- so people having conversations naturally with each other."
78,77,Gretchen,That sounds fun! Now you have two people to analyse -- or more.
78,78,Gabrielle,"Well, there were two people, yes. We didn't have groups. It was still only two people."
78,79,Gretchen,Just keep it simple for the first stage.
78,80,Gabrielle,"Yeah, I think so. But there are many people internationally that are now looking at group conversations for a variety of signed languages. It's quite complex."
78,81,Gretchen,"It's so hard. I mean, I've done some annotation of audio data and annotating video data for, like, 'Okay, who's saying what and when and what linguistic factors are going on?' That's got to be a whole lot of work."
78,82,Gabrielle,Definitely.
78,83,Gretchen,What were you looking at in this corpus?
78,84,Gabrielle,"Well, what we were doing was three things. We were looking at BSL and how people make sentences or clauses and how the grammar works. Secondly, we looked at negation. We were interested in how people were negating clauses, such as how they would use the sign 'can't' and how that head moved and fitted with the production of that sign, such as with a headshake. Then thirdly, how people asked questions. Were there manual signs in terms of 'who,' 'what,' and 'why'? I mean, I'm signing the BSL sign for 'why' while I'm talking about it. So, yeah, and what expressions on their face were then produced to show the person was asking a question. So, how that all fitted together."
78,85,Gretchen,That sounds neat. We can link to some of the papers and stuff that are about these various projects if people wanna learn more.
78,86,Gabrielle,"Yes, well, it depends when this episode's going to air if those papers are published by that time, but you can check my website or the DCAL website for those publications that are to come."
78,87,Gretchen,"Awesome! Yeah, I'm sure it's a long process. Gab, thanks so much for joining us."
78,88,Gabrielle,"Aw, thank you for having me."
78,89,Gretchen,"If you could leave people knowing one thing about linguistics, what would that be?"
78,90,Gabrielle,"Okay. Well, linguistics is really important. But if we want to really understand a language and understand communication, linguistics is not enough. I strongly believe that we need to have a variety of different disciplines of research, for example, the work that I've done over my career on language and translation and the Deaf community. Linguistics doesn't cover everything. You need to take many points of view into consideration. I would encourage people to keep an open mind, and be creative, and look at different ways that linguistics can be applied.[Music]"

79,5,Lauren,Hey.
79,6,Gretchen,Hey.
79,7,Lauren,Hey?
79,8,Gretchen,Hey!
79,9,Lauren,Hey!
79,10,Gretchen,"So, here's one word, 'hey,' and it's got a bunch of different vibes depending on what pitch contour we're using with it."
79,11,Lauren,"We can use those pitch contours with a whole bunch of different words to give them a different spin. If we have a word like, 'ice cream.'"
79,12,Gretchen,'Ice cream.'
79,13,Lauren,"Oh, very serious. Uh, 'Ice cream?'"
79,14,Gretchen,That's a bit of a question. Ice cream...?
79,15,Lauren,Ice cream and what?
79,16,Gretchen,Ice cream and ice cream!
79,17,Lauren,Perfect choice. 'Ice cream!'
79,18,Gretchen,Very excited ice cream.
79,19,Lauren,We've said the word 'ice cream' with a whole bunch of different intonation that's given it different meaning. That's because we're making use of the way that we can change the melody of words that we're saying.
79,20,Gretchen,"When we talk about the different kinds of pitches that words can have that change the meanings they have, I think it's probably useful to clarify what we mean by 'changing the pitches of the words' in this particular context. It's more like playing a word on a different kind of melody, which might be a very simple melody -- it might just be one or two notes -- and that melody is relative to the highness and lowness, the pitch of the words that came before it. But it's not an absolute melody because that's just sort of the range my voice lives in most of the time."
79,21,Lauren,"And different voices live in different ranges just like if we visit the woodwind section of a bunch of instruments, we've got small instruments like a piccolo or a big instrument like an oboe or a bassoon. They can all play exactly the same tune; they just play them at a different pitch."
79,22,Gretchen,"If we're thinking about something that's making a pitch intonation -- say something like question intonation, which is one of the easiest ones to think about because it's got that nice question mark for us to grab onto -- different people saying something with question intonation is sort of like playing the same song -- you know, 'Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star' or something -- on different kinds of instruments. It's all making that same melody of going down a bit and then up at the end."
79,23,Lauren,"There's a lot of different meaning that we associate socially with different pitches -- so whether someone has a high voice or a low voice. We played around a lot with this in our episode on vocal folds and how we have different associations with different pitches for different genders. In our interview with Nicole Holliday, she talked about how African American English has different intonation to Standard American English and what that says about identity, but today we're gonna look at more of the ways that we can use pitch and melody to change sentences or words in the way that they have meaning."
79,24,Gretchen,"Right. Let's start with the version of different pitch melodies that is the most accessible to English speakers, and that's the one that operates on a whole phrase and changes that meaning in relatively predictable ways no matter what sort of phrase it applies to. We have our example from earlier, 'Ice cream? Ice cream. Ice cream! Ice cream. Ice cream.'"
79,25,Lauren,"And in all of those cases, no matter how you say it, it still refers to the creamy, frozen desert."
79,26,Gretchen,"Right. But when we add something like question intonation or if we add list intonation or exclamation mark intonation, those change the ways in which it's interpreted in this very predictable way. If we add question intonation to lots of other words, they all sound question-y. You can have: 'Ice cream? Cake? Pizza? Barbecue? Umbrella? Clarinet?'"
79,27,Lauren,"Oh, okay, that's not a 'What's for dinner?' list."
79,28,Gretchen,"'Om nom nom, clarinet.'"
79,29,Lauren,They all end up being questions.
79,30,Gretchen,"Right. And you can do this with longer phrases and sentences to -- especially, there's subtle differences in different kinds of questions."
79,31,Lauren,Okay.
79,32,Gretchen,"I'm gonna say one sentence with two different versions of question intonation, and I want you to tell me what you think the meaning difference is."
79,33,Lauren,Okay.
79,34,Gretchen,"Number One, 'Can you bring cake or ice cream?', and Number Two, 'Can you bring CAKE or ice cream?'"
79,35,Lauren,"Okay, so the first one, I feel like it's much more open to like, you just want some kind of desert situation. I might turn up with a trifle, and it's probably okay."
79,36,Gretchen,"'Can you bring cake or ice cream?' -- yeah, that's sort of like a yes-no question, 'Can you do this?'"
79,37,Lauren,Some kind of desert.
79,38,Gretchen,As a general category.
79,39,Lauren,"Whereas with the other one, I really feel like my options to bring are cake or ice cream, and I have to choose one or the other."
79,40,Gretchen,"Right, exactly. In that case, I'm asking a question about these two alternatives and getting you to pick one, and actually, if you were to bring both, maybe that'd be kind of weird because I'm actually gonna get someone else to bring the other one."
79,41,Lauren,"Yeah, probably gonna hedge my bets and bring an ice cream cake though."
79,42,Gretchen,Ice cream cake is always acceptable.
79,43,Lauren,"Exactly where you go up in the phrase can really change the effect that the intonation has on the sentence. Questions rise up towards the end, but that's very different to another type of rising up which is a phrase specifically known as a 'high-rising terminal' but which you may know as 'uptalk' where that also goes up towards the end, but the point in the sentence at which it goes up is a little bit different. So, you can tell the difference between a question and uptalk."
79,44,Gretchen,"I think this is particularly interesting because when it comes to writing people often use a question mark to indicate both types of intonation. So, if you're saying something like, 'Ice cream?' But I think most people can actually tell the difference. Can I say them both to you and see which one you think is which?"
79,45,Lauren,Yeah.
79,46,Gretchen,"Here's Number One, 'There's some ice cream?' and Number Two, 'There's some ice cream?'"
79,47,Lauren,"That first one goes up and stays up earlier and stronger, which sounds much more like uptalk than a question to me. We use that to indicate that someone wants to continue saying something."
79,48,Gretchen,"Then in the second one, that's more of a question which actually goes down first and then up towards the end. That's 'There's some ice cream?' and 'There's some ice cream?' where I'm deliberately going 'ice cream' -- just going straight up over going down versus up. There's this difference here, even though we're not very precise about writing these sorts of intonational contours in English. People tend to use a question mark for both, and it's obvious from context. But it's fascinating to me that we can actually hear the difference."
79,49,Lauren,"When it comes to analysing the difference, sometimes linguists will literally draw a little up and down pitch contour over the top of a sentence to show that the question one does have that downward before upward movement."
79,50,Gretchen,I love these. I feel like they're very old school.
79,51,Lauren,"It's quite old school. You know, they are somewhat subjective, but they do show you the difference between the two patterns."
79,52,Gretchen,"I love this style. I think it's really quite easy to read. You often see them in typewritten manuscripts because it's a little bit hard to do digitally, but it's sort of easy to just draw with a pen. I find it quite easy and intuitive to read. Unfortunately, it's a little bit harder to do things like technical comparison with because you're drawing this very analogue curve, and then you're looking at another sentence and being like, 'Okay, is that the exact same shape that this person drew? Or did this little dip -- was that just like their hand got jogged or did they mean something by it?'"
79,53,Lauren,"Other systems involve using notation, like you might use 'H' for the bit that's high and 'L' for the bit that's low. I've seen other notation systems that use arrows as well to indicate those upward and downward movements in the melody."
79,54,Gretchen,"Yeah, the H and L one I feel like is relatively intuitive, although when you start combining it, it can get quite complicated. I've also seen people use numbering systems where you number pitches from one to four. The problem with this for me is that some people prefer a version where 'one' is low and 'four' is high, and some systems do the exact opposite thing, so when I see pitch numbers, I never quite know what's going on."
79,55,Lauren,Always worth checking what their transcription system is before getting into things is a thing I've learnt when it comes to number systems.
79,56,Gretchen,"Absolutely. I think that pitch systems are something where they've been one of the hardest things for me to learn at a technical level because when it comes to something like, 'Okay, here's some sounds. We're gonna produce them. We're gonna transcribe them. We're gonna write down a bunch of symbols for them,' that's something that I was able to learn in a relatively concrete way. But pitch is this thing that's overlaid on top of the individual sounds and applies to the whole syllable or to the whole word or the whole sentence and has taken me quite a while to be able to train my ear to hear rather than just perceiving the sentence as like, 'This is a question,' or 'This is angry,' or 'This is curious,' or something like that."
79,57,Lauren,"I think it takes practice to step away because it is something that is often used for that kind of emotional and stylistic effect, so it can be harder to step back and think about what's actually being done with intonation versus other things that we use strategically to create emotion in the way that we speak."
79,58,Gretchen,"I feel like I'm better at it now than I used to be. I'm still not as good as somebody who does this full time, but it is something you can improve at with practice, for sure."
79,59,Lauren,"Absolutely. I think the more you realise just how much it is dependent on the specific language, it can help you think a little bit about what's happening with intonation. A thing like having rising intonation at the end of a question where it goes up is not something that happens in all languages."
79,60,Gretchen,"I mean, I was calling this 'question' intonation, but does every language ask questions by doing this low and then high thing?"
79,61,Lauren,"A lot of languages do, but that doesn't mean that it's all languages do it. Hawaiian is a language that has falling question intonation, as an example."
79,62,Gretchen,This is the Indigenous language of Hawai'i?
79,63,Lauren,Yeah. And what's really interesting is that the Hawaiian creole that has arisen because of the contact between Hawaiian and English has actually continued to use that falling question intonation instead of English rising question intonation.
79,64,Gretchen,"Oh, that's really neat. That's something that's gotten passed on in the creole as well."
79,65,Lauren,Yeah.
79,66,Gretchen,"Question intonation is easy to talk about, but there're also other things that pitch is doing. I think one of my favourites is using pitch to indicate things like attitude. A word like 'great' -- you could say something like, 'Great.'"
79,67,Lauren,Okay.
79,68,Gretchen,'Great!'
79,69,Lauren,"Oh, much better."
79,70,Gretchen,'Great...'
79,71,Lauren,"Oh, no need to be sarcastic."
79,72,Gretchen,"So, that's 'Great. Great! Great...' It's sort of starting medium and dropping to low -- 'Great.' Enthusiasm with the pitch starting very high and ending low -- 'Great!' Or sarcasm which starts and ends low -- 'Great...'"
79,73,Lauren,It just stays low.
79,74,Gretchen,I'm picturing a teenager very sulkily in the corner -- 'Great...'
79,75,Lauren,Same word. The intonation gives it very different meanings.
79,76,Gretchen,Absolutely.
79,77,Lauren,"And a lot of those meanings are conveyed by the English writing system in traditional writing systems, and it's part of what I love about how you analyse how people are playing with new internet grammar and using all kinds of different techniques with the writing system to try and capture some of that spoken vibe."
79,78,Gretchen,"This is something that I talked about a lot in Because Internet, but there's also a Tumblr post that I think very succinctly summarises it in which the first poster says, 'Part of the New Internet Grammar: using question marks not to denote questions, but upturns in voice, so that a tentative statement gets a question mark but a flatly delivered question doesn't.' And then someone comes along, and I think very tongue-in-cheek says, all lowercase, no punctuation --"
79,79,Lauren,'why would you do this'.
79,80,Gretchen,"The first person again, 'It just seems right?' -- question mark. I think we're evolving more subtle ways of indicating intonation like this, including things like deadpan questions or tentative statements, but it's something that's kind of a work-in-progress in English, which is a nifty thing to keep observing."
79,81,Lauren,"You can also use intonation for emphasis. So, where you chose to create a rise in the sentence can indicate that something is prominent."
79,82,Gretchen,"Yeah. If you're looking in the freezer or something, and you're making a list of what's in there, you might end up with 'ice CREAM' and 'ice CUBES' even though normally you would say them as 'ice cream' and 'ice cubes' because they've both got 'ice' in it, you wanna stress the other part -- the 'cream' and the 'cubes' -- to differentiate between them a little bit more. But intonation isn't the only way that languages can emphasise different parts of a sentence. I feel like I had to learn how to do this a bit differently when I was getting more comfortable speaking French because, in English, we have this strong tendency to use this pitch part and also loudness and things like that to emphasise certain words. If you're in an ice cream place, and it's kind of loud, you might emphasise like, 'Can I get TWO SCOOPS of the CHOCOLATE ice cream in a CONE, please?' to make each of those parts more distinct. But I feel like French is a bit more likely to use word order in terms of which part you say first rather than saying particular parts in a more emphatic way. That hasn't been as effective for me when I'm speaking French."
79,83,Lauren,"Interesting. And it's a good reminder that when you're learning a language, you often don't overtly get taught how to use intonation. It's something that you pick up from listening experiments and talking to people and listening to people and trying to imitate them."
79,84,Gretchen,"Absolutely. Sometimes, it's easy to imitate in the sense that when people are doing mock versions of an accent, the intonation contours, the characteristic intonation contours, are some of the things that come really early. But I feel like it's also worth noting that sometimes what's a characteristic intonation contour -- just sort of a default one in one language -- might be something that carries an emotional meaning in another language. I guess you wanna be cautious when you're reading someone's intonation as hostile or as overly friendly that this might be a relatively baseline thing for them, and it's not that people are secretly hating you."
79,85,Lauren,"If someone's language doesn't have a rise at the end of a question, it might come across as a hostile question, but it's actually just the way they're used to asking questions."
79,86,Gretchen,"Yeah, it's something that's worth keeping in mind."
79,87,Lauren,"So far, we've looked at how we can use pitch to change the meanings of full phrases or sentences, but we can also use changes in pitch to change the meanings of specific words."
79,88,Gretchen,Right. This is less of 'ice-cream-question-mark' versus 'ice-cream-yay' or 'ice-cream-sarcastic' and more like 'ice cream' versus 'doorknob' or something completely different.
79,89,Lauren,"Or famously in Mandarin, the difference in tone creates a difference between the word 'mother' and 'horse' but also the words 'hemp' and 'scold,' which are all part of the four-tone system in Mandarin."
79,90,Gretchen,They're all based on 'ma' pronounced with different tones. You have the word for 'mother' which is 'mā.'
79,91,Lauren,That's high level.
79,92,Gretchen,'Mā.' The word for 'hemp' which is 'má.'
79,93,Lauren,That's a rising tone.
79,94,Gretchen,'Má.' The word for 'horse' which is 'mǎ.'
79,95,Lauren,That's falling with a bit of a rise at the end.
79,96,Gretchen,"'Mǎ.' And the word for 'scold,' which is 'mà.'"
79,97,Lauren,Which is just directly falling.
79,98,Gretchen,"'Mà.' There are four tones in Mandarin. For the particular syllable 'ma,' each of them corresponds to a word. But you could have other syllables where there happens to be a gap, and in this particular tone combined with this particular syllable, there isn't a word that corresponds to that gap, whereas you don't have something like in English, 'Oh, we just never say this word with question intonation. You can't question this word. No one ever questions peanuts. They just don't get questioned.'"
79,99,Lauren,"Because the tone is so integral to the meaning of the word, tone is often much more likely to be expressed in the writing system if a language does have a writing system."
79,100,Gretchen,"Both the Mandarin-type thing where the tone changes the meaning of the word and the English-type thing where the tone affects the meaning of the whole phrase, they're both drawing on a similar resource at the acoustic level in terms of how the pitch melody changes as you're producing the thing. But because they have such different functions in terms of language, they get referred to by different names. The English one is 'intonation,' and the Mandarin one is 'tone.' These are both words that crop up sometimes used a bit more loosely, but in the technical linguistic sense, 'tone' is when the meaning of the word itself changes, and 'intonation' is when the broader meaning of the word as it fits into the phrase or into the discourse changes."
79,101,Lauren,"As far as we know, every spoken language makes use of intonation. Tone is actually pretty prevalent. There're some estimates that 60-70% of the world's languages do have this word meaning-changing tone function to some extent; it's just that a lot of these languages are those languages with really small populations that you hear less about, and they're concentrated outside of the Indo-European family."
79,102,Gretchen,"With the notable exception of Mandarin and other Chinese languages -- all of which, I think, have tone -- which are not small languages."
79,103,Lauren,"There're definitely many large languages like Vietnamese and Hmong as well as, you said, the Chinese languages that have tone that are national languages -- very visible -- but also many, many of the world's smaller languages also have tone systems of some type or another."
79,104,Gretchen,"But because all languages make use of intonation somehow, if you're not already familiar with a tone language, and you're trying to learn one, sometimes people draw on the intonation resources by writing Mandarin tones using question marks and exclamation marks and things like that as a cue to bridge you over to using it for tone purposes. This can be pretty effective at a learning level."
79,105,Lauren,"Huh, yeah, I could see how that would be useful. So, for that second tone, which is rising, you could map that onto your understanding of question intonation, which is also rising."
79,106,Gretchen,"Exactly. This can be, sometimes, a notation thing that people can use to take notes with and help remember how to pronounce it. I find, for me, I haven't really tried to learn Chinese, but I've been exposed to enough of the same 'ma' example that shows up in linguistics a lot that I can now hear it and reproduce it immediately after someone has produced it, but I have a hard time retaining it in my long-term memory which tone a particular word has just because this is not something that I'm in the habit of paying attention to. But people do learn tone languages in adulthood. It's a thing that's possible. I just haven't put enough effort into it."
79,107,Lauren,Confessions.
79,108,Gretchen,"Like, there're a lot of languages. I'd like to learn them all, but you know, so many languages, so little time."
79,109,Lauren,"Beyond using your English punctuation hack to correlate to different tones, there are a variety of ways of writing especially the Mandarin tone system -- especially if you're using a Roman orthography. Some of those have been taken up more than others across different systems."
79,110,Gretchen,"I think the most common way that people write tones in Mandarin these days is just using accent marks or diacritics on the vowels. You can have the 'mā' tone being written with a flatline above the vowel. And then you can have an upwards-pointing line and a downwards-pointing line, and something that points down and then up, to match the shape of the tones."
79,111,Lauren,I think it's become a lot easier to use these diacritics above the vowel for the tone with modern computer systems. I'm very grateful that we have those to make that kind of writing system easier. But there have been some other fun proposals over the years as well.
79,112,Gretchen,"I am particularly fond of a proposal not necessarily for its practical benefit but for its interesting-ness called 'Gwoyeu Romatzyh' -- hope I'm pronouncing that right. This is a romanisation system that's based on, okay, what if we just spelled each of the tones differently using Roman letters."
79,113,Lauren,"Okay, so you spell the vowel part, which is where we hear the tone, differently depending on what the tone is?"
79,114,Gretchen,"Yeah. For example, what if you doubled the vowel -- you know, instead of 'A,' you wrote 'AA' -- to indicate one variant of tone. Or what if you put a silent R, that would be in your variety of English, after some vowels to indicate another kind of tone. Or what if you changed -- instead of writing 'NG' you wrote 'NQ' and that was another way of writing a tone. And you would know based on the spelling, 'Actually, this is different tones.'"
79,115,Lauren,"I've definitely seen Q used at the end of words as a silent -- it's not a letter, it's just indicating that it's a particular kind of low or falling tone in other languages where it was before the magic of easy computer writing systems and people were typing thing up on typewriters. I didn't realise that they've probably got that from this older Chinese system. How interesting."
79,116,Gretchen,"This is a system that was invented by this very, very cool Chinese linguist in history named Zhao Yuanren, who's my favourite guy."
79,117,Lauren,"I know Zhao from another way of transcribing Chinese tones. I didn't realise he'd come up with all these different ways. 'Zhao numbers' are where you use a set of numbers to indicate tone. I like this one because it gives you a little bit of information about what's happening with the acoustics. You have the numbers one to five -- 'one' being the lowest range in the melody that people are using and 'five' being the highest. Because these Mandarin have contours and movement, so you're falling tone is '51' because it's going from the highest to the lowest point, your rising tone is '35' because it's rising, but the rise is less than that full fall on the falling tone."
79,118,Gretchen,"That's a really elegant system because it can also work for other languages beyond just Mandarin. You could use it to describe, in principle, any tone system as long as it's either flat or just doing one transition. I guess you could put three numbers beside each other if you wanted to do rising-falling-rising-again."
79,119,Lauren,"Definitely a lot less opaque than the changing the way you spell the vowels in a word, which is probably why it stayed around a bit longer."
79,120,Gretchen,"But also, not necessarily the most practical thing because typing numbers every time you type a vowel so you can indicate what tones it has might get kind of tedious."
79,121,Lauren,"Especially because they are written superscript, which is often quite annoying to type."
79,122,Gretchen,"Especially on computers. I just love that both of these systems are by the same guy, Zhao, who is also the guy that came up with the famous Chinese sentence that illustrates the necessity of writing tone in Chinese -- he had some themes -- which is the tongue-twister sentence that's about the lion-eating poet in the stone den."
79,123,Lauren,"Ooo, this is the one where it's the same consonants and vowels and the only thing that changes is the tone, right?"
79,124,Gretchen,"Yeah, it's just all versions of 'shi' with different tones. If you write with without the tones, it's just 'shi shi shi shi shi,' and I'm not gonna do it justice by saying it out loud, but we are linking to a recording. It's a really good demonstration of the necessity for one out of the many competing systems that he invented."
79,125,Lauren,"It's worth just saying that the Chinese writing system is such that because each word has its own character, the characters are all sufficiently different. They're not based on the consonants and vowels. So, you memorise the character including its tone information. This is just something we've had to solve for more phonetic writing systems like English."
79,126,Gretchen,"Right. And for trying to transliterate Chinese into Roman characters, which is sort of the project -- he was involved with a lot of the early Romanisations in the 1930s and trying to figure out how to go about doing that. The neat thing about this poem is that it reads differently in different Chinese varieties. In Classical Chinese and in the writing system, it's coherent. In Mandarin, it's just four syllables because Mandarin's just got four tones. But in Cantonese or Hokkien, it's got 22 syllables or 15 syllables because these varieties have more tones."
79,127,Lauren,"Another tone language that went through a Romanisation process but took a different approach to writing systems was Vietnamese, which has six tones. Vietnamese has also gone with this diacritic approach where you put little additional bits of information above or below the vowel, but it's taken a very different approach to Mandarin."
79,128,Gretchen,"I've seen Vietnamese on signs or on menus and things like that, and it's really distinctive for having that little curved diacritic on the top of some of the vowels. It looks like a little backwards C or a hook. For example, in a word like 'phở,' which is a delicious noodle dish, you see the curve at the top. What I didn't realise until we were doing research for this episode was that this is actually from the interrogative question mark because Vietnamese had a lot of contact with French, which also uses question marks to indicate a rising intonation, and so this indicates a rising intonation because it was originally modelled after a question mark. They just made it really tiny and put it on the vowel."
79,129,Lauren,Huh!
79,130,Gretchen,Isn't that cute?
79,131,Lauren,"I'm used to diacritics that have a little rising bit because the intonation goes up, but I didn't realise that this was directly inspired by the rising intonation of the question mark."
79,132,Gretchen,Yeah!
79,133,Lauren,That's a good story.
79,134,Gretchen,"You've worked on Tibetan languages, right? There's tone in those?"
79,135,Lauren,"There is tone in Tibetan languages. Yolmo and Syuba, the languages I work with, have a two-tone system which only happens with some combinations of sounds. For sounds like /ma/ you can have 'má' and 'mà,' or a sound like /tə/, you can have 'tó,' which is 'rice,' and 'tò,' which is 'stone.' But there're some sounds -- like if you have a /kə/, there's only ever a high tone. Like, 'ká' is the word for 'mouth.' If you have a sound like /gə/, you'll only ever have a low tone. The tone isn't for every combination of sounds. It is depending on the environment of the consonants that it's hanging out with."
79,136,Gretchen,How do people go about writing that?
79,137,Lauren,"The languages I work with have taken the Nepali writing system, which was designed for Indo-Aryan languages but maps pretty well to their sound system, and they often include a H to indicate low tone because that low tone is kind of breathy. They have a silent H there."
79,138,Gretchen,The 'H' is not for 'high'; it's for the breathy low tone.
79,139,Lauren,Yeah. Just to be non-English about it. That word 'stone' would be T-O-H in English orthography and using the H character in Devanagari as well.
79,140,Gretchen,"Not that far off one of Zhao's proposals, in fact."
79,141,Lauren,"Not that far off one of Zhao's proposals except that I think the Q was somewhat arbitrary, and the H does correlate with this kind of /h/ vibe to the vowel that the low tone brings. But for Tibetan languages that are written with the Tibetan script, what's really interesting is the script doesn't have anything about tone because it was in existence before the language developed tone. It's something that can come about in a language."
79,142,Gretchen,"So, the script is older than tone in the language itself."
79,143,Lauren,"Yeah. And so, you tend to know what words have high or low tone because it's that same kind of environment factor if it's something that is more likely to have a high tone or a low tone. But it's done with these very elaborate consonant clusters, which used to be pronounced and now aren't and have become the tone system."
79,144,Gretchen,"Sometimes, you get a silent letter like E that used to be pronounced, and at the time, it cued sound changes in the words. So, if you have something like 'mat' versus 'mate,' the E in 'mate' would at one point have cued the vowel to be different. Now, even though that letter is silent, it still cues the same sort of sound changes that it used to."
79,145,Lauren,Except that it's just doing it with tone in Tibetan. You have this nice little time capsule of how the language has changed sounds but still allows you to read tone into the language as well.
79,146,Gretchen,"One of the ways of writing tones that I think is super interesting that we've talked about on the podcast a little bit before -- just switching continents a little bit from Asia to Mexico -- is in Chatino, which was in our interview with Hilaria Cruz, which we'll link to, they've got either 14 or 11 tones depending on what you're counting. In either case, that's too much to use a diacritic accent mark-based system because that's a lot of teeny-tiny accent marks. It's also kind of a lot to use a numerical-based system because that's more than nine or ten numerals to put at the end of your syllables. Instead, they use super script letters to indicate the different tones."
79,147,Lauren,That's a good solution.
79,148,Gretchen,"They have super script A, B, C and so on to indicate the different tones that are relevant for Chatino. Sometimes, they're just written in all caps at the end of the word if the computer doesn't support super scripts. These can convey the tones that they're using."
79,149,Lauren,"While we're in the region, Zapotec is another language that has tone. It uses tone for something more grammatical. So far, we've been talking about how we change between words like 'mother' and 'horse,' or 'stone' and 'rice.' They're completely different words that are unrelated to each other. In Zapotec, you can use three different tones to create differences in the grammar of the language."
79,150,Gretchen,The difference between 'I will write' and 'You will write' -- there's a suffix that's added on to mean 'I.' And then a high tone also gets added near the beginning of the word to go with that suffix which indicates I'm doing it as opposed to you're doing it.
79,151,Lauren,This use of tone for grammatical things like tense or negation is also incredibly common across Central and Southern African languages as well.
79,152,Gretchen,"There's an example from Dinka, which is a language spoken in Sudan, where the tone is the thing that makes a difference between the meanings of the following four sentences. One is 'I hate Acol,' which looks like a person's name. Two is 'Acol has been hated.'"
79,153,Lauren,"So, we're moving who is doing the hating and making it a passive."
79,154,Gretchen,Right. Or 'You hate Acol' -- also yet another tone.
79,155,Lauren,"Changing it from 'I' to 'you,' so changing the subject."
79,156,Gretchen,And then 'Acol is hated.'
79,157,Lauren,"Oh, the present passive as opposed to past passive. I feel really sorry for Acol."
79,158,Gretchen,"Yeah, I dunno who Acol is. I don't know why they keep showing up in these examples sentences and why people hate them so much, but grammatically it's very interesting."
79,159,Lauren,"Indeed. The only thing that's changing is the tone on the verb 'hate,' and that's creating different forms of the verb."
79,160,Gretchen,"It's doing a lot of really interesting grammatical things in terms of changing important parts of the meaning. The use of tone for grammatical purposes, like changing it from 'I do something' to 'This has been done' or changing something from 'I did it' to 'You did it,' this gets lumped in together with tone in general -- the use of tone to distinguish between one word and another word. I think that's just because languages that use tone for grammatical purposes also use it to distinguish between individual words."
79,161,Lauren,There's an incredibly wide range of ways in which especially languages like Dinka can use tone for a whole heap of different grammatical functions and word-changing functions.
79,162,Gretchen,"That brings us to 'Okay, if the majority of the world's spoken languages have tone, and all the world's spoken languages have intonation, what happens when you're trying to do something like, say, ask a question, which often comes with a characteristic intonation, and also your language has individual tones on the individual words?'"
79,163,Lauren,"The answer is: it depends on how the tone system works, and how that comes together with intonation. Let's look at some contrasting examples to simplify it."
79,164,Gretchen,You mean we're not gonna run through every single language in the world and exactly how its tone and intonation systems work together?
79,165,Lauren,"Well, I've only researched one. I'm gonna start with that one."
79,166,Gretchen,"All right. Well, tell us about that one."
79,167,Lauren,"This is one of those 'I kind of messed something up and it turned out to be for the best' stories. We wanted to collect some tone data for Syuba, and so I asked some speakers to read out some word lists. I thought I was trying to be pretty good at preventing them from doing list intonation because that would get in the way of the tones. But for one or two speakers, we really didn't do as good a job. It's very hard when you're recording long lists and it's been long days. We had one or two speakers where there was this really strong list intonation."
79,168,Gretchen,"In English, list intonation would be something like if you're reading 'Apples, bananas, oranges, ice cream, cake,' and each of those words is like, 'There's another word in this list.'"
79,169,Lauren,"Yes. You have this little rise at the end. That's what I was getting in these recordings. But it turned out to be really useful because it showed us that intonation overruled tone in Syuba for speakers. That's not a problem because there are only two tones. Not all words have a contrasting tone pair. Tone is not doing as much heavy work in meaning, and intonation can take over from it."
79,170,Gretchen,"Sometimes, when you have a language with more tones, the tone and intonation interact with each other. Say you're trying to put higher intonation at the end of a sentence for a question. That might just make every tone a little bit higher compared to what it would've been if it wasn't a question. You can still hear that the tones are doing slightly different things."
79,171,Lauren,"You see this with musical pitch as well. How a language is sung, the tone system might -- again, with Syuba, speakers are very happy to just make the words fit into a melody because the melody of the music is more important -- and not that there're many songs about stones and rice, but if you were singing a song, you'd probably know if someone was talking about rice or talking about stones. You don't need the tone to give you that information."
79,172,Gretchen,"Ooo, can I talk about my favourite example of this?"
79,173,Lauren,Sure.
79,174,Gretchen,This is a difference between Mandarin and Cantonese.
79,175,Lauren,Okay.
79,176,Gretchen,"Both of which have tones, but Mandarin has four and Cantonese has six or nine depending on how you count. In Mandarin, it's long been customary in music to not really pay attention to the relationship of tone and meaning, and context is just enough to fill it in."
79,177,Lauren,A bit like Yolmo and Syuba.
79,178,Gretchen,"Yeah, whereas in Cantonese, there's a long history in Cantonese opera, which is carried into Cantonese pop, of matching the tones to the notes."
79,179,Lauren,"Again, that makes complete sense if that's the priority your language has."
79,180,Gretchen,"Right. This is largely relative, at least in pop songs. If the next note in the song is lower in pitch, then you want the word to be lower in tone. Or if it's rising in pitch, you want it to be higher in tone -- the next word -- and just sort of continue along that melody. But this comes into problems if you're trying to translate songs, and you've already got a melody, and you've already got a sense of what the word meaning you want is. If you are, for example -- and this has happened -- a Christian missionary going to China translating the meanings, the lyrics to hymns --"
79,181,Lauren,Hymns that have existing melodies already that you probably don't wanna change.
79,182,Gretchen,"Nope, that you probably don't wanna change, and you have a general vibe to the words already that you're not super keen on changing either, you can end up with really funny things because if the tone mismatches, people interpret the words as something different. The example that I have is a hymn that was intending to say, 'I am the sheep of the lord,' turned into something that sounded like, 'I am a pig's face.'"
79,183,Lauren,Not quite the same vibe.
79,184,Gretchen,"No. Because apparently 'lord' and 'pig' are the same syllables, the same consonant-vowel combination, but with different tones on them. So, this is a confusion that comes up maybe kind of a lot."
79,185,Lauren,A very good lesson for those working with tone languages doing translation.
79,186,Gretchen,Make sure to do cultural consultation if you wanna translate song lyrics.
79,187,Lauren,"Throughout this whole episode, we've been talking about high and low tone and giving examples and mapping that onto ways of talking about sound that we're used to from music and from melody, but it's worth just saying very briefly that this is a cultural metaphor that we have when we're talking about sounds."
79,188,Gretchen,"Oh, yeah, I guess it is."
79,189,Lauren,Going back to our interview with Professor Suzy Styles about how we think about physically abstract things like sounds in terms of spatial realities and using highness and lowness as a metaphor. It's not the only metaphor.
79,190,Gretchen,What other metaphors do different cultures use?
79,191,Lauren,There's a metaphor in Farsi for pitch where you have 'thin' or 'thick.'
79,192,Gretchen,Can I guess which one's thin and which one's thick to see if it maps cross-culturally?
79,193,Lauren,Have a go.
79,194,Gretchen,All right. I'm gonna say that high notes are 'thin' notes and low notes are 'thick' notes?
79,195,Lauren,Yeah.
79,196,Gretchen,Excellent.
79,197,Lauren,"But 'thin' and 'thick' is their default way of talking about it. There're probably plenty of other metaphors cross-culturally. In fact, when I was learning to listen to tone in Syuba, I would talk to people about 'high' and 'low.' But one day we got ourselves into terrible confusion when I was working with one person because we were both using 'high' and 'low,' but I was using it in terms of musical pitch, and he was using it in terms of social status where what I thought of as 'high' and 'small' and 'thin,' he was thinking of 'small and thin and therefore socially inferior compared to someone who was big and round and rich.'"
79,198,Gretchen,Sitting up on a big chair.
79,199,Lauren,"Yes. So, low tone was very solid and social status and had authority, and we were using opposite high-low metaphors. I was using a spatial one; he was using a social status one. We ended up coming up with an agreement where we would just talk about whether it was the 'rice' tone or the 'stone' tone."
79,200,Gretchen,Perhaps something that doesn't necessarily translate cross-culturally as much but definitely a practical solution at the time.
79,201,Lauren,Side-stepping any cultural metaphors that either of us were using.
79,202,Gretchen,That's great.
79,203,Lauren,"I like it because it explains this confusion that we both talked about earlier on about whether one was a high tone or a low tone. It depends on whether you're thinking of one as solitary and small, tiny unit, and therefore high, or if you're thinking about it as big and grand."
79,204,Gretchen,Sort of the baseline that other things build up from or something like that.
79,205,Lauren,Yeah.
79,206,Gretchen,"Going back to our metaphor of playing the same melody on a small instrument, like a piccolo, or a large instrument like an oboe, maybe we could also talk about 'small' tone versus 'large' tone. We could even see how many possible different tone metaphors we can come up with."
79,207,Lauren,I think there's still a lot that we can learn across different languages for how they think and talk about tone and intonation.
79,208,Gretchen,We could try to make a list of how many different possible tone and intonation metaphors we can come up with. [Music]

80,1,Gretchen,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics! I'm Gretchen McCulloch."
80,2,Lauren,"I'm Lauren Gawne. Today, we're getting enthusiastic about word magic. But first, people often ask us to recommend books about linguistics that don't assume prior knowledge of linguistics, so we've come up with a list of 12 books plus a few bonuses, including both nonfiction as well as some fiction books with some linguistically interesting elements."
80,3,Gretchen,"Social media's in an interesting state of flux these days, which, as someone who studies online interaction, I find very interesting. However, not unrelated to that, we like to encourage people to sign up for emails from us in case everything else just melts down."

[Music]"
80,7,Gretchen,"Speaking of books, I've read some linguistically interesting books lately!"
80,8,Lauren,We realised that a common thread between some of the books we've been reading was this link of magic.
80,9,Gretchen,"Specifically, I love the way that books about magic are also often really linguistically interesting because saying the word and casting the magic spell are so intertwined when it comes to our conception of how magic works. Actually, 'magic spell' and 'spelling a word' -- etymologically, I've just look this up, and these have a common root."
80,10,Lauren,"I have never thought about it, but that is, I guess, not surprising because spells are words."
80,11,Gretchen,"Yeah, they're both from Middle English 'spel,' from Old English 'spell,' which is a story, a saying, a tale, a history, a narrative, and related to other Germanic languages. By around the 1500s, there's this magical link as well. Interestingly, and this is why it always pays to look up your etymologies, neither of them is related to 'spell' as in 'to work for a spell' or 'to rest for a spell.' That is a totally different 'spell.'"
80,12,Lauren,"Okay. This is why it's good to check because I would've just assumed they were related. I am delighted that the writing-down-words 'spell,' the language is older than the magic."
80,13,Gretchen,"Well, reading and writing is also a kind of magic. It's a way of preserving words as they're written down."
80,14,Lauren,I also seem to remember that 'grammar' and 'glamour' are related etymologically as well.
80,15,Gretchen,"That is true. 'Glamour' comes through Scottish. I first encountered this in another book, Susan Cooper's The Dark is Rising where you have this magical 'Book of Gramarye,' which you read and learn about all of these interesting things, some of which is where the stars are, which is this very rooted kind of magic, and some of which is how to make things blow up or go on fire or these other types of magical things."
80,16,Lauren,Definitely a very interesting grammar book. Maybe slightly different to the grammar books that we read in the non-magical world.
80,17,Gretchen,It does give me an over-inflated idea of what my copy of the Cambridge Grammar of the English Language is gonna teach me how to do.
80,18,Lauren,"But this relationship between language and spell casting and magic and fantasy means that it's not that surprising that, as well as a link between language and magic and spells in the three books that we're looking at today, there's also a link of educational settings -- people at school or university learning how to do magic through language."
80,19,Gretchen,"The first book that we wanna talk about is Babel by R. F. Kuang, which is this really interesting book that's set in a fantasy Oxford setting where the characters are going to school, learning how to do this type of magic. The magic there is embedded on silver bars. The premise is, is that on either side of the silver bar, you engrave a word, and those two words are in different languages. They mean something very, very, very similar but not identical. It's the slight difference in the meaning, the impossibility of translation -- this book has so much translation theory that's just very cool."
80,20,Lauren,"There're parts of this book where the professor is teaching them translation theory, and I'm like, 'This is a lecture that I would have sat through,' maybe with slightly less 18th-19th Century, like, professor, but actually not that different."
80,21,Gretchen,"This idea that true translation is always gonna be a tiny bit different means that when you have two words on either side of the silver bar, the tension between the meanings and the little bit of meaning that escapes translation is the part that creates the magic, which is such a cool idea."
80,22,Lauren,I like that R. F. Kuang really takes the time to tease out what those translational differences are.
80,23,Gretchen,"The first example in the book is a bar that has on one side 'triacle,' which is from French but I think got borrowed into Old English, and on the other side, the Modern English word 'treacle,' which is not as familiar to North Americans, but it's a sort of a molasses-like thing that's very common in British fantasy novels and also real-life Brits."
80,24,Lauren,I always think of it as an ingredient in a baked sweet pudding.
80,25,Gretchen,"I dunno if I have the baked sweet pudding category of item, but I think of a treacle tart. But the meaning of 'triacle' in French is an antidote for a poison or venom, or a medicine for drawing out or neutralising a poison. In English, of course, it's just like, 'Here's this nice, sweet syrup,' and the antidote is also supposed to be quite sweet, I guess, but it's the tension between these meanings where one of them means 'antidote' and the other one doesn't that makes this bar able to neutralise poisons or infections. Of course, thinking of examples like this and the possibility of translation made me think, 'What would I do if I was trying to come up with a bar that had an interesting translation pair on it?' Do you have one that you'd do, Lauren?"
80,26,Lauren,"I have been thinking about this ever since I read Babel, and I think, to throw back to our scales and implicature episode, that I would have a silver bar that had the English word 'hot' and the Nepali word 'tato' because Nepali has two different words for 'hot,' and one is specifically for hot liquids or beverages. So, outside when it's warm, it's 'garmi,' but when my tea is hot, it's 'tato.' Hopefully, having the silver bar means that my tea will never cool down when I put it down and forget about it for 30 minutes."
80,27,Gretchen,"I mean, all of these connections seem very obvious when they were in the pages of the book, but this makes me wonder if the difference between the Nepali word and the English word is that it applies to a liquid specifically. Maybe it would make things into liquids? I feel like I'd like to test this magical system out a little bit empirically."
80,28,Lauren,I do remember there were some very funny situations -- or highly dangerous situations -- where an attempted friction in the translation has led to not quite the intended consequences.
80,29,Gretchen,"From a linguistic world building perspective, something else that's very important in Babel is that the characters need to have deep knowledge of the language in order to have the feeling of this translation tension that's held in their minds which makes the magic work."
80,30,Lauren,"So, I couldn't get away with using or creating that 'treacle/triacle' combination because I'm not a French speaker."
80,31,Gretchen,"I speak French relatively well, but I've just read the definition of 'triacle' in a dictionary and been like, 'Oh, okay, that makes sense,' but I don't actually know that intimately through my own experience, so I wouldn't be able to hold that in mind."
80,32,Lauren,"There's a really, I think, quite distressing plot point -- and I should say, this book's subtitle is 'Babe"
80,33,Lauren,"Or the Necessity of Violence,' so it does give you a sense that this is quite a dark and heavy book about the realities of colonisation and the British Empire. There is one character who, to me, is a really tragic figure who's taken away from one of the languages he speaks very early on in his life. He still speaks it, but he doesn't speak it really in a way that he feels really confident and immersed in that knowledge. That affects his ability to do this translation magic."
80,34,Gretchen,"The whole theme of the book itself is, okay, well, these English-speaking magicians have mined through French and Latin and some of the more readily available languages to them and come up with most of the spells that are possible from those. They've gone out searching through the rest of empire to basically plunder children who speak other languages and say, 'Hey, you, you can come up with some cool magic based on Chinese' or based on another language that we don't have access to. This, you know, has some predictably complicated, violent consequences."
80,35,Lauren,"This need to have deep knowledge of and really lived the words that you're using in doing your magic reminds me of Carry On by Rainbow Rowell, which has a slightly different magic system and is part of a set of three books: Carry On, Wayward Son, and Any Way the Wind Blows."
80,36,Gretchen,"In these, all the magic is in English, but there's still this connection to having the deep, intimate knowledge of the language and, particularly, the language as it exists in community. Some of the phrases that are used as magical phrases are things like, 'Out, out damned spot,' which can clean things, or 'Into thin air,' which can make something disappear, or 'Some like it hot,' which can melt something. At one point, the headmaster in the book explains that the magical students need to keep living in regular society because the idioms that these spells are formed of lose their power if people stop knowing what they mean."
80,37,Lauren,You have to be really up with your pop culture references and your pithy one-liners to be able to do magic in this world.
80,38,Gretchen,"You can get new spells out of a new pop culture reference that people start recognising or a new song lyric, things like 'Carry on' and 'Any way the wind blows' are from the Queen song 'Bohemian Rhapsody,' and this can create new phrases that can accomplish magic based on other people being able to recognise them. That's language as embodied in a whole community of people not just in the mind of one person, which is the different vision for where language is."
80,39,Lauren,I like to think that the reason that people love to crack out 'Bohemian Rhapsody' at the end of a night of karaoke is because the magical witches and wizards of this world have created this as a thing we do to keep 'Bohemian Rhapsody' alive so that they can still keep making spells like 'Carry on' or 'Any way the wind blows.'
80,40,Gretchen,"Head canon accepted. I buy this. But I think there is a certain magic to everyone knowing the words to a song because you have this connection with people that you might not otherwise know very well that, like, here's this thing that you can all participate in."
80,41,Lauren,"In some ways, memes really do feel like magic, whether it's a spoken meme like a phrase or a picture meme. When you get it and someone else gets it, it just feels really satisfying."
80,42,Gretchen,"Yeah. Rather than magic coming from this point of tension between two meanings, it's also magic coming from this point of connection of someone else knowing what something means. That's very different to the third book or series that's on our list, which is A Deadly Education and its sequels in the Scholomance series: The Last Graduate and the Golden Enclaves, by Naomi Novik."
80,43,Lauren,'School' here is a little less stay-in-the-real-world than Rainbow Rowell's Carry On books in that the school is automated. There are no teachers. The students are just trapped in this magic school that has some Hunger Games vibes sometimes.
80,44,Gretchen,"The premise of this series is that the world is very dangerous. There are terrifying magical creatures all over the world, and they especially go after young, magical humans between the ages of I think it's around 11 and 17, sort of teenagers."
80,45,Lauren,"'Mmm, magically tasty.'"
80,46,Gretchen,"'Mmm, yummy, yummy, young magical humans.' For their own protection, they're put behind the walls of this school, and yet, occasionally, magical beings will still get into the school and try to attack the students. Hopefully, the students will manage to defend themselves against these beasts but, you know, who knows. It's sort of terrifying. The school themself -- or the school 'itself,' I dunno --"
80,47,Lauren,The school definitely has a personality.
80,48,Gretchen,"The school itself is trying to teach them by recommending books and throwing books at them and doing other types of -- they do a language lab thing where they have recorders, and they put headphones on, and they try to learn bits of languages so they can understand these spell books which are in all sorts of languages."
80,49,Lauren,"You have to be careful because as soon as you start looking at a French book or maybe glance at a French poem, the school will be like, 'You are gonna learn French.' It may just serve you French classes for a semester."
80,50,Gretchen,"More dangerously, it may just send you spell books in French, and you're like, 'Uh, oh, excuse me, I've really just read one verb, and you now think I can just do spells in French. I can't even say these words yet.'"
80,51,Lauren,It's definitely very dangerous for those of us who have a habit of browsing the grammars of different languages for fun.
80,52,Gretchen,"Oh, no. Yeah, I saw this, and I was like, 'This would be very dangerous for me personally.' But the fun thing from a linguistic perspective is that it's also not just constrained to contemporary languages. Our point of view character, whose name is 'El Higgins' -- 'El' short for 'Galadriel' -- is learning Old English and even wanders into the shelves of Proto-Indo-European spells, which definitely made me perk up linguistically."
80,53,Lauren,"I got very excited about this because there was no world in which a shelf of Proto-Indo-European books exists because this is a language that is the common ancestor language of most of the languages of Europe all the way through to Southeast Asia. Nepali is also part of this family. Proto-Indo-European was spoken thousands of years ago by a nomadic group. We have somewhat pieced it together through our best guesses going backwards through time, but there are no records of Proto-Indo-European."
80,54,Gretchen,"We've pieced together a couple hundred words, out of which you can construct a paragraph or two as long as you wanna talk about sheep. It's not something where we have a lot of knowledge to be able to write entire books but, you know, if this magical school has existed for thousands and thousands of years, then maybe it does have some books that are in this language that we don't know actually know anything about."
80,55,Lauren,"Unfortunately, El just wanders straight past that shelf, and we never find out."
80,56,Gretchen,"Sigh. But there's also something that's very different about the conception of language from this book -- and it's part of the themes of the book -- which is the idea of language as trap or language as sufficiency where you don't need to know the language in any great degree of fluency as long as you can perform the literal bits of the spell itself and put enough effort into doing so, that's what's gonna create the magical effect, which is, again, a third conception of how language is."
80,57,Lauren,"I had a real throwback to a high school Italian poetry recital competition that my school made us do where most of the students had no idea what they were reciting, but some of them could recite it very impressively."
80,58,Gretchen,"You see this with singers sometimes, too. Like, opera singers will sometimes learn a song in a particular language they don't necessarily speak and just learn, okay, here's how to pronounce it, and here's the general vibe of this is a love song, or this is tragic, or this is angry, and I'm just gonna perform this very beautifully but not necessarily have any ability to carry on a conversation or even say, 'Hello/Goodbye,' in that language."
80,59,Lauren,I feel like having a knowledge of the International Phonetic Alphabet could potentially give you an edge in the Scholomance school world.
80,60,Gretchen,"Something that I find really interesting when considering all three of these series, all three of these worlds as a whole, is that each of them has to have a theory of what it means to know a language in order for their system of magic, what it means to cast a spell, to work."
80,61,Lauren,"In all three of these series, there're times where spells do not work in ways that are catastrophic for our heroes."
80,62,Gretchen,"And having those constraints and limitations on what language can do and what magic can do is also part of what makes the plots interesting. I guess it's also funny to me that given that 'spell' and 'spell' -- you know, 'spell' as in writing and 'spell' as in magic -- have the same root that writing down the words in none of these cases is the power. It's speaking it out loud that's the thing that ignites them working."
80,63,Lauren,This makes me very pleased because there're so many languages in our world that don't have a writing system whether that's because they're one of the many languages that just have an oral tradition or signed languages don't have a stable writing system that's generally used by the whole population of signers.
80,64,Gretchen,"Right. But they could still be performed and enacted and presumably made spells of, although we don't see it in any of these particular books what that would actually look like to be able to sign a spell."
80,65,Lauren,There's no reason based on the mechanisms that are used that they couldn't be used to make spells.
80,66,Gretchen,"There are ways of performing and embodying words in real life that also let real words have certain types of magic, at least, or I guess effects on the situation that exists in a world."
80,67,Lauren,"Gretchen, words can change reality."
80,68,Gretchen,"That's not just like, 'Oh, if I describe the beauty of the sky, that makes me notice it more,' although that's true, too, but there's a specific type of phrases or of utterances that saying them changes something about the word. If I say, 'I promise that I will give you $5.00,' the world is now different from before I made that promise."
80,69,Lauren,Yeah. Because I'm gonna get $5.00.
80,70,Gretchen,You're welcome.
80,71,Lauren,"I think the canonical example that gets rolled out when we talk about performatives a lot is if you go to a wedding -- and this is one of my favourite reasons to go to a wedding -- is that moment where the two people are asked, 'Do you take this person to be your lawfully wedded wife,' they will say, 'I do.' You have to say that. It is a legal part of a Western marriage ceremony. Different marriage traditions have different traditions, but in a Western marriage ceremony, you have to say, 'I do,' to make that legally binding."
80,72,Gretchen,In front of witnesses.
80,73,Lauren,In front of witnesses.
80,74,Gretchen,"And you sign some sort of marriage contract afterwards, which is the written part of that performance, but it's the saying it out loud in front of witnesses that also makes that thing the case."
80,75,Lauren,"It's the person officiating the ceremony that says, 'I declare you wife and wife,' or 'I declare you husband and wife,' that makes the ceremony entirely legally bond. And again, they have to say these very specific words in a very specific way depending on the legal jurisdiction in which you're getting married."
80,76,Gretchen,"This gets us to something which is part of the saying the words. It's not enough for you to just say on the podcast like, 'I declare these two people wife and wife' because you are not currently officiating a wedding. The power is not granted to you. You don't have two people standing in front of you saying, 'I do.' That's not a power that you have right now even though you can say the little phrase. Or if you're in a movie of a wedding, you have not necessarily legally married the two people who are getting married in the movie."
80,77,Lauren,"Oops, those two actors are now accidentally married irl because they got married in a movie."
80,78,Gretchen,"I feel like this has maybe happened at some point. Part of the saying a particular phrase is also saying that phrase in particular contexts or under a particular set of conditions, which makes it possible for that to happen."
80,79,Lauren,"There's a technical term for this that doesn't require you to remember it for this to work, but I think it's just worth talking about. These conditions are known as 'felicity conditions.' I just think this is a very excellent drag name. If you're looking for a drag name, can I recommend 'Felicity Conditions.'"
80,80,Gretchen,"New, good linguistics drag name. I think it's certainly better than 'Grammaticality Judgement,' which doesn't quite have the same ring to it."
80,81,Lauren,I just imagine Felicity Conditions walking around looking fabulous trying to get everyone married.
80,82,Gretchen,Other types of things that you can say that have an effect on the world are things like naming things. 'I name this ship the Queen Elizabeth.'
80,83,Lauren,"I can't. I have tried to. I have tried to walk up to so many ships with so many bottles of champaign, and the felicity conditions are never met because I do not have this power."
80,84,Gretchen,But you do have the power to name two children.
80,85,Lauren,"Yes, I have named children. You don't always have to say out loud. We did have to sign some paperwork. Writing has taken over from speaking in some legal domains."
80,86,Gretchen,"But if you name a pet, still, that's something that's just sort of your say so that's generally not -- you know, you go to the vet, and they say, 'What's the name of this pet?', and you just say like, 'Max' or 'Fido' or something."
80,87,Lauren,'Felicity Conditions.'
80,88,Gretchen,"'My cat, Felicity Conditions.'"
80,89,Lauren,'It's Felix the cat -- short for 'Felicity Conditions.''
80,90,Gretchen,"[Laughs] Oh my god. And nicknames are an example where the nickname exists because people use it. It's not anywhere on a written document, but you can say, 'This is what I wanna be called.' Many online names are names because people just call you that. It's you saying, 'This is my name,' and other people saying, 'Yeah, we'll call you that,' that makes the name exist more so than the paperwork."
80,91,Lauren,"Bets are also a form of performative language. Any time you make a wager and say, 'I bet that.'"
80,92,Gretchen,I am going to bet you that someone will actually name their cat 'Felicity Conditions' and tell us about it as a result of this episode.
80,93,Lauren,"Okay. And if they don't, that is how I'm gonna get my $5.00 out of you."
80,94,Gretchen,"If they do, then you have to buy me ice cream. If they don't, then I buy you ice cream."
80,95,Lauren,"Okay. It seems like we all win in this situation. We've now created a condition in the world that did not exist before this conversation, which is that we have an ice cream-based bet between us."
80,96,Gretchen,"It is up to you, the listeners, as to who has to buy who ice cream."
80,97,Lauren,"In this situation, the conditions are that both of us have the authority to speak for ourselves. Both of us have the authority to purchase ice cream should be bet be completed satisfactorily. We've met the conditions for this to be a proper performative interaction. We've changed the world."
80,98,Gretchen,"If only we knew it was so easy to change the world. These types of statements that change the world are known as 'performative utterances.' They were first described by a linguist, a philosopher, named J. L. Austin in 1962. Some of the examples are also a little bit 1962. One of them is 'I bet you sixpence it will rain tomorrow.' You're like, 'Oh, sixpence, all right.'"
80,99,Lauren,I don't think we can meet that because I don't think I have access to sixpence.
80,100,Gretchen,"I don't know if sixpences exist anymore because when British currency underwent decimalisation, now they have six new pennies, but it's not a sixpence coin."
80,101,Lauren,"I could probably find a sixpence coin, but it wouldn't mean a lot to transact that bet."
80,102,Gretchen,"You could buy it on eBay or something, but yeah, it wouldn't necessarily have that effect on the world."
80,103,Lauren,"'I give and bequeath my watch to my brother,' as though watches are the kind of things that are very important to keep in a will and testament."
80,104,Gretchen,"Another fun example of these types of performative utterances -- voting. You can say, 'I vote for so-and-so,' 'I vote for Felicity Conditions as the winner of this drag race.' Before the secret ballot was invented, you actually voted by going up to somebody who was recording the votes and saying, 'Here's who I vote for,' and declaring it."
80,105,Lauren,"Hmm. Again, this interesting transition between a spoken performative utterance and moving to performing your intention through writing."
80,106,Gretchen,"Another really fun -- well, another less-fun type of performative utterance is 'declare war.'"
80,107,Lauren,"Yes, less fun."
80,108,Gretchen,"But it's still a type of performative. One country has to officially declare themselves to be in a state of war. It's not enough to merely do some fighting. There's a legal state that countries are in when they say, 'This is officially war.'"
80,109,Lauren,"In terms of felicity conditions, there are a whole set of international regulations and conditions and contexts around how one does that. Since I'm not the leader of a nation state, that is not available to me, which is fine. I have no intention of declaring war on anyone."
80,110,Gretchen,"I cannot simply declare war on Australia. That's not how any of this works, thank goodness."
80,111,Lauren,"No, thankfully."
80,112,Gretchen,"In more innocuous kinds, you can say, 'I would like to announce that this episode of Lingthusiasm is about performatives,' or 'I hereby demonstrate a performative utterance.'"
80,113,Lauren,That is nice. I also like that you've used the word 'hereby' because in English that's a pretty good little test for whether something is a performative or not.
80,114,Gretchen,"Right. If you can put 'hereby' into the sentence, you know, 'I hereby promise,' or 'I hereby name,' 'I hereby vote for so-and-so.'"
80,115,Lauren,'I hereby bet you.'
80,116,Gretchen,Right. Then it's a type of performance because you're doing it by saying it.
80,117,Lauren,"Another context in which performatives and performativity is often discussed is around how people do gender, which is not necessarily just language."
80,118,Gretchen,"This comes from Judith butler's book Gender Trouble. They were actually inspired by the linguistics concept of performativity. It's not just a stage or theatrical performance, but it's because Butler had read Austin and was like, 'Yeah, actually, gender is something that you do and that you make more gendered by continuing to do.'"
80,119,Lauren,"In some ways, every time a person reinforces a way of doing gender by doing something within that culture with gender, you are continuing to shape reality as well. That's also part of how it's inspired by performative utterances."
80,120,Gretchen,"If you give someone a complement for being beautiful, and that person is a woman, then you are reassociating that link between 'beautiful' as a gendered type of compliment. If you are complimenting someone who's a woman, and you're seeing them as a man, then that's performing gender in a slightly different way of saying, 'I wanna try to delink these things.'"
80,121,Lauren,"Every time you choose pink for a girl and blue for a boy, you're continuing this Western focus on these colours being representative of these genders for babies even though these are relatively new ways of doing that. Those colours were flipped only a century or two ago."
80,122,Gretchen,"It's interesting to see how gender is something that we receive from other peoples' performances, but it's also something we participate in and keep reinforcing by ourselves doing it, and so it's performed."
80,123,Lauren,"So, a slightly different sense of performativity but one that was really inspired by this earlier work from linguistics. The way that words, specifically, have power as performatives is something we can kind of see in the way we communicate with words and language and the way we communicate with gestures have slightly different weights in terms of their ability to be meaningful and powerful for people. My colleague, Kensy Cooperrider, has this really neat example of when you're sitting in the emergency row of an aircraft, and the airstaff come and talk to you about how to operate the doors and whether you feel comfortable doing this in the case of an emergency, which I always take very seriously, and they tell you to take it very seriously, and at the end of this, they say, 'Do you agree to do this? If you don't, we can move you.' You have to say, 'Yes.' A nod is not sufficiently performative of your acceptance of this role in case of the emergency that statistically almost never manifests but you have to take very seriously as a possibility every time you fly."
80,124,Gretchen,They need specifically to say this particular thing because you're entering into a type of contract with them.
80,125,Lauren,"In the context of at home, 'Would you like a coffee,' a nod is a sufficient consent to consuming coffee. In this context, it's a much more serious context, and the seriousness promotes this need to have words rather than just a gesture or nod to confirm your agreement."
80,126,Gretchen,"I sometimes think about this in terms of how technology has also shaped how we perform certain types of things because there's a thing that people often do in texting where you're performing a particular type of action. Let's say your friend is having a hard day, and you send them a text about it, whether you say something like, 'I wish I could give you a hug right now,' or 'Giving you a hug,' or just sort of like, '*hugs you*' as narrating the action that you're doing, all of these are not quite the same as doing a physical hug, but they're ways of making it more like a real hug or not or making it more vivid or more, yeah, closer to the physical thing."
80,127,Lauren,"One of the things we've been coming back to is this tension between spoken language having a lot of power and written language not necessarily always having that same power to create whether it's fictional-world magic or real-world magic. It's really interesting. In some cultures, different emphasis is put on writing. Increasingly in Western culture with the centrality of writing and the prevalence of literacy, you see that signatures are increasingly more important than a verbal agreement. It's not the saying, 'I give my brother my watch,' that's important, it's the writing it down in a will and signing it in a way that meets the conditions, which comes from that older verbal tradition but has moved into writing returning to dominance as the central way of making it happen."
80,128,Gretchen,"Before writing was the dominant technology, you would say something out loud in front of witnesses, and then those witnesses would be the people who were instantiating the contract of 'Okay, these people have agreed. I've seen it.' And then you have the witnesses signing it to say, 'I have seen this person do this. This has been witnessed.' As technology continues, you also have this phenomenon of a 'wet signature.'"
80,129,Lauren,What's a 'wet signature'?
80,130,Gretchen,It sounds kind of gross.
80,131,Lauren,I don't want one.
80,132,Gretchen,This is a retronym for the conventional kind of signature where the ink of the pen is wet compared to a digital signature.
80,133,Lauren,"Which is not wet because it's digital ink not real ink. Oh, so I do have a wet signature. It's when I sign something with a pen as opposed to signing a PDF."
80,134,Gretchen,"Right. The original idea behind signing something with a pen is that your signature is related to your handwriting, and no one else should be able to write exactly the same way as you and you can compare the signature that purports to be from you with your actual signature and be like, 'Look, this person doesn't know how I sign my name.' But in the digital context, if you have an image of someone's signature, you could just put it on another digital document, and it's just sort of there as part of this artefact of things that we have agreed to accept is the form of a contract but no longer actually requires the person who's signing it to be the person who has that. I have a copy of my digital signature that I just keep using. I don't create it new each time."
80,135,Lauren,"But each time you are putting it on a document, that becomes the performance of agreeing to the terms of the document."
80,136,Gretchen,"Exactly. And an oath -- swearing an oath -- you know, 'I solemnly swear to tell the truth,' or 'I swear that this is, in fact, what I have seen,' or 'This is what I saw,' that's also related to a performative. You know, 'I hereby swear that this is what happened last night,' and that's part of this contract thing that's a performative."
80,137,Lauren,"Oaths are also related to curses in the non-magical sense. If you curse someone or if you curse using swear language, you are creating a sentiment about whatever you're talking about."
80,138,Gretchen,"Swearing or using other types of taboo language, those are words that change the state of the world because, compared to using a more neutral equivalent, they are a way of saying, 'I am the type of person who uses this highly emotively charged language compared to a more neutral synonym that I could be using.'"
80,139,Lauren,This is the reason that we don't swear on main episodes of the podcast because we know the effect that it can have.
80,140,Gretchen,"Although, if you do want to hear us swear, we have done a couple bonus episodes about swearing that are locked up nice and safe where kids can't get them. It's something that does exist, which is an interesting pragmatic choice that we made when we started Lingthusiasm, which was we want this podcast to be something that people could feel comfortable assigning to high school students or playing around their children and not feeling like they have to pre-screen episodes to see what we're talking about, but also, swearing is part of language, and it's interesting to analyse. That's why we put those as bonus episodes."
80,141,Lauren,"Knowing the real-world effect that language can have on people is why we're very happy to use swears in a bonus episode, but we do draw the line at using slur words."
80,142,Gretchen,"Right. Because a swear word is emotionally charged but ultimately refers to things that are relatively neutral or egalitarian, whereas a slur that refers to a particular person and their membership of a group and denigrates them for that is something that, you know, is still linguistically interesting but is something that we don't want to take on the pragmatic connotations of we're the kind of people who say that about people. Something that's interesting for me is the way that some words have become more taboo and some words have become less taboo. The F-word has become less taboo even in my lifespan, whereas slurs that refer to particular groups of people, when I was young, some of them weren't as taboo as they are now. That's also us as collective humans changing what these particular words mean when they're performed. It's not something that exists in a vacuum."
80,143,Lauren,"Even though I can't make a teacup that keeps my tea permanently hot, thinking about performatives, thinking about oaths and curses and bets, is a really good way to remember that language does have the magic to change the world. [Music]"

81,5,Lauren,"Today, Gretchen, we're going on an excursion to a farm."
81,6,Gretchen,"Ooo, what are we gonna see at the farm?"
81,7,Lauren,We're gonna see all kinds of animals that we're gonna use as our example sentences. The first is this horse. The horse is eating grass
81,8,Gretchen,"Ah, look at the horse! The horse has eaten an apple."
81,9,Lauren,"Oh, what a nice treat. Both sentences 'The horse is eating grass' and 'The horse has eaten an apple' are about the verb 'eat,' but they're structured a little differently."
81,10,Gretchen,"Yeah. They've got something in common, which is that they have a main verb 'eat' -- 'is eating grass,' 'has eaten an apple' -- and also a second helping verb that's less important when it comes to how we'd draw a nice picture of the scenario but gives us some useful grammatical information."
81,11,Lauren,These verbs have their own life as well when they're not hanging out alongside another verb and helping it. 'The horse is eating grass' is the same verb as in 'The horse is an animal.' Here 'is' is doing the work of painting a picture of what's happening. The 'is' is the whole verb by itself. It doesn't have any helpers.
81,12,Gretchen,"The same thing with something like, 'The horse has an apple.'"
81,13,Lauren,"Oh, lucky horse."
81,14,Gretchen,"Lucky horse. We don't know whether it's eaten yet, but the 'has' there doesn't have any helpers. It's not helping. It's just the only verb. Whereas in 'The horse is eating grass,' 'The horse has eaten an apple,' you have 'eat,' which is your primary verb, star of the show, and then that 'is' or 'has' that's helping it out."
81,15,Lauren,And those verb-y things that are helping another verb are known as 'auxiliary verbs.'
81,16,Gretchen,"Yeah, 'auxiliary' is -- the type of terminology, like, 'Wow, that's a long word for such a short verb.'"
81,17,Lauren,Yes. It's a very fancy word for when often very short verbs are used to help another verb. It's because it's just the very fancy French borrowed word for 'help.'
81,18,Gretchen,"It's this French word which was borrowed from Latin meaning 'helpful' or 'aiding.' You do sometimes see an auxiliary, like an 'auxiliary armed force' or like a 'ladies auxiliary' in a historical military context."
81,19,Lauren,"True, yes, that is where you may have also encountered the word 'auxiliary' outside of linguistics."
81,20,Gretchen,"I wouldn't say it's super common, but there we go. Sometimes, you do see people just refer to them as 'helping words' which is also extremely defensible, but the technical, formal word that linguists use is 'auxiliary,' which is sometimes shortened nicely to 'aux' -- just A-U-X."
81,21,Lauren,"We have auxiliary verbs in English, like the examples we just shared. We can explore how auxiliary verbs work in other languages as well thanks to a very conveniently timed launch of a new database called 'Grambank.'"
81,22,Gretchen,"This is very good and coincidental timing. If you've listened to previous episodes of Lingthusiasm, you might've heard us talk about WALS, which is the World Atlas of Linguistic Structures, which does these cool diagrams of where various linguistic features are found. Grambank is sort of like the new WALS. Let's talk a little bit about -- do you know the history of how these two sites came to be?"
81,23,Lauren,WALS has been our go-to for almost 20 years. It started out in 2005 as a CD-ROM.
81,24,Gretchen,"Oh my god, I didn't realise that it used to be a CD-ROM."
81,25,Lauren,"Only came online in 2008. The way that WALS works is that an individual researcher would come up with a question, and they would survey as many grammars as they could and then share their results. The way that Grambank works is, instead, they started with almost 200 different features of how the grammar of a language can work, and then they had a massive team -- there's over 100 named authors on the Grambank big, initial publication -- and those 100+ authors went through over 2,000 different grammars of different languages looking for each of those 195 different features to put in the database. It's a very different process."
81,26,Gretchen,"That's both more questions than WALS, which has around 90-some questions and also way more languages. Generally, when you see a language map in WALS it's got maybe about 500 languages, somewhere between 400 and 800 languages, whereas there's thousands of languages in each of the Grambank databases -- not the full, maybe, 7,000 that we think exist, but 2,000-2,500 is certainly a lot closer to having some sense of 'What do things like look cross-linguistically?'"
81,27,Lauren,"To pull an example of a grammar completely not at random, one of the coders used my grammar of Lamjung Yolmo. They picked up the grammar, and they opened it up, and they literally went through their list of 195 questions looking for the answers in the grammar and added it to the database."
81,28,Gretchen,"This is, I think, such a tremendous example of how the work of linguistics involves so many different people because each of the grammars that this database is using as input -- and a database like WALS also uses as input -- is written by one person or a group of people and can be several hundred pages long and take like 5 or 10 years. Then you have another group of 100+ people spending all this time looking through the grammars and trying to compare them and extract things that make them comparable to each other when grammars are written in different traditions at different times by different people with different interests and try to do something that lets you compare them with respect to each other."
81,29,Lauren,One thing that Grambank does really well is that it's really transparent about the methods it uses. There's an entire Wiki that goes along with it that explains the process and the methods and what terminology they're using and why. I think that really helps to make sure that everyone is as much on the same page as possible when it comes to making these decisions.
81,30,Gretchen,"If you had somebody who's writing a new grammar, they could look at these 195 questions and say, 'I could just provide answers for them in an appendix' or something at the end, so you could just encode them more directly in a future version of Grambank. Are they planning on doing that?"
81,31,Lauren,"This is definitely Version 1.0. There is scope to expand both the number of features they look at the number of grammars that are included in the future, which is also really exciting."
81,32,Gretchen,"It's all freely available online, so if you wanna poke around and see what's in it, that's a thing that anybody can do."
81,33,Lauren,"WALS absolutely still has value. I'm sure that we will continue to refer to it when it's useful, but I'm excited that we'll also get to use Grambank for future episodes as well."
81,34,Gretchen,"Yeah. And they ask slightly different sets of questions, so it's still worth having both sets of resources. But since we have auxiliaries today, and since WALS doesn't do much with auxiliaries, this is a great time to say, 'What does Grambank tell us about auxiliaries in 2000+ languages?'"
81,35,Lauren,"Before we do that, we have to decide what is an auxiliary in any given language. All of those people who wrote those 2,500 references that are included in Grambank, and that means that we have to think about 'What are some of the most important features when we're talking about something as an auxiliary?'"
81,36,Gretchen,"Right. I think a basic working definition of an 'auxiliary' is that when you have multiple verbs in the same phrase like 'has eaten.' One of them contributes the most to the meaning, and other ones have grammatical function and don't really have much with their own meaning. In something like, 'The horse has an apple,' 'has' has a meaning of owning or possession or belonging to, whereas in something like, 'The horse has eaten,' it's not that the horse owns or possesses or belongs to the state of having eaten. It's an auxiliary in that case where it's helping out the other verb with grammatical functions."
81,37,Lauren,"As we're going through these examples, I think just like we might go for a wander around the hypothetical farm we're talking about today, we're also just wandering through these examples and not getting too bogged down on making a complete list. We have that list in the Cambridge Grammar of the English Language. It's a very big and heavy book."
81,38,Gretchen,"Speaking of reference works that take multiple people to do, this is also some 2,000+ pages and has 12 co-authors. There's many people at every level of this process trying to describe what's going on in a language. This is not an exhaustive tour."
81,39,Lauren,"In English, we've talked about 'is' and 'has' having auxiliary functions. We also have 'do' as in 'The horse does eat grass,' which is different to 'do' in its main form as 'The horse does a dance,' maybe for some dressage."
81,40,Gretchen,"'The horse does a little dance, does a little jump' -- that's 'do' as its canonical, by itself, independent verb form, whereas 'The horse does eat grass' is doing a grammatical thing. Similarly, with an example like 'The grass was eaten by the horse,' or maybe by a stray goat, the 'was' there is doing a grammatical thing and 'eaten' is the main verb."
81,41,Lauren,'The grass was eaten by the horse' is a really nifty example of how the auxiliary is helping by making the grass the focus and creating this passive structure.
81,42,Gretchen,"Right. Sometimes, 'The horse is eating grass,' or 'The horse has eaten grass,' this locates the event of grass-eating in time and the timeline of how this event has happened. Sometimes, it can change how the entities in the sentence relate to each other. There's lots of different things that auxiliaries can do."
81,43,Lauren,"Another example of what auxiliaries can do that's not from my variety of English is 'The horse be eating grass' in African American Vernacular English, where instead of the 'is' form of the verb, you have the 'be' form. That means that it's being used in a way that means the horse regularly or habitually eats grass."
81,44,Gretchen,Which I think is a true thing about horses.
81,45,Lauren,I think so. Neither of us are particularly horse experts.
81,46,Gretchen,"One of the papers that I like to cite about this construction which is called, 'Habitual 'be',' uses 'Cookie Monster be eating cookies' as the example, which is definitely true about cookie monsters. Even if Cookie Monster is not currently eating cookies, this is a thing that is habitually true about Cookie Monster as an entity."
81,47,Lauren,That's a really helpful auxiliary.
81,48,Gretchen,"It's interesting how auxiliaries are often drawn from this relatively limited set of words. Here, we've seen 'be' and 'is,' which are part of the same verb, be used in three different ways as slightly different flavours of auxiliary in English because it's this small set of auxiliaries, and then you can do all these interesting grammatical things with them."
81,49,Lauren,"There're all these downstream effects of what happens when you have an auxiliary. Because it's being used to help in terms of what it's contributing to the grammar, it means that it's not coming along with its own meaning as central. Because they no longer bring their own meaning while they're helping, you get sentences which, if you don't treat them as an auxiliary, sound a little bit contradictory. So, 'I am going to come to the farm,' because 'going' is the auxiliary there, you can use it with 'come,' which has the opposite meaning if you're thinking about the meaning of both of these verbs."
81,50,Gretchen,"Can you say, 'I'm coming to go to the farm'?"
81,51,Lauren,"It would be like, 'I'm coming to your house, and then we'll go to the farm together,' so it's not really an auxiliary."
81,52,Gretchen,"The one that I really like is -- so 'have,' which can be an auxiliary or not an auxiliary, is very often pronounced differently in English. It's spelled the same way, but it's pronounced differently in English depending on which one it is."
81,53,Lauren,Huh.
81,54,Gretchen,"Let me try this little quiz for you. If I say, 'I have two pens' versus 'I have to pen up the chickens,' did you notice the difference between how 'have' is pronounced there?"
81,55,Lauren,"'I have two pens' and 'I have to' -- 'I hafta,' 'I hafta pen up the chicks.' I could make that really short."
81,56,Gretchen,"One of them is 'have' pronounced with the V -- 'have to' -- the other one is 'hafta pen' with an F sound, which you could write like 'hafta.' It would be sort of weird, I think, to say, 'I hafta pens,' to mean 'I have two pens.' I don't think I can do that."
81,57,Lauren,'She hasta duck because a chicken is flying over her head' versus 'She has two ducks.'
81,58,Gretchen,That's 'has' which gets pronounced with a Z when it's 'has two ducks.'
81,59,Lauren,"When it's helping, it's no longer the star of the show. We can smooth down the edges of how we pronounce it."
81,60,Gretchen,"And make that S or that V more like the T that's coming after and change the sentence to 'She hasta duck.' I think if you say something like, 'She has to duck,' it sounds very formal. You can do it, but it sounds very, very formal. [Slowly] 'I HAVE to pen up the chickens,' 'She HAS to duck' -- I just have to say it so slowly in order to not make the 'to' into /tə/ and the 'have' into /hæf/ and /hæs/."
81,61,Lauren,"That works for other ones as well. Like, 'I'm gonna come to the farm.'"
81,62,Gretchen,"Right. Like, 'I'm gonna the farm' -- maybe you can say it in some very informal or relaxed varieties."
81,63,Lauren,It's a very informal Australian-sounding pronunciation there.
81,64,Gretchen,"But like, 'I'm gonna milk the cows' or something, like that's just the one that means future. One that I like is, so, you can say, 'I've gone away' -- you're reduced that 'have,' you know, the auxiliary. It's shortened from 'I have gone away.'"
81,65,Lauren,'Have' just reduced to /v/ there.
81,66,Gretchen,But 'I've the milk' -- do you have that?
81,67,Lauren,"Now, you sound British in my head."
81,68,Gretchen,"'I've the milk' and 'I've the eggs.' I think I would have to say, in my Canadian English, 'I've got the milk' or something like that. I'd have to reinforce the meaning there if I wanna shorten it. I really don't think I would say, 'I've to go,' to mean 'I have to go.'"
81,69,Lauren,No. Much harder to shorten a main verb than a helper verb.
81,70,Gretchen,"I can say, 'I gotta go,' 'I have to go,' but it's not quite something I can shorten in that context. Auxiliaries tend to have these sorts of contractions because they're grammar-y things. They're very high frequency. Fun fact about high frequency -- there's a very fun study that finds that words that are unexpected in their context or that are less frequent overall in a language tend to be produced over a longer period of time, like slower with longer duration. The example from this that I really like, which is -- so there's a word, 'cant,' like a 'thieves' cant' or 'the cant of the streets.' You can tell that me saying it with the definition it's not super common. It's like an argot. Like, 'I heard the cant of the streets going through the night.' This tends to be produced much longer and slower and more precisely than 'I can't' as in 'I can't go,' 'I cannot go.'"
81,71,Lauren,"I can't say 'cant' with the same vowel, so it doesn't work for me, but it does make sense because these auxiliaries are really hard-working helpers. They turn up in sentences so often, and they don't contribute that meaning. It makes sense that they would be the thing most likely to reduce."
81,72,Gretchen,"They're squished down because they're being grammatical glue between the big meaning-heavy chunks of words. Once we figure out, okay, this counts as an auxiliary, it's helping the verb in this language, we can then start saying, 'What else do auxiliaries do in a particular language that might be of interest when you start zooming in very narrowly on one language?'"
81,73,Lauren,I know auxiliaries and how we ask questions in English interact in interesting ways.
81,74,Gretchen,"Right. Let's look at some examples and questions. We could have 'Is the horse eating grass?', 'Has the horse eaten grass?', 'Does the horse eat grass?'"
81,75,Lauren,"In all of these, the auxiliary is at the start -- 'Is the horse,' 'Has the horse,' 'Does the horse' -- and 'eat' is further back."
81,76,Gretchen,"'Eat' is further back. When those same verbs are used as main verbs rather than auxiliaries, it gets a bit weirder. So, 'Eats the horse grass?'"
81,77,Lauren,Hmm. Hmm. That doesn't fit with my grammar.
81,78,Gretchen,"This does exist in the history of English. It's still something you can say in other Germanic languages, but it's not something that's for most present-day English speakers. How do you feel about 'Does the horse a dance'?"
81,79,Lauren,"You sound very theatrical, which is usually a way of saying that it is a more archaic form of English."
81,80,Gretchen,What about 'Has the horse an apple?'
81,81,Lauren,"Yep, very similar vibes."
81,82,Gretchen,I feel like that one sounds a bit British to me also. But 'Is the horse an animal?'
81,83,Lauren,"Yeah, that's a perfectly normal sentence to my ears. I sometimes have to double check after hearing a bunch of things that I'm questionable about. Be like, 'Ah, that is a sentence.'"
81,84,Gretchen,"That's why I did it in that order just so you could have that happen to you. Yeah! This is a downstream thing that happens with English auxiliaries if you don't have any auxiliary in the sentence like, 'Eats the horse grass?' You have to put one in, 'Does the horse eat grass?' or 'Can the horse eat grass?' But for some reason, 'is' is an exception. I dunno. 'Is' is a bit weird. You can check out our copulas episode for more. These are why these aren't quite used as a diagnostic for auxiliaries, it's just sort of a thing that happens afterward."
81,85,Lauren,"Once again, there's a reason the Cambridge Grammar of the English Language is the size of a relatively healthy cat."
81,86,Gretchen,A nice big farm cat.
81,87,Lauren,"So far, we've only had examples of sentences with a single auxiliary, but they are so helpful that they're willing to stack up and have more than one to help create even more complex meaning in a sentence."
81,88,Gretchen,"So, if you leave a big barrel of apples on the farm, and there's a bunch of goats around, by the time you get back into the room, you might see that the apples will have been being eaten by the goats for the whole day."
81,89,Lauren,"Oh, no. It's a sad situation but a very exciting use of -- was that four? -- auxiliaries, 'will,' 'have,' 'been,' 'being.'"
81,90,Gretchen,Yep.
81,91,Lauren,And then 'eaten.'
81,92,Gretchen,"Exciting day for the goats. Exciting day for the auxiliaries. Not so exciting for the humans who want to eat the apples. And we still have one main verb, which is 'eaten,' because that's still the action that's happening, and then all of these other auxiliaries are telling us things about how and when and under what circumstances this event happened."
81,93,Lauren,"'Do,' 'have,' and 'be' are doing a lot of heavy lifting in English. We also had a whole episode on modals, which are also like auxiliaries in a lot of ways."
81,94,Gretchen,"Modals are interesting in English because they don't act like full verbs, so you can't just say, 'I can the apple,' or 'I will the apple,' 'I should the apple,' but you can use them in the same auxiliary slot and helping slot as other auxiliaries that are verbs. Sometimes, people talk about auxiliaries as a category that includes verbs that are definitely verb-y, like 'be' and 'have' and 'do,' and other things that are maybe not verb-y, but they're still doing what seems to be the same helping thing as these helping verbs."
81,95,Lauren,"Alongside our really common helpers, there are some occasional helpers. 'Let' is a really nice example. Something like, 'Let's go.'"
81,96,Gretchen,"'Let's go.' It's originally 'Let us go,' which sounds very formal to me, and doesn't quite mean the same thing as 'Let my people go,' 'Let us go,' it just means, 'Shall we go?' or 'Let the group of us go' or 'Let there be light,' 'Let there be peace,' just used as a formal command. 'Let' can be an auxiliary because you have these other main verbs like 'go' and 'be.'"
81,97,Lauren,That's a really nice example of how auxiliaries can fork off from their main verb usage and go on their own little adventures. They're often weird or irregular because they'll keep this grammatical function that's separate from their main meaning function.
81,98,Gretchen,"This grammatical idiosyncrasy of auxiliaries was something that came up a lot when I was learning French. I know you haven't studied French, but my experience with French was that we spent years and years and years learning this one particular thing about French verbs, which is known as the 'passé composé,' which is how to make a certain type of past verb in French, that if you were translating literally, you could translate as something like, 'I have eaten,' 'I have arrived,' but it's used to just mean a general past thing. There's a 'have' word there, but it's used to mean a past thing."
81,99,Lauren,It's nice that it uses 'have' as an auxiliary like English does. Big shout out to 'have.' I feel like we could have a whole 'have' episode.
81,100,Gretchen,"We really could. In this case, it is 'have' most of the time, but sometimes, instead of 'have,' it's 'be.'"
81,101,Lauren,"Okay, this is why it took so long to learn."
81,102,Gretchen,"Yeah. They mean the same thing. There's just, for a word like 'eat,' you use 'have,' but for a word like 'arrive' or 'come' or 'descend,' you use 'be.' It's our old friends 'have' and 'be,' but in this case, it's like some verbs get 'have' and some verbs get 'be.' This is actually something that existed historically in English and still exists a little bit in German where you can kind of say in English, 'I have come' or 'I am arrived.'"
81,103,Lauren,True. They both work.
81,104,Gretchen,"In a way that, with other types of verbs, if you say something like, 'I am laughed.'"
81,105,Lauren,"Okay, that definitely doesn't sit well with my intuitions."
81,106,Gretchen,"No. Or if you say, 'I am eaten,' again, well, that means something very different."
81,107,Lauren,You've got to stay away from those goats. They're very vicious.
81,108,Gretchen,"'Help, help, I'm being eaten alive!' Yeah, but you can say, 'I am arrived,' in a way that's a little bit old fashioned, olde-y time-y in English, but doesn't sound nearly as out there as 'I am laughed' for 'I have laughed.' But in French, this is obligatory. Some verbs are like, 'J'ai mangé,' 'I have eaten,' and some verbs are like, 'Je suis arrivé,' 'I am arrived,' and this is this whole thing that you need to just learn if you're learning French. It's also the case in Italian. There's some stuff in Spanish about which auxiliary verb you need to choose when in these particular grammatical circumstances that is the kind of thing that shows up if you're learning one of these languages."
81,109,Lauren,A good reminder even if two languages use their language's verb for 'have' doesn't mean they always use them in exactly the same places and in exactly the same ways.
81,110,Gretchen,"One of my favourite examples of how a word can become grammaticalised and then almost lose it's original literal meaning comes from Spanish where you have 'haber,' which is spelled with an H, and you can see its roots to Latin 'habeo,' which is 'to have.' This is used for grammatical functions like 'El caballo ha comido,' 'The horse has eaten,' but it's no longer really used in most cases for 'have' as in 'to own' or 'to possess.'"
81,111,Lauren,"So, it's so helpful that it stopped having its own life and now is just helping out."
81,112,Gretchen,"This is a metaphor, you know, don't give up on your dreams, 'haber'! Now, you have 'tener,' which is from Latin and means something like, 'to hold' or 'to keep.' You can say something like, 'El caballo tiene una manzana,' 'The horse has an apple,' as like 'to have' and 'to hold,' which is not the same verb at all that's used for 'has eaten.' But historically, 'have' was used for both, and then they were like, 'Oh, no, let's take this other one to mean the more literal meaning of 'have'.'"
81,113,Lauren,"On the topic of same verb. Latin 'habeo' and English 'have' -- related, not related?"
81,114,Gretchen,"You know, this is the thing that really gets me. They really look like they should be, and they are not."
81,115,Lauren,"Oh, wow, plot twist."
81,116,Gretchen,"Plot twist. They are not. You could look this up. We have looked this up. It's kind of cute. The Wiktionary entry for both 'habeo' and for 'have' are like, 'They're not related, guys. I'm sorry. We promise. Here's all the reasons.'"
81,117,Lauren,Which is why it's always good to double check these things.
81,118,Gretchen,"In fact, we don't think that there was a common Indo-European root for a word meaning 'have' because it's like forked in the descendant languages."
81,119,Lauren,"Ah, got to save it for the 'have' episode."
81,120,Gretchen,"Oh, yes, sorry. One day we will HAVE an episode about 'have.'"
81,121,Lauren,"Acknowledging that auxiliaries can look different in different languages, have slightly different functions, have different downstream effects, let's return to Grambank and have a look at what they have to say about the spread of auxiliaries across the world's languages."
81,122,Gretchen,"Yeah, I wanna find out."
81,123,Lauren,"The nature of the database means that we can look at the types of questions they have asked, and they've asked if auxiliaries are used for a range of different functions across the world's languages."
81,124,Gretchen,"One of those functions is, as we've seen in English, things like, 'is eating,' 'has eaten,' things that have to do with when and how and in relation to what an event is taking place."
81,125,Lauren,"That is the most common use of auxiliary verbs across the world's languages. It's way more than 30% of the world's languages, according to the coding that's been done, have that kind of auxiliary."
81,126,Gretchen,"This is formally known as 'tense, mood, and aspect.' We've done episodes about some of these topics and may do episodes about others of them in the future."
81,127,Lauren,"The next most common use for auxiliary verbs is to use in negation, which is not quite something we have in English."
81,128,Gretchen,"In English, you can make a negation by putting 'not' after an auxiliary, or depending on how you wanna analyse it, you can add 'n't' to the auxiliary. You can say, 'The horse is not eating grass,' which 'not' is not acting like a verb there. I can't say, 'The horse not grass.' Or I can say, 'The horse isn't eating grass,' and the 'n't' is attaching to the 'is,' which is, again, not a separate auxiliary verb that specifically makes it negation."
81,129,Lauren,"That's very different to a language like Irish where the negation changes depending on whether it is happening now or happened in the past. In the present, it is 'ní,' and in the past it is 'níor.'"
81,130,Gretchen,Interesting. That's something that English doesn't do. What percentage of languages do that auxiliary verb for negation?
81,131,Lauren,"It's around 20% of languages in the database have that. The final type of auxiliary use they coded for was, in an English example, 'The grass was eaten by the horse' -- since the horse didn't get its grass before, I wanna make sure it has had it now. That passive usage is found in about 10% of languages. The really nice thing about a database like Grambank is that we can click on the map and see that for these passives, there's this big chain of languages that spread down through the Europe, India, Indo-European area and then down into Southeast Asia. That 10% of languages tend to be focused in that area. There're large parts of the Pacific and Africa and North and South America where there aren't as many languages that do this, so we see some kind of common themes among specific languages of certain families or in certain areas that tend to more likely do this. That's one of the really useful benefits of a big database of features like this."
81,132,Gretchen,And one that's based on a map where you have all of these languages as points on a map.
81,133,Lauren,"Yeah, totally."
81,134,Gretchen,"That's really neat. Seeing languages that are related to each other or just languages that had contact with each other over thousands and thousands of years of history and many people have been bilingual and borrowed things from one language to the next, and you can see these areal groupings of different languages. Auxiliaries are very neat, but clearly, they're not a thing that all languages necessarily feel the need to use. If a language isn't using an auxiliary, what are some of the things that they could be doing instead?"
81,135,Lauren,"Grambank tends to code things just on a yes or no basis, so if it doesn't have it, it's just coded as a no, but we know there're some other strategies if you're not using an auxiliary that you can use to get the same kind of function."
81,136,Gretchen,"One obvious idea would be to use a suffix or a prefix. If you wanted to say something like, 'The grass was eaten,' you could add some sort of ending or some sort of prefix on to 'eat' that would make it passive instead of having the 'was eaten' part make it passive. This is a strategy that lots of languages do."
81,137,Lauren,You might have a prefix for negation instead of some strategy that uses an auxiliary.
81,138,Gretchen,"You can also use a different type of word. Instead of something being specifically you're recruiting a helping verb that is verb-y to do your meaning, you could also have a 'particle,' which is a glorious linguistic catch-all term for 'I dunno. It's a word doing something.' It's not obviously a verb. It's not obviously a noun. It's just a word that's there and doesn't really change its form -- like 'not,' which I think is a negative particle. Something like 'not' is a way of expressing negation rather than changing the end of the word, the beginning of the word, you can have 'Let's just stick in another word.' I don't think anybody thinks 'not' is a verb in English."
81,139,Lauren,"I don't know, but different linguists use different criteria for defining what is a verb and what is a particle, so if they have an argument to make for it, then it'd be interesting to hear."
81,140,Gretchen,"I think in English our standard tests for verb-hood 'The horse not the apple' doesn't seem like it's acting like a verb there. You could use other words that aren't necessarily verbs to express negation or passives or any of these complicated tense-y, time-y, timeline-y things."
81,141,Lauren,"You could say something like, 'The horse habitually eats grass.' We have to use 'habitually' there or 'regularly,' and it makes you realise just how elegant that AAVE construction is using habitual 'be' for 'The horse be eating grass.'"
81,142,Gretchen,Or 'I eat already' compared to 'I have eaten.' The 'already' or the 'usually' or the 'habitually' -- adverb-y things -- can also sometimes express some of these meanings as well. We've given a lot of love to 'have' as a very common copula.
81,143,Lauren,We have.
81,144,Gretchen,We have. But also 'be' is a very common copula in a bunch of languages.
81,145,Lauren,We are gonna give it some love.
81,146,Gretchen,Basque uses 'be' as a copula.
81,147,Lauren,"Ooo, our isolate language of Europe."
81,148,Gretchen,"Yes. I don't know enough about the history of Basque to know whether this is related to contact with a bunch of other Indo-European languages in the Spain/France region where Basque is spoken, or whether this is something that is passed down from historical Proto-Basque, but it does use 'be' as an auxiliary."
81,149,Lauren,"Okay. So, still in the European neighbourhood. But we don't need to stay in that neighbourhood. Palestinian Arabic is another language that has been analysed as using 'be' as an auxiliary."
81,150,Gretchen,"Very nice. We have an example where something like, 'She wrote,' is done without an auxiliary, and then something like 'She used to write' uses 'be' to express that 'used to' meaning. 'Used to' is another interesting example of an auxiliary in English, actually, now that we're thinking about it."
81,151,Lauren,While we're collecting them.
81,152,Gretchen,Compared to 'used two pencils to write.'
81,153,Lauren,"Hmm, yes."
81,154,Gretchen,"Also, Kinande, which is a Bantu language, uses 'be' as an auxiliary."
81,155,Lauren,Excellent.
81,156,Gretchen,"I have a rather violent example here, which is 'We hit (recently, not today),' and 'We are hitting,' are both forms of the verb that change based on a prefix. Then 'We were (recently, not today) hitting' is a form of the verb that uses 'be' to express part of that meaning."
81,157,Lauren,"So, all using the same 'be' verb but in slightly different ways and to achieve different grammatical ends."
81,158,Gretchen,"Exactly. And showcasing some of the ranges of examples of different types of meanings, whether that's recent past or 'used to' or other types of meanings that can be expressed with an auxiliary just depending on what your language is in to."
81,159,Lauren,"While they're not the only verbs that can become auxiliaries, 'have' and 'be' deserve special shoutouts for being the work horses of auxiliaries across many languages."
81,160,Gretchen,"We could think of auxiliary verbs as if you are just a person with a shovel, with a rake, trying to plant some seeds, you're gonna have a bit more difficulty than if you have a plough or you have a horse that can draw it and help you out with your ploughing, so you have the horse helping you out."
81,161,Lauren,I think maybe we should think of it as an aux-driven plough instead of an ox-driven plough.
81,162,Gretchen,"Oh, no, these words sound exactly the same for me. 'Ox' as in 'oxen,' the animal, and 'aux' as in 'auxiliary' sound exactly the same for me."
81,163,Lauren,This is disappointing where 'ox' and 'aux' are another thing where I don't have a merger.
81,164,Gretchen,I think actually English might be the only language that has the 'ox/aux' merger.
81,165,Lauren,Okay.
81,166,Gretchen,"Because 'auxiliary' comes from French, and so French has 'auxiliaire' to mean the grammatical thing, but then the animal, like a male cow, is just a 'bœuf,' like a 'beef.' Whereas German has 'Ochs,' as in the cow, but for the grammatical thing it has 'Hilfsverb,' which just means 'help verb.'"
81,167,Lauren,"Oh, a much more transparent root than English borrowing French auxiliary."
81,168,Gretchen,"But it does let us make this spectacular joke, which is that you can have an aux-driven verb. There are a few people, including friend of the podcast Kirby Conrod, who sometimes jocularly pluralise 'aux,' as in 'auxiliary,' as 'auxen,' like the cow."
81,169,Lauren,"Oh, I am definitely gonna start calling them 'auxen' from now on. It's a nice souvenir from our trip to the farm. [Music]"

82,7,Gretchen,"Lauren, can I tell you a story?"
82,8,Lauren,"Yes, please."
82,9,Gretchen,This story is about the north wind and the sun.
82,10,Lauren,Hm.
82,11,Gretchen,"'The North Wind and the Sun were disputing which was the stronger when a traveller came along wrapped in a warm cloak. They agreed that the one who first succeeded in making the traveller take his cloak off should be considered stronger than the other. Then the North Wind blew as hard as he could, but the more he blew, the more closely did the traveller fold his cloak around him. At last, the North Wind gave up the attempt. Then the Sun shone out warmly, and immediately the traveller took off his cloak. And so, the North Wind was obliged to confess that the Sun was the stronger of the two. The end.'"
82,12,Lauren,"A classic Aesop's Fable. In fact, literally one of Aesop's Fables there. But I know it specifically as the example text that people record to illustrate the sounds in a given language."
82,13,Gretchen,Yeah. I think I actually had an illustrated children's picture book of this when I was a child.
82,14,Lauren,Because of your interest in phonetics across the world's languages?
82,15,Gretchen,"Yes, that is definitely why my parents bought me this as a five-year-old. No, I think they just liked the moral, 'You can do more with persuasion than you can with force,' which was the last sentence in the illustrated Aesop's Fable version that I had as a child. But imagine my surprise when, many years later in linguistic school, I encountered this story as a classic example text."
82,16,Lauren,"This text gets translated into many different languages, and it's read as the example passage of what it sounds like to tell a story in a language as part of a series called 'Illustrations of the International Phonetic Alphabet.'"
82,17,Gretchen,"The Journal of the International Phonetic Association -- this is the one, I think, where all of the articles used to actually be written in phonetic transcription rather than in standard orthography, which is fantastic."
82,18,Lauren,"Now they've moved to standard orthography, but what is also fantastic is all these articles that illustrate the way that different languages sound. You can download and listen to the recordings that are made as part of those journal articles, including recordings of a narrative passage, which is usually 'The North Wind and the Sun.'"
82,19,Gretchen,"I guess it's a relatively classic passage. It does involve personifying the elements, but many cultures do allow you to personify the elements. I think some other passages that sometimes get used as comparative linguistic passages are particular stories from the Bible because the Bible has been translated in a bunch of languages. But this is not great because people often use a stylised, formal style of language for Biblical texts that really doesn't reflect how people talk in everyday life. Much as Aesop's Fables are a bit culturally specific, the Bible is also very culturally specific."
82,20,Lauren,"I do also appreciate when they were recording examples of New Zealand English, they did translate it to 'The Southerly Wind and the Sun' to make it more geographically appropriate."
82,21,Gretchen,"Oh, excellent. Yes. They do change out the words sometimes whether you have 'the Sun shone' or 'the Sun shined,' sort of depends on variation. Sometimes, they have this exact text being read aloud, and sometimes they let people retell it in their own words. Of course, if you're translating it into lots of different languages, you can localise that translation however you want."
82,22,Lauren,You told me a story. I think it's only fair that I tell you a story.
82,23,Gretchen,"Oh, yes, please."
82,24,Lauren,Are you ready?
82,25,Gretchen,Yes.
82,26,Lauren,"Okay. 'Please call Stella. Ask her to bring these things with her from the stone: six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob. We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids. She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.'"
82,27,Gretchen,This is a bit of a different style of story to me than the Aesop's Fable style. 'Small plastic snake' -- I don't think this one was found in Ancient Greece.
82,28,Lauren,And perhaps less of a direct moral to this one.
82,29,Gretchen,"It also is a little bit directive, like, 'Oh, it's my job to call Stella. All right.' This story comes from the speech accent archive, which is a website that has many hundreds, probably a thousand -- I wasn't able to get a precise count of speech samples -- of people speaking English who have both a variety of accents of English and also who's first language is something else, and a variety of non-native accents in English, all reading this same English paragraph, so that if you want to know what Ugandan English sounds like, you can listen to some audio clips of some people from Uganda reading this passage, and you can be like, 'All right, here's what it sounds like.'"
82,30,Lauren,"Everyone's reading the same thing. We have a nice clear benchmark. It has lots of different sounds, lots of S-y sounds I noticed as I was trying to read this out to you."
82,31,Gretchen,"It's got 'slabs' and 'snake' and 'snack' and 'store' and 'spoons,' so a lot of these S-plus-consonant-clusters and several -- 'these things into three' -- /ð/ /θ/ /θ/. You get a bunch of different sounds and sound sequences. The note on the speech accent archive website says, 'This paragraph contains practically all the sounds of English,' which I think is because, depending on your variety of English, exactly which sounds are in it and not can vary, but they've made an effort to get at least most of them."
82,32,Lauren,The fact that they've made this effort to get all the sounds means that perhaps the meaning of the story becomes less important I think it's fair to say.
82,33,Gretchen,It's a little silly.
82,34,Lauren,"It gets a little bit silly trying to make something that sounds sufficiently coherent, but you're really focused on the individual sounds."
82,35,Gretchen,"'Six spoons of fresh snow peas' -- I dunno that I really measure snow peas in spoons, but people can read somewhat nonsensical text, and that's also okay. This is very English-centric. There's not an effort to translate this story into other languages because it's focused around trying to get a specific range of sounds in English."
82,36,Lauren,I just know this as 'The Stella Passage.'
82,37,Gretchen,"I would call this one 'Please Call Stella.' I think that's just what I would refer to it as. There's also some passages -- so there's a longer passage that's about rainbows, known as 'The Rainbow Passage.'"
82,38,Lauren,'The Rainbow Passage.'
82,39,Gretchen,"Which I will not read in full because it's a whole page, but it begins, 'When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colours.'"
82,40,Lauren,Aww.
82,41,Gretchen,"Yeah, it's kinda sweet. 'The Rainbow Passage' and another passage called 'The Grandfather Passage' are familiar to me from linguistics and came up recently because a friend mentioned that they're used in people who are doing gender voice training. If you're trans, you want your voice to be perceived as a different gender, something that some people do is adjust the way they produce certain vowels and consonants so that they sound more characteristic of a particular gender. People often practice on particular reading passages, which are part of speech training. You can record yourself and keep an idea of what your progress is over time. This 'Rainbow Passage' and 'The Grandfather Passage,' which is another one that's about your grandfather -- this very old school guy who wears a frock coat."
82,42,Lauren,He's eccentric but sound of mind if I recall.
82,43,Gretchen,Yes. I think this is a very old school grandfather. I don't think anyone's current grandfather wears a frock coat these days unless they're a historical reenactor or something. But these are some passages that sometimes get used in speech training. There's a really interesting interview on the Gender Reveal podcast with Renée Yoxon who does trans voice coaching if anyone wants to know more about how that goes.
82,44,Lauren,"It's really fascinating the lives that these example texts live as they continue on in the world. Another set of example sentences are the Harvard Sentences, which are around 700+ sentences that are used mostly used in training speech-text synthesis programmes or testing telecommunications systems."
82,45,Gretchen,"The Harvard Sentences, there's 720 of them -- about 10-word sentences -- so there's tons of them. They're also designed for their phonetic value. They're designed to contain English sounds in a range of different contexts. For example, in English, we say the /k/ sound in 'keen' slightly differently from how we say the /k/ sound in 'cool' or in 'stick.' You need to have words that contain it at the beginning of the word, at the end of the word, before several different vowels, so that when you're trying to put it into words, it sounds a little bit less robotic."
82,46,Lauren,"This is why they also get their other name, which is the 'Harvard Balanced Sentences,' because they have a balance of the most commonly occurring English speech sounds in a balanced range of contexts."
82,47,Gretchen,"Right. We thought maybe this would make them a little bit extra soothing. Also, there's 700 of these, so we can't read them all to you in this episode because that would get a little bit boring and tedious, and you might go to sleep."
82,48,Lauren,"In fact, that is a perfect application for recording all 720 of them as a soothing ASMR experience."
82,49,Gretchen,"Wait, can we call this 'Lingthusiasmr'?"
82,50,Lauren,I think we can.
82,51,Gretchen,"'ASMR,' if you haven't encountered it, is the 'autonomous sensory meridian response,' which is the relaxed chills feeling that people feel down their spine when you listen to certain kinds of slow and relaxing sounds. I'm not entirely sure that our episode will induce ASMR. We'll have to test that empirically. But I do think it sounds very soothing and will probably help you sleep. Please let us know if it works if you think this is fun."
82,52,Lauren,"I have to say, from the experience of recording them, they are such boring nonsense that they become kind of surreal."
82,53,Gretchen,"I really felt like I was zoning out as I was reading them. We read them 10 at a time and took turns, and by the end of the 10 list, I would be sort of like, 'Oh, I'm very slow. My heartrate has gone down. I'm relaxed.' I think it's important to recognise that when people are reading example sentences, that is work, and it takes concentrate to try to read exactly the words on the page in a consistent tone of voice and not stumble over words. We definitely had to re-record some bits and edit them back together to make them sound smooth."
82,54,Lauren,"Having recorded other people for phonetics experiments, this just once again reminded me of how much respect I have for people and their patience and their willingness to participate in recording sentences like this for analysis."
82,55,Gretchen,"Thank you to our patrons for letting us do not only the podcast in general but also occasionally fun, weird experiments like this. Let us know if it actually helps you sleep or if this is fun or we should never do it again. All of these are options. Did you notice anything else about the content of the sentences as you were reading all 700, Lauren?"
82,56,Lauren,"I did. We -- I have to say -- did skip a few sentences because they did not produce the chill, relaxed vibes we were going for, especially the ones about forest fires and cutting off people's heads."
82,57,Gretchen,"Yeah, some of the sentences were a bit violent. We thought, you know, if you're trying to fall asleep, and then you hear 'The prince ordered the person's head to be cut off,' you're like, 'I don't know if I wanna hear that.' Even though it's a fairytale setting, it's still not very cheerful. We didn't record all 720. We thought we would sacrifice balanced, scientific accuracy for being-able-to-fall-asleep-itude. I noticed that sentences that we kept, which was most of them, had this agricultural vibe."
82,58,Lauren,Which is pretty funny given that these are from the 1950s and '60s.
82,59,Gretchen,"They're from the '60s. They had cars in the 1960s, and yet, there's one car in all of these sentences, and there's a lot of horses."
82,60,Lauren,"There are a lot of horses, indeed."
82,61,Gretchen,"And wagons and carts. There's one bus and one train and one car, and there's all these horses and wagons. It's just sort of pastoral."
82,62,Lauren,"I also appreciate the person who wrote them who put all of the examples with 'fudge' in there, but that might be just because I was hungry while we were recording."
82,63,Gretchen,"Delicious. We did consider briefly trying to come up with replacement sentences that would still be phonetically balanced, but it's a lot of work to come up with sentences that contain certain sounds in particular combinations and also make enough sense that you can read them even if some of them are a little bit silly."
82,64,Lauren,"In fact, a lot of phonetic elicitation is done by just getting people to say a particular single word, maybe inside a sentence, so that you get it in a more natural environment rather than just listing individual words where you get this [list intonation voice] LIST intoNATION as people READ through the LIST."
82,65,Gretchen,"If you want people to say, for example, a bunch of colours, you shouldn't just have them say, 'Red, orange, yellow, green.' You could instead do, 'I saw the red thing,' 'I saw the blue thing,' 'I saw the green thing.' And then you can cut out the 'red' and 'blue' and 'green' from the middle of 'I saw the whatever thing,' so that it's in the middle like that. Is that right?"
82,66,Lauren,"Yeah. Sometimes, in phonetics we're so interested in just the sounds themselves. We don't even care if the words make sense let alone the sentences. People will come up with nonsense words that they can record to get particular sounds."
82,67,Gretchen,"I have a fun story about that from when I was an undergrad where we had to come up with a bunch of nonsense words for stimuli, only one of the words that we came up with -- I forget what it was. I think all of our words were like consonant-vowel-consonant, so it was something that was like a slang swear word or a word related to some sort of risqué topic, and the prof was like, 'Oh, we can use this word, right?' And all the students sort of look at each other and start giggling. We're like, 'Who's gonna tell him?'"
82,68,Lauren,"Okay, excellent public service announcement. If you are creating nonsense words for a phonetic study, maybe run them by a couple of your students first just to check."
82,69,Gretchen,Run them by somebody who has a bit of a dirty mind. Look them up on Urban Dictionary. Ask a few people if you're not working on a language where you have something like Urban Dictionary just to make sure that they're not actually a word that's gonna have your participants giggling.
82,70,Lauren,"So far, we've been discussing sentences and texts for studying the sounds of language, but there're also some commonly reoccurring texts that people use when they're looking at sentences or even larger units of language to study."
82,71,Gretchen,"One of the these is what I know as 'The Frog Story,' which is a wordless picture book that has a little boy and a frog in a jar, and the frog escapes, and the boy and the dog have to go after the frog, and then they find the frog on a log. It's very charming, and there's no words there, so people just have to look through it once, and then you go through it again and retell that story based on the pictures."
82,72,Lauren,"I have a copy of this book, and there are five or six in the series. They're super charming. But every time I pull it off my shelf, I get mildly surprised that it's not called 'Frog Story,' it's called, 'Frog, Where Are You?'"
82,73,Gretchen,"Oh, I always forget this because in linguistics people just call it 'The Frog Story.'"
82,74,Lauren,It's by Mercer Mayer from 1969.
82,75,Gretchen,"You can tell when you're in someone's talk, and they're saying, 'The boy looked for the frog behind the tree,' and you're like, 'I know how you elicited this sentence.' But the nice thing about it not having written words is that you can use it with children, you can use it with speakers of a bunch of different languages. It does have some relatively culturally-specific concepts like, you know, do you recognise pictures as telling a story in a particular order? Is this cartoon drawing of a frog legible to you as a frog? But it is at least more culturally abstract than just having people directly translate a particular type of story word-by-word."
82,76,Lauren,"I appreciate it because it leads to some really charming example sentences when people are discussing, say, how the structure of sentences works or maybe how people put together a story in a particular culture."
82,77,Gretchen,"It's got that sort of, you know, the frog runs away, and then the frog is found, and it follows that narrative arc of losing something and the finding it, which is I think relatively straightforward to tell in a bunch of languages."
82,78,Lauren,"A book is very easy to take with you regardless of where you're doing your analysis. You don't need to have electricity or anything compared to another really common thing that's used to get people to tell stories, which is a short video called 'The Pear Story.'"
82,79,Gretchen,"'The Pear Story' is so charming. It's this six-minute film that was produced at the University of California at Berkeley in 1975. It has no language in it. There's sound effects, but no one says anything. You have this story that they showed to a bunch of speakers of languages who are asked to then retell the story from the images."
82,80,Lauren,You can tell it's from 1975 because people have amazing pants and hair from the era.
82,81,Gretchen,"Oh, yeah, there is for sure some flair in those pants. The story is, roughly, having just watched it -- this is on YouTube if you want to watch it for yourself -- but there's a man who's a farmer, I guess, who's got a kerchief around his neck. He's climbing a ladder up a tree, picking some pears, and putting them in a basket. He picks a whole basket full of pears and sets it down with the other basket of pears below the tree, and he goes back up the ladder. Then some guy comes by with a goat for no apparent reason."
82,82,Lauren,[Laughs] Yes.
82,83,Gretchen,As you do. Then a little boy comes by on a bicycle and picks up one of the big baskets of pears and puts it on the front handlebars of the bike and drives off with it. Bum bum bum.
82,84,Lauren,Right.
82,85,Gretchen,Then the kid on the bike runs into another group of three kids. One of them has a little paddle thing that has an elastic thing with a ball on the end.
82,86,Lauren,And they're bouncing the paddleball thingamajig.
82,87,Gretchen,"Yeah, that thing. And the kid on the bike runs into a rock and falls off the bike, and the pears fall all over the place. The kid's okay. But the other kids help him put the pears back in the basket. And he goes off on the bike again except he's -- oh, he's lost his hat, and the kids give his hat back as well. Then Bike Kid goes off into the sunset, and the other kids go off, and they've secretly each got a pear in their pocket that they took as thank you for helping with the basket. Then the farmer comes back down the tree and is like, 'Oh my god! Where did my pears go? Where did the whole basket go?' And the three kids who were helping were like, 'Oh, I dunno.' That's the end of the story."
82,88,Lauren,"One thing your retelling reminds me of is that this is actually really nicely shot. It's clear that it's in California, right. It feels like they actually got some film people to shoot a really, really nice film."
82,89,Gretchen,Right. And I think they got actors to be the characters because the characters look like they're the wrong age for grad students.
82,90,Lauren,Which is often what happens when people are shooting an elicitation video on no budget.
82,91,Gretchen,"Right. Like, it's not just you and five of your friends from grad school. Because the kids are too young to be grad students, and the farmer looks middle aged. There are some middle-aged grad students, but it's less like, 'Okay, you got a bunch of people in their 20s to do this -- 20s and 30s to do this.' It's beautifully shot. It's got nice lighting and all of this stuff. They got a goat. I dunno where they got the goat."
82,92,Lauren,"Well, the goat reminds me, but when they put this pear story together -- and it is literally called 'The Pear Story,' unlike 'Frog Story' which has a secret other name -- when they put this together, they deliberately had these things they were trying to see whether they would come up or how people would do them in narratives across language. The goat being there that has nothing to do with the story is whether people pay attention to background information. The fact that we start off -- you said 'a farmer' at the start, and when he comes back, he's 'the farmer.' You're reidentifying the same person. Even the paddleball little bouncy thingy thing was deliberately something that people might not have a name for immediately so that they would have to do essentially what we did and negotiate what it's called."
82,93,Gretchen,"So, you learn the language's word for 'thingamajig' or 'toy,' or I don't -- the way you describe something you don't necessarily have words for because languages do have ways of describing things they don't have words for. If you put something that the word for which is very obscure, I don't know what the word is for this in English, then people have to figure out how to describe it. I guess, I dunno, probably all languages don't have words for pears, but presumably, you might say 'fruit' or something like that if you didn't have a specific word for 'pear.'"
82,94,Lauren,"Not getting too bogged down in the detail, but what makes it really powerful is that there was a book about analysing Pear storytellings in the 1980s. People have continued to use 'The Pear Story.' So, it starts to become something where you can benchmark experience in storytelling across languages. For example, there's this really great paper about Meithei, which is a language in the northeast of India where Shobhana Chelliah was working with this language and noticed that when people tell stories there's not an expectation that you necessarily say who is doing what, but it should be apparent from context. You might not necessarily say 'the boys' or the 'the farmer' every time they do something. Instead, you focus more on the actions, and it's through the conversation that people keep track of who's doing what. It was really hard to know exactly who was doing what in a story that people were telling about what happened in their own village or in their own family last week. She recorded a bunch of people telling 'The Pear Story' and could literally count the number of times they said, 'the farmer,' 'the boy.'"
82,95,Gretchen,"And because the researcher already knows what happens in the video, it gives you this shared common ground. And generally, the task is something like you have people watch a video, and then you have them retell the story of the video to someone who hasn't seen it, say, 'Tell it to this person who hasn't seen it,' or 'Tell it to me,' and you say that you haven't seen it. It's a relatively natural-ish context. People often know a story that they're telling to someone else who hasn't experienced it. I mean, it's as natural as you can get for something that's relatively constrained so that everyone's doing the same task, whereas 'The Frog Story,' you have people flip through page by page and narrate what's happening on each page, 'The Pear Story' tends to be you have people watch the whole thing and then retell the story afterward."
82,96,Lauren,"Because it's being recorded in a bunch of other languages, they could literally go back and say, 'Yeah, in Meithei, there really are fewer times that people say who is doing what compared to the existing tellings that we have in languages like English.' So, a really neat example of how this kind of task can be really helpful in understanding how different languages do storytelling differently."
82,97,Gretchen,Do you have any examples of this from the gesture literature?
82,98,Lauren,"I do, indeed. Because you can immediately tell when something is situated in the gesture literature because they make people watch a particular Sylvester and Tweety Bird cartoon from Warner Brothers."
82,99,Gretchen,Okay. They didn't get a bunch of University of California grad students to act it out in the field?
82,100,Lauren,"They did not. But anytime you see an example of a cat climbing or a cat swinging or something about a bird, you almost always know that it's taken from a particular cartoon called 'Canary Row,' which is where Tweety Bird is in one apartment building, and across the road, Sylvester's in the other. Sylvester in this eternal quest to get to Tweety Bird -- there's lots of different actions that Sylvester performs. When you get people to retell it, you get really great gestures out of them. I feel when I read a gesture studies paper, and they've played this -- and it doesn't require language, so you can play it to speakers of English or Turkish or Japanese. Every time I see example sentences from 'Canary Row,' I just feel this, like, 'Aww.'"
82,101,Gretchen,'Aww.'
82,102,Lauren,'It's a gesture paper.'
82,103,Gretchen,"It's cute how stories like this can also become part of linguistics as a cultural area where you feel part of gesture studies as a culture by seeing the Sylvester and Tweety one. 'The Pear Story' was part of my grad school tradition when we did a field methods class. It was like, 'Okay, we're gonna learn how to use 'The Pear Story' when it comes to elicitation.' I took other field methods classes where we didn't use 'The Pear Story,' but in this one, it was part of that enculturation. There's probably other examples of texts that are canonical sets of examples in other lineages of linguistics, we're just showing the ones that are available to us in our context."
82,104,Lauren,"Yeah, I know Frog Story is really popular with people doing language documentation because you can just pack a book in your field kit. It's also popular with child language acquisition researchers because parent-child interaction around books is a relatively common thing, especially in Western cultures. It becomes fun the more you work in these areas, and you begin to recognise recurring texts from the examples that people produce in talks or in papers."
82,105,Gretchen,"I think we could really, if we ever wanted to get into publishing a line of children's books -- you know, produce 'The North Wind and the Sun,' 'Please Call Stella' -- you could illustrate that like a children's book. I guess Mercer Mayer already has the copywrite on 'The Frog Story,' but you know, maybe he'd like to produce a special edition just for linguists. You could have a whole line of linguistically relevant children's books."
82,106,Lauren,Exceedingly charming.
82,107,Gretchen,Somebody commission this from us.
82,108,Lauren,Getting people to produce sentences either by reading passages or reading stories or retelling stories is one way to come up with example sentences to illustrate a feature of a language. But there is also a long tradition in linguistics of people coming up with example sentences.
82,109,Gretchen,"Right. Because we all know at least one language in some capacity. Sometimes, you study a language by going and finding a speaker or a signer and saying, 'Hey, can you say this? Or can you say some stuff for me?', and I'll record it, and I'll analyse it, but you, yourself, are also someone who knows a language. So, if I wanna say, ''Please call Stella' is a sentence in English,' I don't necessarily need to go and ask 20 of my friends to be like, 'Yeah, I think that any English speaker would just understand me.' There's the armchair-inside-your-office method of saying, 'Yeah, if I think that 'The dog chased the cat' is a grammatical sentence in English.' I don't necessarily need to go ask 100 people just to confirm this relatively basic thing. Then there's the slightly expanded version which is, 'Okay, I think this is a sentence in English,' and then you do a talk about your paper for a research group or at a conference, and there's a dozen people in the room, or there's 20 or 40 people in the room, and if they all speak English or French or whatever the language of your paper is in, and everyone in the room agrees, 'Yeah, we think the sentences that you've presented in this language are valid,' then it's like you've surveyed those 20 or 40 people. I think sometimes that linguists should give themselves more credit for this. There are really interesting papers trying to replicate these grammaticality judgements and like, what if we tested some of these sentences on 100 and see -- like, sometimes there are regional differences, or people will have individual idiolect differences about which things they find work for them as a sentence or not. It is worth testing some of these. But often, if you have actually tested them on everybody in your department, or everybody who was attending this particular conference talk, it is actually running them by 20 people or 40 people, which is a pretty good statistical number."
82,110,Lauren,There is also a tradition of creating sentences and getting people to check them when it's not a language you have strong intuitions about yourself. One of my favourite things to do while doing this is to create sentences that I know people won't find grammatical just to double check I haven't missed anything about how things might work in the language.
82,111,Gretchen,And to reinforce that you are not expecting them to just say yes for every single sentence.
82,112,Lauren,"Yeah. Running past, 'Ah, can we say, 'Please Stella call'?'"
82,113,Gretchen,"People are like, 'No, what? No.'"
82,114,Lauren,"I do feel sorry for people who I do this to who are just like, 'Has she learnt nothing from us?'"
82,115,Gretchen,"It's also fun when people will have -- you know, because sometimes you just need some names. Like, who's Stella? Why is she in these sentences? You need some names of people to be in your sentences. Sometimes, people will come up with cute, recurring characters from if they're watching a particular TV show, they'll start naming characters in their class about things. David Adger's book, Language Unlimited, he uses his cat and his husband as the example people in these sentences, which is very charming."
82,116,Lauren,How did you come up with examples for Because Internet?
82,117,Gretchen,"I particularly wanted in Because Internet to not have the people in the example sentences seem gendered. Sometimes, you see a lot of Johns and Marys in example sentences, and I just think that's boring."
82,118,Lauren,There's a lot of Stellas buying snacks for her brother Bob.
82,119,Gretchen,"Those are very generic Anglo names. And I was like, 'Well, this is kind of dull.' And also, that in Because Internet, the book is trying to be fun and interesting for people, I thought if I make silly example person names, that will make it more fun to read, and that's one of my goals. I deliberately used the 'Boaty McBoatface' method of coming up with example sentences."
82,120,Lauren,Okay. What does that look like?
82,121,Gretchen,Can I read you an example?
82,122,Lauren,Sure.
82,123,Gretchen,"'You're more likely to start using a new word from Friendy McNetwork, who shares a lot of mutual friends with you, and less likely to pick it up from Rando McRandomface, who doesn't share any of your friends even if you and Rando follow each other just like you and Friendy do.'"
82,124,Lauren,"I like that if you had just used 'Stella' and 'Bob,' by the time we got to 'You and Bob would use more words in common' because I can't remember if Bob is the one you're friends with."
82,125,Gretchen,"Exactly. Naming them after the trait that they're supposed to have -- like 'Friendy McNetwork' is the one you have a lot of shared friends with and 'Rando' is the one that you know them, but you don't have any friends in common. Then when you get to the second half of the sentence, 'even if you and Rando follow each other just like you and Friendy do,' it's really easy to track which one is which in the earlier part of the sentence. There's practical considerations, but also, I found it kind of fun, you know, they're gender neutral. They're clearly not anyone's real name. They're sort of fanciful and a bit fun."
82,126,Lauren,"I always like a bit of whimsy when it comes to examples. In our recent auxiliaries episode, we really leaned heavily into the farm theme that we created for that episode."
82,127,Gretchen,"Yes, we did. Because it's sometimes when you know that you're gonna need a whole bunch of examples in a text or an episode, it's fun to theme them so that you're not just reaching for the same -- like I think we used examples like 'I like cake' a lot, or like, 'I eat ice cream.' A lot of our examples are about ice cream and cake, which is fun. I mean, we do like both of these things, but sometimes, for an episode that's gonna be really example heavy, using horses and farmyard animals and stuff is a fun way to make it a little more distinct from other episodes."
82,128,Lauren,"This is where you can really tell the difference between a piece of linguistic work where the examples have come from someone's intuitions to illustrate something compared to when the focus has been on finding examples from the stories and recordings and conversations that people have that are much more spontaneous where they might not always be so smooth and perfect. You might be missing the person who's doing the thing in 'The Pear Story,' but there's a really great example of how it has some kind of particular emphasis or spin. Whether you use created examples or found examples can really change the flavour of how you're doing your analysis."
82,129,Gretchen,"Right. I think ideally, one wants to have a balance of both. It can be useful to have things that are easier to compare to other languages because they're more similar, and then also, you really wanna consider the language in and of itself and not be always forcing it in the mould of 'Well, let's be able to compare it.' Also, we wanna see 'What are people doing in this language when you don't have a preconceived idea of what you're doing with them?' It's a balance between those two types of things. One's easier to work with, and one is potentially gonna give you insights that you weren't looking for."
82,130,Lauren,"On top of juggling that, it's also worth paying attention to whether you're beginning to get a bit of a bias in the examples in terms of the vibes as well as what's happening linguistically."
82,131,Gretchen,"A lot of these examples are coming from the '60s and '70s, and they present this very bucolic view of what types of things people talk about. I noticed that there's a lot of male entities in a lot of these sentences, except for our friend Stella, to whom we call."
82,132,Lauren,But Stella's doing a lot of work.
82,133,Gretchen,"She's getting all those things for her brother Bob. But 'The Pear Story' has a farmer with a moustache in a tree, and it has a boy on a bicycle, and I think it has a girl go by on a bike as well, but there's a lot more male entities in several of these examples. Same with 'The Frog Story,' which has a little boy and a frog. It might be that gender signifiers in different cultures are different, and that some people read these stories and read the characters gender-neutrally or read them as female. And I don't wanna say that this isn't a possibility, but from the English perspective of people who were composing these, they're gender biased in a particular way."
82,134,Lauren,"For sure. It's not just vibes. There's a great paper from 1997 by Macaulay and Brice that looks at just how gender stereotyping happens, especially in syntax examples for sentence structure. They do see not only there're more examples where they use men or male names, but if they do have women or female names in the examples, they are usually being acted upon or required to chase down snacks for their brothers."
82,135,Gretchen,"I think that one may be particular to the 'Please Call Stella' example. But you're more likely to have a sentence that's like, 'John saw Mary,' than you are 'Mary saw John,' even though both of those are equally valid. For a while -- this was wild to me when I learned it -- for a while, there were explicit style guide policies that said by default you should prefer male names in the subject position and female names in the object position. I'm like, whoa, that was a policy at some point! Okay."
82,136,Lauren,Was it? It's not even unconscious bias. It's deliberate choice.
82,137,Gretchen,"That was a deliberate choice back in the day. That was a style guide thing. Undoing that, now that it's become this unconscious thing that people are still doing, is more challenging. The fun thing, I guess, about how a lot of example sentences in old school syntax papers use 'John' and 'Mary' and 'Bill' is that there is someone who took a bunch of example sentences from papers since the refer to the same people and stitched them together into a single narrative about the adventures of John and Mary and Bill."
82,138,Lauren,Another in our children's picture book series.
82,139,Gretchen,"Oh my gosh, this is like the See Spot Run of linguistics!"
82,140,Lauren,"It's not only worth paying attention to who is doing what but the 'what' that is happening. There's this really unfortunate fact that when you want to have a sentence where someone is doing something to someone else, the best -- in terms of showing stuff linguistically -- thing to have them do is hitting."
82,141,Gretchen,Oh no.
82,142,Lauren,"Because it's very clear that there's one animate, active person doing something to another entity, and it's very distinct and clear and active."
82,143,Gretchen,"It's something where you can have an animate person acting on another animate person. For example, if you cut the bread or something, you have an animate acting on an inanimate like 'bread' or 'cheese' or something, so it's more clear who's doing what to who because the cheese isn't gonna come around and try to cut me -- unless I have a very sharp cheddar. Dun dun dun."
82,144,Lauren,Ahhhhhh. [Laughs]
82,145,Gretchen,"Whereas if you have 'The girl hit the boy' or something -- like little kids sometimes hit each other -- that's the more benign version of that example. It's true people sometimes hit each other. This is a thing that you can talk about in languages. It's very often transitive. But also, it can lead to these uncomfortable example sentences where you're like, 'Ah, this seems to be reinforcing certain types of patterns of violence.'"
82,146,Lauren,"Especially when you're writing, say, an entire book that's a descriptive grammar of a language, and again and again you just have these men hitting other people and animals, and you're like, 'I do think this adequately represents what's happening linguistically, but I feel really off about what it's showing people culturally.' It may not even be about this culture. It's about what the linguist is trying to do."
82,147,Gretchen,"Sometimes, people try to replace this with a verb that's less violent like 'kiss.'"
82,148,Lauren,"Also, a bit weird."
82,149,Gretchen,"But that gets into consent issues. If you just go around kissing people, they might not like that. You'd say, 'Well, why not use a verb like 'see'?' But the thing is, 'see' often does extra, additional things in the structure in many languages. Like, some languages you have to use 'see' plus a word meaning 'at' or 'to.' You can't just 'see' someone. You 'see at' someone or 'see to' someone. If you want a very straightforwardly transitive example, something like 'see' is like you have to test it to see whether it works in the language. Yeah, it's very complicated because there aren't a ton of verbs that involve people directly acting on other people, and sometimes they have meanings that you don't want to introduce."
82,150,Lauren,"So, between what you're trying to do linguistically, what level of language you're analysing, and then how you wanna present those examples and the language that you're working with, balancing what's happening with example sentences is really hard."
82,151,Gretchen,"Right. In addition to the named entities sometimes having a gender bias, there's also -- when you're working on a given language, people will often pick a couple common names in that language to use. I think a lot of Japanese examples use the name 'Taro,' which is a relatively common name. I've learned some common names in various languages when you have someone who's doing a paper, and they're like, 'Oh, yeah, these are the two common names that we're gonna use.' You know, picking a couple common names in a given language sort of works. But in English where there're lots of English speakers from lots of different cultures who have lots of different backgrounds, if we leave ourselves with 'John' and 'Mary,' that also presents this 1960s, old-school, very waspy version of who could be an English speaker."
82,152,Lauren,The great this is that you don't have to do this hard work yourself. There's been this great project called the Diverse Names Generator where they've done the work for you of finding names that skew masculine or skew feminine or are gender neutral and come from a range of different linguistic and cultural backgrounds.
82,153,Gretchen,"These names on the Diverse Names Generator website, which is very easy to use, have International Phonetic Alphabet transcriptions, so if you don't necessarily know how to pronounce them, you can see them there. You can add contributions yourself if you think, 'Oh, there could be some more names.' You could just use a baby names book -- and I'm sure people have -- but one of the advantages that this has is it lets you filter for certain types of things that might be relevant to linguists. Sometimes, you wanna have the names in your example sentences, you want the first one to have a name that begins with A, and the next one a name that begins with B, and the next one that begins with C or something, just to help keep track of the different names of participants. You can also do things like filter for certain types of lengths or certain types of initial letters to make them balance out for other types of things you might want in your example sentences. I've also seen recommendations to just use gender neutral, especially very short, names for all of your sentences, so names like 'Lee' or 'Alice' or 'Pat,' 'Sam.' The complication of this is that sometimes gender-neutral names shift depending on the decade. One of these earlier recommendations has 'Kim' as a recommended gender-neutral name. I dunno if that name reads as gender-neutral anymore."
82,154,Lauren,"Hmm, a good reminder that even as we use sample texts that have become traditional in linguistics, it's also worth revisiting them and thinking about what we want to have present in the examples that we create."
82,155,Gretchen,"Right. In addition to making things that are in conversation with this linguistic lineage where there may be hundreds or thousands of examples in a given language, thinking, 'Okay, what could be the future set of examples that we wanna use or the future set of texts that we wanna use, and what are the gaps that we're trying to fill in as far as figuring out what we might wanna be able to compare across languages in the future?'

83,1,Gretchen,"Welcome to Lingthusiasm, a podcast that's enthusiastic about linguistics! I'm Gretchen McCulloch. I'm here with Dr. Pedro Mateo Pedro who's an Assistant Professor at the University of Toronto, Canada, a native speaker of Q'anjob'al, and a learner of Kaqchikel. Today, we're getting enthusiastic about kids acquiring Indigenous languages. But first, some announcements. We love looking up whether two words that look kind of similar are actually historically related, but the history of a word doesn't have to define how it's used today. To celebrate how we can grow up to be more than we ever expected, we have new merch that says, 'Etymology isn't Destiny.' Our artist, Lucy Maddox, has made 'Etymology isn't Destiny' into a swoopy, cursive design with a fun little destiny star on the dot of the eye, available in black, white, and my personal favourite, rainbow gradient. This design is available on lots of different colours and styles of shirts. We've got hoodies, tank tops, t-shirts in classic fit, relaxed fit, curved fit -- plus mugs, notebooks, stickers, water bottles, zipper pouches. You know, if it's on Redbubble, we might've put 'Etymology isn't Destiny' on it. We also have tons of other lingthusiastic merch available in our merch store at lingthusiasm.com/merch. I have to say, it makes a great gift to give to a linguistics enthusiast in your life or to request as a gift if you are that linguistics enthusiast. We also wanna give a special shoutout to our aesthetic redesign of the International Phonetic Alphabet. Last year, we reorganised the classic IPA chart to have colours and have little cute circles and not just be boring grey lines of boxes and to even more elegantly represent the principle that the location of the symbols and rows and columns represents the place and degree of constriction in the mouth. I think it looks really cool. It's also a fun little puzzle to sit there and figure out which of the specific circles around different things stands for what. We've now made this aesthetic IPA chart redesign available on lots more merch options, including several different sizes of posters from small ones you can put on a corkboard to large ones you can put up in your hallway. They look really, really good, especially if you have some sort of office-y space that needs to be decorated. Plus, it's on tote bags and notebooks and t-shirts. If you want everyone you meet to know that you're a giant linguistics nerd, you can take them to conferences and use them to start nerdy conversations with people. If you like the idea of linguistics merch but none of ours so far is quite hitting your aesthetic, or if there's an item that Redbubble sells that you think one of our existing designs would look good on, we've added quite a few merch items in response to people's requests over the years, so we'd love to know where the gaps still are and keep an eye on lingthusiasm.com/merch. Our most recent bonus episode was a behind-the-scenes interview with Sarah Dopierala, who you may recognise as a name from the end credits, about what it's like doing transcripts from a linguistics perspective and her life generally as a linguistics grad student.

83,2,Gretchen,"Hello, Pedro, welcome to the show!"
83,3,Pedro,Hello. Thank you so much for this invitation. I really appreciate it.
83,4,Gretchen,"We're really excited to have you. Let's start with the question that we ask all of our guests, 'How did you get interested in linguistics?'"
83,5,Pedro,"That's an interesting question. I think there're two main things. One is that I had the opportunity to attend a boarding school where there were many Mayan languages and, in addition to that, there was a class on grammar of Mayan languages, and I think that's one of the things that motivated me to be curious about that language. Then after becoming an elementary school teacher, I was also interested about knowing more about how these languages work. For example, how language works in this case -- well, in the case of Guatemala, for example, people think -- I am assuming that that was in the past, but there's, I think, some people who still think that Indigenous languages don't have a grammar from there as well. Is it true that, in fact, there's no grammar of this language? That's kind of how I started --"
83,6,Gretchen,There's no language with no grammar.
83,7,Pedro,That's true. I like when people say that everybody has a mental grammar. I like that. Which is true for every language as well. It's how I would say I got interested in linguistics.
83,8,Gretchen,"And you're already a speaker of Q'anjob'al, and so going to this boarding school and being exposed to other people speaking other languages."
83,9,Pedro,"Also, I acquired Q'anjob'al when I was a kid. And then I went to this boarding school. But unfortunately, I didn't know any of those languages until later when I started living with my wife who is a native speaker of Kaqchikel, and from there I started to learn, but it has been a long process for me."
83,10,Gretchen,"To learn different ones. So, you were at boarding school, and you're encountering, 'Okay, Mayan languages have grammar -- great!' What happened after that?"
83,11,Pedro,"When I graduated from this boarding school, I became an elementary school teacher. I taught, I think, a couple of years. But one thing that I noticed is that there was that need to understand a bit more of the language. I thought, well, this is something that one of my best friends, who is Eladio Mateo Toledo, he said, 'Well, let's find someplace to go.' We went to school in Guatemala City to study sociolinguistics at that time. I'm talking about years ago. But it was a way to find opportunities to learn a little bit more about the languages."
83,12,Gretchen,"So, you studied sociolinguistics in Guatemala City and thought, 'Oh, this is cool. I wanna do more of it'?"
83,13,Pedro,"I finished sociolinguistics, and then I received a fellowship or a scholarship in a different university. It's Universidad Rafael Landívar. There was this project called 'EDUMAYA' where there were scholarships to Mayan speakers or Indigenous speakers in Guatemala. This was an opportunity for me to get an undergrad in linguistics. After that, I think I took two or one year off, but while I missed those years from school, I was working at OKMA -- Oxlajuuj Keej Mayab' Ajtz'iib' -- under the direction of Nora England."
83,14,Gretchen,What is this organisation?
83,15,Pedro,This organisation works on Mayan languages. It's a group of Mayan speakers who studied their own language.
83,16,Gretchen,That sounds great.
83,17,Pedro,"It was really great. In that case, I was an elementary school teacher, and then I started to work very hard at OKMA. It was a huge difference teaching kids and then doing analysis on a language. For me it was a big transition, but it was amazing because I had the opportunity to learn many things about how Mayan language work. It was unique."
83,18,Gretchen,And the kids that you were teaching when you were teaching in school were Mayan kids as well?
83,19,Pedro,"Yeah, most of them were Mayan kids, so they spoke Q'anjob'al. Even though there is this idea about bilingual education in these Indigenous communities, I had this opportunity to teach these children in Q'anjob'al. One of the norms of education is you teach these kids, and they have to learn Spanish and something like that. So, what I did is, okay, let's take as the base the knowledge that they bring from home. They speak the language, they understand the language, so we need to teach them how to write and read. That's what I did. I was in trouble because the parents didn't like the idea of teaching the children in Q'anjob'al."
83,20,Gretchen,They wanted them to learn Spanish.
83,21,Pedro,"Exactly. They said, 'Why do we need Q'anjob'al? Why do we need to write when we speak the language?' One of the arguments I made is, okay, yeah, but we need something already that will help us to learn to write and read. It took me a while. One way to convince the parents to change their mind was that, in the first meeting when they came in to get their children's grade, I started the meeting in Spanish. I messaged them in Spanish. It didn't last for a minute, and they stopped me. They started to complain and say, 'Why would you talk to us in Spanish when, in fact, you know that we speak Q'anjob'al?' Different people, they were angry or uncomfortable because of that. After that, I asked them this question, 'Have you thought about your children who spend about five or six hours every day here at school?'"
83,22,Gretchen,"'And if I speak to them in Spanish, they're not gonna understand me either.'"
83,23,Pedro,"Exactly. That was my point. And this 'Oh, yeah, yeah.' 'Have you thought about that? Do they complain?' 'No.' 'Okay, because they are kids.'"
83,24,Gretchen,"They don't know any better, yeah."
83,25,Pedro,"For me, it's important for these children to understand what's going on in school. One way to do this -- using the language that they know. I was able, in this case, to talk with the parents, 'Okay, we understand what you are after.' I had the opportunity then to teach the children, at least, I mean, at that time -- so divide a year in two parts. In the first part, I would teach the kids in writing and reading Q'anjob'al. And then in the next part of the year, we switched to Spanish. But at least that was an opportunity to --"
83,26,Gretchen,"They have sort of a balance of the two and accommodation of the two, and they're not coming in and suddenly someone's talking at them in a language they don't understand at all -- 'Okay, what's going on?' Yeah."
83,27,Pedro,Those were the things that I really liked when I go back to that experience that I had as an elementary school teacher.
83,28,Gretchen,Then you started doing language work with other linguists and speakers.
83,29,Pedro,"Yeah. Again, when I came to OKMA, I started working with a group of Q'anjob'al speakers on the dialectal variation of Q'anjob'al. I was there, I think, less than three years. Then I left Guatemala because my wife had a scholarship, and we went to the US. That's how I started learning English, and then started the MA and PhD programme at the University of Kansas."
83,30,Gretchen,In linguistics as well?
83,31,Pedro,"In linguistics, yeah. Then I started to work on how children acquire Mayan languages -- of course, not all Mayan languages, but I started to work on Q'anjob'al to document how these children acquire Q'anjob'al."
83,32,Gretchen,"Sort of informed by this experience as a schoolteacher saying, 'Okay, these kids are coming in already speaking this language. What's going on?'"
83,33,Pedro,"I think the question is, 'What do they know?' That's how I got interested in this. Plus, at that time I had my first son who was, I think, one-year-and-a-half or something. It was like, okay, this is an opportunity for me to learn how to document child language acquisition. So, then I started to work on Q'anjob'al."
83,34,Gretchen,"I think there are a lot of linguists who get interested in child language acquisition because you have a child, you're spending all this time taking care of your child, 'What are they doing?'"
83,35,Pedro,"For me, it was really interesting because, again, going back to when we moved from Guatemala to the US, the first time I took care of my son, so I made basically a diary of what he was saying almost every day. I have my notes -- I dunno -- somewhere."
83,36,Gretchen,Then you started looking at other children as well.
83,37,Pedro,"Yeah. For my MA, for example, I looked at, I think, eight or ten children. It was a cross-sectional study. As for my PhD, I worked on a longitudinal study. My main focus at that time was on how these children acquire the verb morphology in the language, in this case, the word that indicates action, for example, what happens, and then the different parts that are necessary in that verb, for example. We talk about when the action happened, and who is participating in the action. Those are the kinds of things that I tried to evaluate in my study. That's something that, also, I have been working on these days."
83,38,Gretchen,"I mean, this is the kind of thing that it's not like, oh, you study it for one degree, and now you know everything. This is the kind of thing that people could study for a whole career."
83,39,Pedro,"Exactly. That's an interesting point because what I have learned is that, okay, I'm going to -- so my advisor said, 'Well, you can start with this.' And I said, 'Well, okay.' I started studying acquisition of the verb morphology, I think, more than 10 years ago. And I thought, 'Well, I am done.' It's not true! Because every time I look at the data, and I find other things, and I start asking other questions. There is no end of that -- which is a nice thing that you start with something small --"
83,40,Gretchen,You're not gonna be out of a job.
83,41,Pedro,"It's nice. I think one thing that I really appreciate is the opportunity that I have also in documenting acquisition for Mayan languages. For example, I have documented the acquisition of Chuj, another written Mayan language to Q'anjob'al, for example. By looking into a known language, it helps me to understand what must be going on in Q'anjob'al. And I said, 'Wow! I wish I had access to this language before so I could have a better idea of how to explain what was going on.'"
83,42,Gretchen,"You can find some things that are similar between Chuj and Q'anjob'al, and some things that are different, because the languages are grammatically, you know, related. They're similar."
83,43,Pedro,"That really helped in terms of analysis, in terms of understanding what's going on, in terms of explaining a specific phenomenon, for example. It really helps to have that kind of mirror, for example, to see what's going on."
83,44,Gretchen,"One thing that I know about when kids are acquiring English is they often make mistakes. They'll say things like 'runned' instead of 'ran' or something like that. This tells you 'Oh, they're generalising something about a rule.' Are there some things that come up with mistakes kids make or interesting things that kids do when they're acquiring --"
83,45,Pedro,"That's an interesting question. That's something I was looking at, for example, for Chuj and for Q'anjob'al is that, so in Mayan languages, for example, there is this suffix that is known as the 'status suffix' that appears after a verb. The idea of this status of something, like, it's indicating what information is provided by the verb."
83,46,Gretchen,'Style' suffix?
83,47,Pedro,"'Status.' 'Status suffix.' It indicates whether the verb is a transitive verb or an intransitive verb. In this case, when we talk about intransitive verbs, it's one participant of the verb. Transitive verb -- two participants."
83,48,Gretchen,"So, if you have something like 'walk,' it's gonna be intransitive, and it's gonna have one status suffix. If you have something like, well, the classic example is 'hit,' but I always find that very violent -- you know, 'hug' or something -- that's gonna be transitive. And it's gonna have a different suffix."
83,49,Pedro,"A different -- yeah. In English, for example, that's just one form of the verb. But in Mayan languages, or someplace, you have a specific morphology on the verb to indicate that, well, you are talking about an intransitive verb or a transitive verb."
83,50,Gretchen,"So, if it's just 'I eat,' it's gonna have one status suffix. If it's 'I eat an apple,' it's gonna have a different status suffix to indicate that that's there. Okay."
83,51,Pedro,"I think, trying to answer your question, that all of this -- I mean, there are all things that happen with this status suffix, but I haven't seen children, for example, producing errors with these status suffixes. One thing that we have seen as maybe 'errors' or children overgeneralising is the production of the status suffixes in a specific position. One thing that we know about status suffixes is that sometimes they appear at the end of a verb, and other times, they don't. But in other times, they do. Then the question is, 'What happened?'"
83,52,Gretchen,And adults know this?
83,53,Pedro,"An adult knows. But for a child, there are different variations on these status suffixes that a child has to find as a challenge. One thing that we notice is that these children, for example, produce these suffixes in non-final position -- something that is not seen --"
83,54,Gretchen,"The adults only produce it at the end of the verb, at the end of the sentence?"
83,55,Pedro,Yes and no. If they have what we call a 'root verb' -- consonant-vowel-consonant is the idea.
83,56,Gretchen,"Consonant-vowel-consonant is a 'root verb,' okay."
83,57,Pedro,"When you have that verb with that 'shape,' let's say, that suffix doesn't appear in the non-final position. But if you have something that is, let's say, derived, then that suffix has to be there."
83,58,Gretchen,Okay. If you make the verb into something else by changing the tense or something --
83,59,Pedro,"By changing the status of that word. You have the word 'song,' for example, and then you make the verb 'to sing,' then you add a morpheme to it so that this noun 'song' becomes an intransitive. Because of that, then it's a derived intransitive verb."
83,60,Gretchen,"It's a derived intransitive, and you need to have the suffix. Do the kids do this?"
83,61,Pedro,"They produce that. One thing that we noticed is that they make that difference between derived and non-derived intransitive verbs. Again, it's like they are acquiring that, but that's what we see as something problematic for them in acquiring those status suffixes."
83,62,Gretchen,They have some difficulties still.
83,63,Pedro,"That's, I would say, where we see them making those mistakes or having trouble with acquiring the suffixes."
83,64,Gretchen,Is there something that you've noticed that's interesting about how kids are acquiring the languages you've worked on?
83,65,Pedro,"In addition to looking at the verb morphology, I also studied how children acquire the nominal classifier -- numeral classifier -- in Q'anjob'al. In this case, some Mayan languages have a nominal classifier or a numeral classifier. In this language, for example, everything has to be classified. If you refer to a woman, for example, you're going to use the classifier 'ix,' and then 'naq,' for example, for men. Then if you have other things like --"
83,66,Gretchen,"You know, a hat or something."
83,67,Pedro,"Then it would be 'chʼen,' for example."
83,68,Gretchen,"That's for objects in general, or are there several different kinds of objects?"
83,69,Pedro,"Well, for animals, for people, for objects, and things like that."
83,70,Gretchen,"So, if you have a dog or something?"
83,71,Pedro,"That's going to be different. That's going to be 'no'.' I was interacting with this child. He was a boy. Well, first, he was interacting with his grandmother. These classifiers were there. He was like 'ix' or 'naq' or 'chem' or 'ch'en' or 'no'' -- everything that was --"
83,72,Gretchen,Everything that you would expect for all the different kinds of things that you can refer to.
83,73,Pedro,"And then someone came to visit grandma. So, grandma left the conversation, so that left just the boy and myself. This is what happened. All of those classifiers were gone. There's just one that stayed, which is 'ix.'"
83,74,Gretchen,"So, he's using 'ix' for everything."
83,75,Pedro,'Ix' for everything. But this is not something that he's just making up. It's something that we can see in the other grammar.
83,76,Gretchen,Okay. Do other children do this as well?
83,77,Pedro,"Other children do, but mainly boys -- not girls."
83,78,Gretchen,Interesting.
83,79,Pedro,The thing is that this 'ix' that replaces all nominal classifiers occurs mainly among men. People have argued that it's mostly in informal contexts.
83,80,Gretchen,"Right. So, because his grandma is gone, and you two are men together -- well, he's like, 3 years old."
83,81,Pedro,"Exactly. It's kind of like, 'Okay, yeah, let's use the 'ix,'' replacing the others."
83,82,Gretchen,"He's sensitive to the sociolinguistic context of 'Oh, women aren't here anymore, so I'm gonna do this thing' --"
83,83,Pedro,'With this guy.'
83,84,Gretchen,'With this guy.' Even at this young age.
83,85,Pedro,"Exactly. He was about 2-and-a-half or 3 years old. This boy is able to distinguish both contexts. His grandma has come back in the conversation, and then those classifiers came back."
83,86,Gretchen,Wow. He's really paying attention to this dynamic situation of whether his grandma is here or not changing how he talks.
83,87,Pedro,"When to use all the classifiers and when to use just one classifier. For me, again, that's a way to illustrate that these children, they're exposed to the language, and they are exposed to this system of the nominal classifier, but in addition to that information, the social aspect of that nominal --"
83,88,Gretchen,"And the cultural context where if you just had kids who are trying to learn language in a classroom while maybe the teacher is a woman, and you don't have all the different types of social situations."
83,89,Pedro,"One of the things that's important to emphasise, then, when we do language documentation is making sure that that interaction with that child doesn't happen only with grandma, for example, but happens with the different gender -- I mean, in this case, female/male, and also --"
83,90,Gretchen,Ages.
83,91,Pedro,And there's ages and the kids themselves.
83,92,Gretchen,Because maybe the kids are talking differently with each other than they're talking with their grandparents or their aunts and uncles or the older generation. The researcher doesn't necessarily know in advance which things the kids are gonna be paying attention to because maybe the kids don't learn how to talk like the men until they're older. You don't know what age they learn that until you're studying it.
83,93,Pedro,"Exactly. I would say the take home message in this part of the conversation is documenting everything, basically, because you never know, I mean, what you will learn. I mean, you never know what will come with this child's interaction."
83,94,Gretchen,"I think sometimes when we're analysing how kids talk, at least a lot of the studies that I see on big languages like English, they bring the kid and maybe one parent, the mom or something, into a lab and they have them talk in this controlled but also very artificial environment. You don't have the environments of, 'Well, somebody comes to the door, so grandma has to go answer the door' that lets you have this situation where you can illuminate this effect. Sometimes, if you do too much control, you don't actually see the natural things that happen."
83,95,Pedro,"That's the difference that we see, I mean, in this case between doing an experimental study and a naturalistic setting, for example. I think when you do certain things in that natural setting, then you have the opportunity to see the language being used in different contexts, for example. In this case that we are discussing for the 'ix,' I think it's a unique illustration of the importance of documenting the language as a whole."
83,96,Gretchen,"In the whole community, cultural context. I mean, of course, then you also have the thing of like, 'Oh, if there's some birds in the background or something.'"
83,97,Pedro,"Again, that's the advantage and disadvantage of doing this kind of work. I think it's good to do both, especially when we talk about Indigenous languages. You mentioned something important, 'Okay, what do we know, for example, about language acquisition?' I think most of that information comes from the well-known languages. What happens to these less studied languages or languages that haven't been studied at all, for example -- how to bring those languages into discussing what we learn about language acquisition?"
83,98,Gretchen,"And there's two reasons why that's really important. One is because, for speakers of those languages, if they want to try to support using them in schools or using them in daily life or trying to revitalise a language that's become less common in daily life, having the knowledge of 'How do kids talk in this language? What are their first words like? How do adults normally talk to children in a bit of a different style?'"
83,99,Pedro,"I think we can say that it's not just about the grammatical aspect of the language that these kids are acquiring, but at the same time, how they are acquiring that language, for example. I think one thing that it would be good to connect with language revitalisation is, like, let's learn the language thinking like we are kids. Because a kid, for example, wouldn't think about 'Oh, is this the way to say it?' 'Should I put this here?'"
83,100,Gretchen,'Should I put this suffix on this verb?'
83,101,Pedro,Exactly.
83,102,Gretchen,Kids don't know what a suffix is.
83,103,Pedro,"And it takes time for them to get to the production of the adult level. For instance, also the sound system that these children produce. Q'anjob'al, for example, has retroflex sounds like /ʈʂʰ/ or /ʈʂʼ/, for example, /ʂ/. And these kids do not produce them like --"
83,104,Gretchen,They can't produce them immediately.
83,105,Pedro,"No, no, no. It takes time for them. I will say three-years-and-a-half or four. It takes that time to produce this retroflex. I think when we are in the context of revitalisation, those learners of a language will go through similar patterns of acquisition."
83,106,Gretchen,"If you're trying to re-learn Q'anjob'al as an adult and being stressed that you can't produce the retroflex and say, 'Look, it takes the kids four years. If it takes you four years, that's really normal. You can keep practicing this and get better at it. If you can't do it on the first day, then you still have hope.'"
83,107,Pedro,That's the importance of doing this kind of project and documenting how children acquire this kind of language. Then this information can be useful for other purposes.
83,108,Gretchen,"Q'anjob'al also has the ejectives, which I'm not doing a very good job of pronouncing, but you've been saying it in the name of the language itself that 'Q'anjob'al.'"
83,109,Pedro,"/qʼanxobʼal/, yes."
83,110,Gretchen,"Do kids learn those really early, or are they a bit harder?"
83,111,Pedro,"It takes time for them as well. That's another interesting question because what we have noticed is that these children, when they try to produce these ejectives, they would follow two strategies. One -- either they produce the plain consonant."
83,112,Gretchen,So /kanxobal/ instead of /qʼanxobal/?
83,113,Pedro,Exactly. Or they would just produce the glottal stop.
83,114,Gretchen,"Oh, okay, so /ʔnxobal/?"
83,115,Pedro,"Or something like /ʔanxobal/, but I'm just making this up. It will be something like this -- either they use a plain or this glottal stop. It's a process."
83,116,Gretchen,Extracting the two possible features that you would need to put together eventually.
83,117,Pedro,"This has been reported for the acquisition of sounds in K'iche' and Chuj, and I also see it in Q'anjob'al."
83,118,Gretchen,These are all Mayan languages that have --
83,119,Pedro,"Mayan languages that have ejectives as well. Maybe someone will say, 'This is our dialectal variation,' or 'It's just the kids,' I mean, because of individual differences, but no, it's across --"
83,120,Gretchen,"It's across a bunch of them. That gets us to the other reason why it's really important to document kids acquiring lots of different languages -- Indigenous languages -- is that, when we're trying to think, 'What do we think about how kids learn language in general?' if we base those theories entirely on a few big languages that have other relatively similar typological features in some cases -- English and Spanish are typologically related, and so if you're coming up with a theory just based on English and Spanish, well, you know, that's not very generalisable."
83,121,Pedro,"That's true. I think that's one of the other things that we wanted to mention here, like how to include other languages to understand human language and also how these children acquire languages -- human languages in the world, you mentioned, that sometimes haven't been explored at all. It would be good to document those languages and have a better idea of what these kids do. But the other thing that I'm going to add here is that, yeah, we want to have a better idea of how these children acquire language, but at the same time, how this information can be used, again, for language revitalisation or for language maintenance or things that the community's interested in. One thing that I noticed, for example, about this in Q'anjob'al is that these children, their first words have a basic shape which is consonant-vowel-consonant. This is really common in the whole Mayan languages, but these are the specific things that these children produce. If that's the case, then is this information possible to use when we consider creating teaching materials for these children? It would be a good thing to have this because it's going to be much easier if these children can read these words with this shape, for example."
83,122,Gretchen,"Right. If you know what words they're acquiring early, then you can say, 'Oh, well, we'll put those words in maybe the first books that we're trying to have them learn because you don't wanna try to have them read a book with words that they don't understand, they're not using already. You can use this small shape -- because Mayan languages have, you know, quite a bit of prefixes and suffixes and things on the words but, of course, you have to start somewhere, and that's just with -- the roots are generally consonant-vowel-consonant, so they just produce the root first, and then they start adding things onto it."
83,123,Pedro,"Exactly. They are good at identifying those roots in the input or in the adult grammar in this case, yeah. Also, I had the opportunity to collaborate with other people about trying to understand how these pieces are put in the verb. What we have noticed is that there's the root, and then children are good at producing suffixes."
83,124,Gretchen,Ah. But not prefixes?
83,125,Pedro,"Not prefixes, but for a reason."
83,126,Gretchen,What's that?
83,127,Pedro,Stress.
83,128,Gretchen,Oh.
83,129,Pedro,Stress is also with these suffixes. You have the root and then the suffix.
83,130,Gretchen,"And that's the part they do first, and then they do the prefixes much later."
83,131,Pedro,"Yeah, later."
83,132,Gretchen,Interesting.
83,133,Pedro,That's the other thing that we have.
83,134,Gretchen,"So, you work at the University of Toronto now."
83,135,Pedro,Yes.
83,136,Gretchen,What sorts of projects are you working on there?
83,137,Pedro,"Well, my position is about language documentation and language revitalisation. One of the projects that I am currently working on is about the revitalisation of Itza', another Mayan language spoken in Guatemala, in the northern part of Guatemala, in Petén. It's a language that has been considered an endangered language because it has less than 40 speakers."
83,138,Gretchen,Wow. Less than 40.
83,139,Pedro,"And most of them are elders. I think this week I was asked about how old is the youngest, and I said, 'Well, 70-something.' Children are not acquiring that language anymore. But the goal in this project is how to teach the language and how to bring the language back. That's one of the projects that I am doing -- how to do that. One thing that we are doing with the community is two main things, 1.) is developing a workshop on teaching them how to teach the language."
83,140,Gretchen,Right. Because just because you can speak a language doesn't mean you know how to teach it.
83,141,Pedro,"That's one of the things that we did. What would be the best method? We're using a method that has been used in other contexts, so let's try to use this for the revitalisation of Itza', in this case, not for all Mayan languages, but for Itza' because of the condition of it."
83,142,Gretchen,Because Q'anjob'al still has lots of speakers.
83,143,Pedro,"Lots of speakers, yeah, so it's different from Itza'. So, that's one thing. The other thing we are doing -- and for me this is really important because we are developing pedagogical material that we are using for the same purpose, but the unique thing for this grammar is that we have students at the University of Toronto who are involved in creating information about the grammar. In this case, these students are doing research about the subject of Itza', but because they are preparing this material for non-linguists, for example, it's an opportunity for them, okay, they have to understand the structure of the language but then how to share that information with people who are not linguists."
83,144,Gretchen,"Who wanna become speakers and don't have background in grammar or any of these theoretical concepts, but they just need to know how to talk to people."
83,145,Pedro,"For me, these students have this opportunity to learn to speak the language and then also the opportunity how to share that information with these people, but in addition to that, having the opportunity to work with Indigenous communities and also doing language revitalisation."
83,146,Gretchen,"And trying to accomplish the community's goals rather than, okay, I have this research agenda, I'm just gonna show up, extract some information, and then go off and get a degree and have a career without benefitting the community."
83,147,Pedro,"I think that's something that I tried to tell the students. Okay, it's good that you are learning this. You're doing your research. But at the same time, this is the impact that you are making with your work. Maybe you cannot see it now, but later, you will realise, 'Oh, this is what' -- it takes time to understand what you are doing. Again, I consider this as an opportunity for the students to be involved in this situation. The other part is, in addition to the workshop on teaching methods, we are also working with community members about the different lessons that we are putting into this grammar. How can we do this? Or how do we do this? Or how do we say this? Basic expressions."
83,148,Gretchen,"So, if you wanna have a lesson about foods, you wanna make sure you're using the foods that are in the local area that they wanna be able to talk about not some sort of food that nobody's actually eating in this place."
83,149,Pedro,"Exactly. But again, just by doing that, it's a long process. It has been a long process. We have been working on this grammar, I think, more than a year, and we are not even done. But still, that is helping us to understand how to work with the community, but at the same time, how to work with the elders who have the knowledge of the language, for example. I was telling some of the colleagues a while ago saying that, okay, I was asked whether this pedagogical grammar will be going on under review. I said, 'Well, it's going under review at the moment with the elders.'"
83,150,Gretchen,"Right. It's not necessarily going under peer review by academics, you're having the true experts, which is the elders, look at it and say, 'What do we think? Do we think this is a reasonable reflection of our language?' How is it like for you as a speaker of a different Mayan language to go into a different community? Do you think this makes it complicated for you or interesting?"
83,151,Pedro,"It's really interesting for me because I always consider this as an opportunity to work with another group of Mayan speakers but also an opportunity to help them because, I mean, as Mayan speakers or as Indigenous speakers, for example, we go through the same situation. For me, it's really important to consider that. But I also feel like I have built this good relationship with them and to work in this project. But one thing that I would like to mention is that even though I am a Mayan speaker, even though I am from Guatemala, one thing that I have tried to emphasise is like, showing respect for them. Again, they are different cultures. I mean, we're Mayan, but our way of living is not the same. I think I try to respect that, like, yes, I am from there, but that doesn't mean I have impulse things."
83,152,Gretchen,It doesn't mean you know everything already.
83,153,Pedro,"No, no, no, no. I always say this -- I am also learning with them. I am helping. We are developing this project. But we are learning together. That's the approach I take when working on these kinds of projects."
83,154,Gretchen,And you're also coming in with the backing of a big Canadian research institution and this sort of stuff which puts you in a different situation.
83,155,Pedro,"I think it's a lot of responsibility. I think one thing that I am learning is that, yes, we have to do language revitalisation, but I think there's another component that we have to consider that's about the research aspect of that. One thing that I noticed about what I am doing is working in the infrastructure of the project, building that relationship, working with elders, working with the different activists in the language, for example. I think that's the first step. Now, we are doing this, but as for research, you asked me, I don't have much to say, but again, I think building that infrastructure, it takes time. But if I try to think a little bit more, I would say, well, we have some results of this project. I could mention two. One of them is that we have trained some speakers of the language about the teaching method. They are using this method to teach the language. We are about to finish up this pedagogical grammar for the language. I think those can be considered as 'results.'"
83,156,Gretchen,"That's balancing the way that you have to talk to funding agencies and universities and these bodies that care about results that you can report in a list somewhere while also saying, 'Okay, but we actually care about the results that the community members care about, which is having more people able to speak the language,' which is not actually what the research institutions are trying to fund. So, there's lots of different people who have different priorities that you're trying to balance between."
83,157,Pedro,"But for me, that's an opportunity of how to communicate those ideas and how to make that balance. Sure, research will come. Research will grow."
83,158,Gretchen,But the relationship --
83,159,Pedro,"But the question, 'Is it easy to start?' It will take a little bit of time. I think one of the things I would like to mention here, a 'keyword,' I would say, is to be patient. Sometimes, we want to see really fast."
83,160,Gretchen,"Results really fast, yeah."
83,161,Pedro,"It takes time, yeah. That's one thing that I see. I also see that this project will grow, and I think there will be more students who will be more interested in working in the project. That's my hope."
83,162,Gretchen,"I hope so, too. If people wanna know more information about Q'anjob'al or Chuj or any of the other research that's being done on Mayan languages, is there somewhere where they should start for more information?"
83,163,Pedro,"I think if you are interested to know more about, in this case, the work that I do, I would recommend exploring my personal website. You can go to linguistics, the University of Toronto, and then you will find my personal website."
83,164,Gretchen,We'll link to that from the description as well so people can follow that for more information.
83,165,Pedro,Thank you.
83,166,Gretchen,"If you could leave people knowing one thing about linguistics, what would that be?"
83,167,Pedro,"That's a good question. I would like to say the following -- when you do linguistics, it's good to start with something small. It's good that you start with that something small and then start asking questions that maybe you don't have answer to that question, but you will find answers to that question. I hope I can connect that or relate that to what I mentioned in the discussion that we had today. Remember, I said that I started studying the verb in Q'anjob'al -- and I am not done exploring that. Start with something small. But the other thing is that, yes, as a linguist, for example, or as a researcher, you have your own agenda, but try to reflect a little bit about, also, the community's agenda and the community's needs. I think that's important to have that in mind and also important for you to build a relationship with that community that you are working with. [Music]"

84,5,Gretchen,"Oh, we sure do. I mean, I don't think the language learning platforms are all bad. I just wouldn't feel comfortable endorsing one without trying it out for hundreds of hours, at which point, that's not really very cost effective. It's easier to just say no.

84,8,Lauren,"'Hey, look! This is a podcast.'"
84,9,Gretchen,"'Yes, THIS episode, right here, now.' Lauren, no one can see that you're pointing right now."
84,10,Lauren,"Hm, yeah, it's a pity because this is one of my favourite types of episodes where we're gonna talk about gesture in an audio-only format."
84,11,Gretchen,"You know, you really picked a very interesting combination of being a gesture specialist in so far as your research goes and also having a podcast which is audio-only."
84,12,Lauren,That's okay because one of my favourite things to do is explain gestures that we do all the time in a whole lot of detail because it makes you realise how impressive they are. Pointing is one of my favourites of these.
84,13,Gretchen,"So, O Pointing Expert, tell us about pointing."
84,14,Lauren,"Pointing is a very human activity where we use a part of our body, and we project out from our body this invisible line towards something. Another human is able to look at that point, and look at that invisible line, and figure out what our invisible line is pointing at and figure out that we're looking at the same thing. We do this without thinking about it all the time."
84,15,Gretchen,"We humans do this invisible string, invisible line thing that can be following a finger or the whole hand, or an eye gaze, or several things like that. Do animals do this?"
84,16,Lauren,"It depends on what animals we're talking about. Apes, our nearest relations, they gesture, but they don't point, and they don't seem to get the idea of pointing."
84,17,Gretchen,"If you try to point to something, a gorilla or a chimpanzee or a bonobo or something is gonna be like, 'I don't know. I'm just gonna look at your finger,' or whatever."
84,18,Lauren,"Yeah. There's hundreds of hours of chimpanzee gesture studies and gorilla gesture studies, and they don't point. It's not part of their communicative collection of skills. But dogs are really good at following human points."
84,19,Gretchen,Dogs don't necessarily point themselves.
84,20,Lauren,They don't necessarily point themselves.
84,21,Gretchen,"But if you point to something, they can follow that. I feel like I've seen humans try to point at a treat or something that's on the ground for a dog, and the dog is just sitting there looking at your finger being like, 'I don't know what you want from me.' Finally, you tap your foot by the treat, and the dog's like, 'Oh, this, okay.' But you're saying that maybe I should've just trained this dog better."
84,22,Lauren,Let me clarify. Some dogs seem to do it with very little training. Some dogs seem to take more training but can follow a point -- compared to wolves which are not domesticated and don't engage with pointing. There is a research paper that says that cats don't engage with pointing either.
84,23,Gretchen,"Do cats just not engage with pointing, or do they not want to engage with pointing that they understand perfectly well?"
84,24,Lauren,The paper doesn't make clear --
84,25,Gretchen,[Laughs] We don't know. They're cats.
84,26,Lauren,"We can't know what happens in the minds of cats. I have had students, when I've talked about non-humans and pointing, say that their cat can follow pointing. This is perhaps an under-researched area, and there may be cats that have this skill. Maybe all cats have this skill and have just decided to withhold it from us. But beyond humans, pointing is not necessarily a skill that other animals have."
84,27,Gretchen,That is kind of fascinating because I think of it as pretty basic. A lot of babies can point before they can talk.
84,28,Lauren,Mm-hm. Pointing is normally a pathway to other forms of language and communication.
84,29,Gretchen,"You can train animals to respond to particular words, but it's harder to train them to respond to points."
84,30,Lauren,"It's because of that magic invisible line between -- they just look at your finger. In fact, it's weird that we don't immediately just look at the end of someone's finger and instead we look at some invisible line shooting off."
84,31,Gretchen,"You can't see me right now, but I have my hand up, and I'm pointing an invisible finger, and there it is. You said, 'invisible finger.' Sometimes, pointing happens with the index finger. Sometimes, it happens with the middle finger, with the whole hand. I guess you could point with your elbow if your hands were occupied. Or maybe you could point with your thumb if you're pointing back in that direction. Is there research on pointing with various parts of the body?"
84,32,Lauren,"Absolutely. We talk about pointing with the finger and particularly the index finger as the most common. When we were pointing -- that you couldn't see at the top of the episode -- that might have been the kind of pointing you were thinking of, but it's by no means the only way that pointing happens. There are different ways of pointing that are easier in communication. You mentioned if your hands are full, you might point with your elbow or your foot or a little chin flick. When we're pointing at something that's not a specific thing but maybe like a group of trees or somewhere far away, we might use an open hand rather than the more narrow line of a specific finger."
84,33,Gretchen,"That's true. If you're trying to create an invisible web or an invisible waft of string -- I dunno how the metaphor goes -- trying to paint with a broad, invisible brush."
84,34,Lauren,"If we're pointing to someone or something behind us, it's often easier to just do a little flick of the thumb backwards. It's just the shape of the hand makes that easier to do. We don't think of that as strange."
84,35,Gretchen,I'm currently pointing behind me with my index finger. It is very awkward. I hope everyone who's listening is also trying out these points.
84,36,Lauren,"There's this really wonderful corpus study from Kensy Cooperrider -- who a lot of this work comes from because he did his entire PhD thesis on pointing -- where if you're pointing towards yourself as a physical thing, you will use your index finger, but if you're talking about yourself as an identity, as a human, embodied, living creature with a mind, the mental you, you're more likely to do it with an open hand."
84,37,Gretchen,Interesting. I was feeling myself doing that as you were saying it.
84,38,Lauren,"Sometimes, the variation is what's easiest for your hands to do, and sometimes, it does convey something slightly different. Like, I'm pointing at one thing or many things in the distance."
84,39,Gretchen,That makes sense.
84,40,Lauren,"Sometimes, the difference is depending on the culture that you're in and the cultural practices you have. Middle finger pointing -- a lot of kids will point with their middle finger just because they're figuring out manual dexterity. It's hard to wiggle your fingers around, and it is very funny, but it is also a common way of pointing in some cultures. There's some really nice work from Central Australia that people will default use their middle finger rather than their index finger."
84,41,Gretchen,"So, these would be cultures where the middle finger doesn't have this taboo, obscene meaning that it has for me and a lot of English speakers."
84,42,Lauren,Indeed.
84,43,Gretchen,"Because that's certainly something that overrides the pointing meaning. I have seen some English speakers point with their middle finger, and I'm always giggling, but, yeah, people do do it sometimes."
84,44,Lauren,"Once you notice it, you realise it is more common. We have this idea of default ways of pointing, and things are actually a lot more varied. Also, eye pointing. Again, Kensy Cooperrider has this really nice paper on Yupno from Papua New Guinea where people will do this really prominent gaze and pop of their eyes towards something as a way of pointing. Lip pointing is a thing that we see whether it's the lower lip or both lips purse outwards. In Southeast Asia we see this, across Africa. There's a really cute scene in Encanto, which is set in Columbia, where Mirabel points with her lips towards a gift she wants to give her little cousin. It's this really sweet moment and a really nice culturally appropriate use of pointing."
84,45,Gretchen,"That's great. I think I could do eye pointing especially if I was in a public space and trying to gesture to 'Oh, this person has a really cool hat on' or something, and I didn't wanna put out my full hand and be like, 'Oh my god, check out that person's hat!' I'm gonna be like, 'Look, look behind you. There's a person with a cool hat.' But I don't think I have lip pointing for myself."
84,46,Lauren,Yeah. Because we get this cultural variation. That's really interesting to see across the world. We also have variation in what it is not appropriate to point at or how it's not appropriate to point. There's this amazing study that Robert Blust did over the years of collecting examples of cultures where it's rude to point at rainbows. He collected 124 different examples of cultures where it is taboo to point at a rainbow.
84,47,Gretchen,"It's bad luck or something to be like, 'Oh my god, look, a rainbow,' pointing at it?"
84,48,Lauren,Exactly. These cultures are so spread out around the world that it's not likely to be something that was a recent cultural story that they all share. It's from all corners of the world.
84,49,Gretchen,"It may be really ancient or something. That's fascinating. I definitely don't have any taboos about pointing to rainbows. I probably always point at a rainbow when I see it because I'm like, 'Oh, great, a rainbow, look!'"
84,50,Lauren,I feel more compelled to point because it's so exciting to see one. You may have a taboo around pointing at people.
84,51,Gretchen,"Hmm, I mean, I guess, in some contexts."
84,52,Lauren,"Given that you were just doing a low-key eye point at someone's cool hat. You probably wouldn't do a big index finger point at someone in public and be like, 'Cool hat!'"
84,53,Gretchen,"I feel like that's especially if there's a kid, and they're commenting on some aspect of the body. They'd be like, 'Oh my god, Mommy, look at that lady's blue hair!' And you're like, 'Oh, I'm so sorry. My kid should not be commenting on you.'"
84,54,Lauren,"I can just hear the parent voice that's like, 'Don't point. It's rude to point.' This is clearly a taboo I have been taught."
84,55,Gretchen,"I don't know that I've been taught so much it's rude to point as I've been taught it's rude to comment on strangers' appearances in public in a way that they can hear you, but I think it comes down to a similar type of thing."
84,56,Lauren,"Yeah. Because an index finger point, in particular, is really prominent and visible and very obvious what's happening, and so you can see how that fits in with that taboo. It says a lot about the name 'index finger' as a term for that finger that we have between our thumb and our middle finger."
84,57,Gretchen,"So, that '-dex' in 'index' is from a Greek word meaning 'pointing' or 'showing.'"
84,58,Lauren,Which is why an index in the back of a book points back to other bits of the book that you might wanna read on that topic or an economic index points to something that's happening in the economy.
84,59,Gretchen,"You sometimes get, especially in older texts, this drawn pointing index finger in the side of the book which can point to particular passages and say, 'Oh, this is particularly important' or 'This is interesting.' People would draw them in by hand or they could be somewhere to index particular things. It's also related to a word that's used for various types of pointing things -- both gestural pointing and grammatical pointing -- in linguistics."
84,60,Lauren,"We've called them 'pointing gestures' so far, but the more technical term for them is 'deictic gestures.'"
84,61,Gretchen,"'Deixis' is one of those words that, at the same time, it's so useful, and it's so cool, and it's so hard to say, and it's so hard to spell."
84,62,Lauren,"I have genuinely double-checked the spelling several times even just in the preparation of this show because you have 'deixis,' which is D-E-I-X-I-S, and then 'deictic,' which is related, is D-E-I-C-T-I-C."
84,63,Gretchen,"So, you could say 'a deictic word' or a 'deictic gesture.' That's just the adjective form. That one's got a C instead of an X. I hear people say /daɪɪksis/ /dɛɪksis/ /daɪksis/. There's all these different ways of saying it. It's not spelled like the '-dex' in 'index.' There's an extra I in there. It's so useful, and there're so many things that are deictic, and I wanna talk about it all the time, and yet, it's this word that feels very complicated. Hopefully, by saying it a lot in this episode, we can point a path toward it being more useable in the future, maybe."
84,64,Lauren,"Excellent. We do tend to use 'pointing' and 'deixis' interchangeably, but I guess 'deixis' is the academic term for pointing."
84,65,Gretchen,"Right. It's useful to have an academic term because there are a lot of grammatical things that are deictic that we don't necessarily think of as being literal pointing. One example is that pronouns are all deictic. When I say 'I,' I'm referring to 'Gretchen.' I'm pointing to the 'I' that is me that is Gretchen."
84,66,Lauren,"That's really interesting because when I use 'I,' I use it to point to 'Lauren.'"
84,67,Gretchen,"Right. Same thing when I say 'you' -- well, in this context, I'm referring to 'you,' Lauren, but in fact, I do talk to other people also at other times, and sometimes 'you' refers to other people, also."
84,68,Lauren,Interesting. Because I use 'you' to refer to everyone who's listening to this episode.
84,69,Gretchen,"Well, I can also use 'you' for that. [Laughs] And same thing if I'm saying, 'Lauren, my co-host, she's done this,' or like, 'We, the co-hosts of Lingthusiasm,' all pronouns refer to things and people that are dependent on context. They're all pointing to someone or something that's in a particular space."
84,70,Lauren,"We have a whole episode on pronouns because unpacking what's happening with these little words that are pointing to different people and different things at any given time, there's a lot happening there that's really interesting."
84,71,Gretchen,"Sign languages also use a specific version of pointing when it comes to pronouns, right?"
84,72,Lauren,"Yeah, they make use of the fact that they are visual languages, and they make use of this human tendency to point. A lot of sign languages you'll see their pronoun system, the 'I' and the 'you' and the 'we,' is done through a kind of pointing. For example, Auslan and BSL, as the sign languages I know best, will use an index finger point. But even though it looks like an English pointing gesture that you'll commonly use as an English speaker, there are differences. There's this really nice study that a group of sign language researchers led by Jordan Fenlon and a bunch of gesture researchers -- again, Kensy Cooperrider's name comes up -- worked together to look at signed and spoken uses of pointing. You see these really consistent differences as well as these similarities. So, even though you see a lot of index pointing in both, for a signed language, the index finger tends to get used a lot more consistently. We talked before about how, as an English speaker, you might use a thumb to point behind you or an open hand. In a signed language, because it's a pronoun and it's part of the grammar, the form is much more consistent in how it's used, but it's also a little bit reduced. The index finger isn't always as extended. It's not held for as long. It's much more reduced because it is a part of the grammar that people are using all the time. It's this really nice thing that shows pointing and signed pronouns use the same resource but in slightly different ways."
84,73,Gretchen,"My favourite thing about pointing and signed pronouns is from a study in American Sign Language which studied these two d/Deaf children of d/Deaf parents. The study's from Laura Petitto. The kids are pointing to persons, objects, locations, all over the place, but then they go through this process where they're requiring specifically the pronominal points where you're pointing to yourself to mean 'me,' or you're pointing to someone else to mean 'you.' The kids, like how kids who are acquiring English and lots of other languages, sometimes acquire pronouns backwards."
84,74,Lauren,Yes.
84,75,Gretchen,"Sometimes, you'll get a kid who's like, 'You're tired,' and the kid'll be like, 'Yes, you're tired,' and they actually mean that 'Me, I'm tired.' They're tired."
84,76,Lauren,They haven't figured out that 'I' means 'Lauren' for me and 'Gretchen' for you. They just think 'you' is the reference for them.
84,77,Gretchen,"Right. It makes a lot of sense because they don't have that context to -- no one is actually saying, 'Okay, the thing you need to say is 'I'm tired'.' You just have to infer the --"
84,78,Lauren,They haven't figured out the pointing element of the pronouns.
84,79,Gretchen,The cool thing about this ASL study is that the kids do this same 'you' pointing reversal. They're making the pointing 'you' to refer to themselves.
84,80,Lauren,That is super nifty.
84,81,Gretchen,Isn't that cute?
84,82,Lauren,"I love that the research you cite also reinforces that pointing in signed languages is much more grammatical and like pronouns, but it is heaps cuter than the example that I had."
84,83,Gretchen,"It's very cute, but exactly, it reinforces how it's really grammaticalised because they're aware that when they're pointing to the dog or the cake or something that they're pointing to that object, but they interpret the 'you' point as grammaticalised to refer to themselves even though it's literally not pointing to themselves."
84,84,Lauren,"Huh, excellent. I'm so delighted there's a parallel."
84,85,Gretchen,It's the same ages as when hearing kids get this correct -- around 25-27 months.
84,86,Lauren,"Because, again, this deictic function that feels really simple, and we think of pronouns as a really basic thing that you acquire early in any language that you learn, is actually something that is, in terms of thinking and cognition, really, really hard."
84,87,Gretchen,"Right, exactly. Another really common type of deictic is words like 'this' and 'that' and 'here' and 'there.' If I say something like, 'Put that over there.'"
84,88,Lauren,"Uh, put what over where?"
84,89,Gretchen,"Exactly. Because these are contextual, you can't see what I'm pointing at. You can't see that I want you to pass me the cake."
84,90,Lauren,"Also, I'm not putting down this cup of tea quite yet."
84,91,Gretchen,"But I want this! And this highlights pronouns are basically inherently deictic, but there're lots of other categories of words that can be used deicticly or not. If we have an example like, 'I love this city.'"
84,92,Lauren,"I'm gonna assume you mean the city that you are currently in, which is actually not the same city that I'm in."
84,93,Gretchen,"Exactly. This requires knowledge of my current location. If I say, 'I went to this city one time, and I saw this amazing cat' or something, that's probably referring to a specific city, but it's not identifying it anywhere there. It's more like, 'I went to a city,' which doesn't identify it contextually."
84,94,Lauren,"In fact, I assume it's not the city you're currently in."
84,95,Gretchen,"In fact, it's true. If I'm telling an anecdote that way, 'I went to this city one time,' doesn't mean I went to THIS city one time."
84,96,Lauren,It would be very weird.
84,97,Gretchen,"English has basically two levels of closeness. We have 'this' and 'here,' which is something that's close to the speaker, and we have 'that' and 'there,' which is further from the speaker. But we used to have 'yon' and 'yonder.'"
84,98,Lauren,"Indeed, we did."
84,99,Gretchen,"'Peasant, fetch me yon book, and carry it yonder!' I feel like it's sort of olde-y time-y."
84,100,Lauren,"It definitely does sound olde-y time-y, and it means something that's not as close as 'here' and not as far as 'there.'"
84,101,Gretchen,"No, it's further. It means like, 'over there.'"
84,102,Lauren,"Oh, okay. It's so old I don't even have a sense of what it means."
84,103,Gretchen,"Right. 'Yon' and 'yonder' is like, 'over there,' which we still have, it just takes two words. But there're some languages like Spanish has 'esta' or 'esto,' which is close by, 'esa,' which is a medium distance -- sometimes the middle one is also used for stuff that's near the hearer or near the recipient -- and 'aquel, aquella,' which is like, 'over there,' sometimes also used for something that's neither close to the speaker nor the hearer."
84,104,Lauren,"Huh, useful. I love having more distinctions than 'here' and 'there.' I love it when I learn a language that has that."
84,105,Gretchen,"There's lots of these languages. Serbo-Croation has it -- Korean, Japanese -- Thai has it. Turkish has this three-way distinction."
84,106,Lauren,People from all kinds of language families realising you need more than a 'here' and a 'there.'
84,107,Gretchen,Right. And then there're a few languages that have even more fancy systems.
84,108,Lauren,"Ooo, excellent."
84,109,Gretchen,"Sinhala, which is an Indic language spoken in Sri Lanka, it has a four-way system -- near the speaker, near the addressee, close to a third person (visible), and then far from everybody (not visible). I dunno what you do with a complicated situation where you have something that's far from everybody, but it's still visible, or visible but close to -- you know."
84,110,Lauren,I'm sure someone has a very good experiment you could use to tease out those distinctions.
84,111,Gretchen,"But there is a four-way distinction that gets further and further away. Then Malagasy, which is an Austronesian language spoken in Madagascar, has a seven degree of distance system."
84,112,Lauren,"Ooo, how satisfying."
84,113,Gretchen,"Plus, two degrees of visibility."
84,114,Lauren,"So good. Do you think it has anything to do with the fact that Malagasy is right near Africa, but it's actually an Austronesian language, most of which is spoken in Asia? Do you think that they just needed all those distances to account for how far --"
84,115,Gretchen,To refer to their distant cousins over in the Philippines and Indonesia and places like that?
84,116,Lauren,Yeah. [Laughs] I do not think this hypothesis is gonna hold up.
84,117,Gretchen,"I don't think so. But you know, they did have a very sophisticated navigational system by the stars. I don't think this is also a reason why."
84,118,Lauren,I think Austronesian languages do have a good tendency towards nice systems of distance like this.
84,119,Gretchen,"There are tons of Austronesian languages, and it seems like a lot of them have relatively interesting deixis systems which have lots of different levels. That's neat."
84,120,Lauren,"Excellent. Spatial systems are really handy because they show us something important about deixis, and it's where the pointing is happening from. For something like Sinhala, the fact that you have something that is the speaker versus something near the addressee or near to a third person, it means that the centre of where the deixis is happening from is different in all of those contexts."
84,121,Gretchen,"This shows up a lot when we're talking about prepositions and how they're deictic. A lot of prepositions like 'near' and 'far' -- so if I say, 'Oh, yeah, I'm going to go get some bubble tea. It's right nearby,' you're like, 'Gretchen, that's not near me at all. I live on the other side of the world from you.'"
84,122,Lauren,"That's because we're treating you as the deictic centre, and Canada is a long way from Australia. The deictic centre shifts depending on who is speaking because that's how pointing works."
84,123,Gretchen,"And if we're saying something like 'across,' like if I say, 'The library is across the street,' by default that means it's across the street from me. But I could also shift, if I'm talking about maybe we're gonna make plans later, and I say, 'Well, it's great because the library is just across the street from the restaurant,' and then we're shifting the deictic centre to the restaurant even if I'm currently on the same side of the library or something like that."
84,124,Lauren,"Again, once you begin to pull apart what's happening with deixis, you realise just how much brain space is going to making sure that you understand what's being pointed to, what the deictic centre is."
84,125,Gretchen,"Yeah. What's being pointed to and from where, which is the deictic centre. Or if you say something like, 'The dog is in front of the house,' now you're taking the perspective of the house. Houses seem to have an intrinsic front to them, or at least we feel like a house has a front to it. So, the house is the deictic centre. But if I say, 'The dog's in front of the tree,' and trees don't really have an intrinsic front, now I'm probably referring to my position in terms of someone who's looking at the dog."
84,126,Lauren,"The problem is that trees don't have front doors, and that is a problem with trees. [Laughter]"
84,127,Gretchen,Okay. There are some verbs that are deictic -- just to keep going down our list of parts of speech.
84,128,Lauren,"Okay, yeah. Lots of different parts of speech can be deictic. What are some deictic verbs?"
84,129,Gretchen,"The biggest ones are 'go' and 'come.' If I say, 'I'm going to Australia,' that's my deictic centre in Canada where I'm like, 'This is a thing that I am heading away from my perspective.' But I could also say, 'I'm coming to visit you in Australia,' and then I'm taking on your perspective and saying, 'Oh, from your perspective it would be 'coming,' and therefore, I can say it in that way.'"
84,130,Lauren,That's true.
84,131,Gretchen,"Similarly, with 'I'm coming home now,' I'm projecting my deictic centre onto whoever I'm talking to."
84,132,Lauren,"Oh, 'home' is a good one because 'home' varies depending on who is talking and also the size of what is 'home.' If I was meeting someone at a bubble tea place, saying, 'I'm going home now' would mean to my specific residential address. But if I had come to Canada and was going home, 'home' would be Melbourne or the whole of Australia."
84,133,Gretchen,"Right. When you're travelling, sometimes your friend's house that you're staying with or your hotel room or something, you're like, 'Oh, I'm gonna go home for a nap,' and that can just mean wherever you're sleeping that night."
84,134,Lauren,"You're going all the way back to Canada just for a nap, and then coming back to Australia in the morning? Wow. That is dedication. Yeah, that is true. 'Home' is really quite portable sometimes."
84,135,Gretchen,"I also really like when you hear people's voicemail. I don't know how often people are leaving voicemail messages anymore, but on their voicemail, they'll often say something like, 'I'm not here. Please leave a message.' But sort of by definition, anywhere that you are currently right now is 'here' for you. So, saying, 'I'm not here,' means 'I won't be here when you're calling me to have received this because, definitionally, if were here, I would've picked up, but because I haven't picked up, I'm not here at the time that you're listening to it, even though wherever I am is 'here' when you're saying it.' I can see why people don't actually leave this as their voicemail message recording."
84,136,Lauren,"I feel like this almost made sense back in the old days where you physically recorded onto a tape that had a specific location, but now people's voicemail is connected to an inbox on the internet on a mobile phone. What even is 'here'?"
84,137,Gretchen,"What is 'here'? I don't know, but you can also use deixis to talk about time."
84,138,Lauren,"What even is time? I was thinking about this at the top of the episode because we always say, 'Today, we're talking about,' and indeed, we are talking about this 'today,' the day that we're recording this, and you are --"
84,139,Gretchen,"Definitionally, at the moment of recording, that moment is 'today,' yes."
84,140,Lauren,You are absolutely listening to this 'today' as it's being listened to or that you're reading it as a transcript. But they're two different 'todays.'
84,141,Gretchen,"They are two different 'todays.' I was very conscious about this when I was writing Because Internet, which is a book that I wrote about language on the internet, because I'd read a lot of other books and articles about things to do with the internet, and a lot of them would say things like 'now' or 'currently' or 'modern.' So, you read something like, 'MySpace is very cool now,' and you flip to the copyright page, and you go, 'Ah, this came out in 2006.'"
84,142,Lauren,"Oh, wow. Hmm, yes."
84,143,Gretchen,"I was trying to be more specific and say, 'This is cool in the early 21st Century' or 'This is cool in the 2010s' or 'This is what people were doing in the '90s' or various eras rather than saying 'now' because I was very conscious that people would, hopefully, read this book from the future and go, 'Oh, no, we don't do that anymore,' and I wouldn't be able to predict which of those things would be the case."
84,144,Lauren,"Very aware of what 'now' means. Thinking of the internet also reminds me of just how terrible it was when MySpace was cool now because MySpace -- the 'my' in 'MySpace' is a deictic pronoun. You'd have to be like, 'Uh, follow my MySpace' or 'What's your MySpace?' 'Do you have a YourSpace?' It was very tough."
84,145,Gretchen,"There's a lot of these that are named 'My Something,' and you can see how you would do this as a user design, and yet, as an actual user, you're like, 'No, this is very frustrating that I have 'My Courses' or 'My Account' or 'My Network',' and you're like, 'Okay, log on to your 'My Network'.'"
84,146,Lauren,"I feel like I've seen both things like 'My bank' and 'Your bank' because it depends on how the people setting up and naming the system thought about it while they were creating it. They are terrible to call up and ask for help with. It's like, 'I'm having trouble logging into my 'Your Bank'.'"
84,147,Gretchen,"It's like, 'Is the bank talking to me, or am I talking to the bank?' Either way, maybe we could just not put something deictic in the name of this product and all of our problems would be solved."
84,148,Lauren,The problem with affixing a deictic centre to a name that then is actually a shifting centre causing all kinds of deictic anxiety.
84,149,Gretchen,"I think time deixis is especially prone to this issue if you're talking about something like 'now' or 'soon' or 'then,' 'yesterday,' 'today,' 'tomorrow.' You can see why we use them because it is super useful to mean 'the day that is currently' -- and you and I have timezone issues a lot of the time because we obviously live different timezones, and so we actually use deictic time more than absolute time because it's easier to say, 'Do you wanna talk in an hour?' and we can both just add an hour to whatever our current time is rather than 'Do you wanna talk at 7 o'clock?' and we're like, 'Oh, I dunno what time it is for you.'"
84,150,Lauren,"Well, even 'today' becomes a problem because we're across the international dateline, so my 'today' is often your 'tomorrow' -- yeah, I have to think about this really hard."
84,151,Gretchen,"In fact, when we're recording an episode on both of our 'todays,' we are in fact recording it on different days, even though they're 'today' for both of us."
84,152,Lauren,True. There is actually almost never a single 'today' for an episode of Lingthusiasm.
84,153,Gretchen,"This gets us into the gigantic 'this next' problem, which I feel like makes its way around popular discourse every couple months. If I say, 'When is next Monday?'"
84,154,Lauren,"'Next Monday' is three days away for me right now. So, I would say 'next Monday' is the one that's three days away. But if you ask me when 'next Saturday' is, I don't think it's tomorrow. I think it's the one that's eight days away."
84,155,Gretchen,"Sometimes, people use 'next' to be the one that wraps around to another week, so by Monday, it'll be another week, but 'next Monday' and 'this Monday' for me are currently the same day. But because it's Thursday for me right now, 'this Friday' and 'next Friday' are currently days because 'this' doesn't wrap around the week. It's always the closest one. 'Next' wraps around the week, but it could still be the closest one if that closest one has wrapped around the week."
84,156,Lauren,I have just taken to never using 'next' as a day of the week unless I've absolutely clarified the absolute day of the month as well.
84,157,Gretchen,"There's the same problem with like 'last May,' like, when does 'this summer' become 'last summer,' or if it's only October, is 'last summer' the one that happened two months ago, or is 'last summer' the one that happened a year and two months ago?"
84,158,Lauren,"Again, the seasons one -- made even harder by the fact we don't even share a hemisphere. So, we can't even point to the same season at the same time."
84,159,Gretchen,"You know, the English language was truly not designed for instantaneous communication across literally the entire globe."
84,160,Lauren,Or writing. All of the deictic time and deictic location in writing. We should just abolish writing and distance communication. That will make deixis so much easier.
84,161,Gretchen,"[laughing] This sounds like a terrible world, and I don't wanna live in it."
84,162,Lauren,You're right.
84,163,Gretchen,We need to evolve a more fanciful and elaborate type of deixis that works around the world and in writing and in lots of time zones.
84,164,Lauren,It is a testament to human cognition that we are able to do deixis when we have deictic centres split across days and across places and across times in this way.
84,165,Gretchen,"The other thing that I was thinking about with deixis is like, 'Okay, nouns can be deictic. Verbs can be deictic. Adverbs can be deictic. Pronouns can be deictic.' You have a sentence like, 'The cat is purring.' The 'the' there also picks out a specific cat in a way that's context-dependent. My idea of what a cat is is based on my history as someone who has had a lot of cats pointed out to them. Is meaning just deixis all the way down? Everything you just learned through a combination of things that were pointed to?"
84,166,Lauren,"I mean, yeah. I think maybe it is."
84,167,Gretchen,"I find this a fun and interesting way of thinking about meaning because the way that I think we're sometimes introduced to meaning in a formal context is through dictionary definitions that give you a description of a cat that says something like, 'A cat is a furry creature with four legs, a long tail, purrs,' whatever other attributes you wanna assign to a cat. But in practice, I didn't learn the word 'cat' by looking it up in a dictionary or having a description provided to me. I learned the word 'cat' by having a bunch of cats pointed out to me. Sometimes, a cat has three legs or is one of those weird hairless cats."
84,168,Lauren,"I've never looked at a Manx cat and gone, 'That cannot be a cat. It doesn't have a tail.'"
84,169,Gretchen,"Right, exactly. You could say, 'Okay, they all have cat DNA,' but I have petted so many cats in my life, and I have never done a DNA test before I'm like, 'Ooo, kitty!'"
84,170,Lauren,"Oh, yeah, I said to my neighbour, I was like, 'I'm not gonna feed your cat until I get a DNA test to prove it's definitely a cat. Then I'll feed it.'"
84,171,Gretchen,That's not how meaning works. It's not like humans couldn't talk about cats before they had DNA tests.
84,172,Lauren,Yeah.
84,173,Gretchen,"We did a whole bonus episode about meaning and the ways that we interact with it talking about the 'Is a pizza a sandwich?' meme, which I would highly recommend because I think it's a very fun bonus episode. It turns out that this is actually how meaning works for most people in context. You see a bunch of examples of cats or birds or chairs or whatever. You come up with a sense of what's in the cluster based on generalising from those examples rather than by having an exact list of parameters because some stuff is an exception to those parameters, and it's still a point in the cluster."
84,174,Lauren,Absolutely. Especially for things where we can point to examples of them in the world.
84,175,Gretchen,"One of my favourite responses after we put that 'Is X a sandwich?' episode up was someone saying, 'You know, this makes me feel a lot better about not having a really clear definition for what it means to feel like a woman.' Because it turns out all words work like this if you look at them long enough. It's less like a list of criteria and more like situating yourself within a constellation of other points. You just meet a bunch of women over the course of your life, and you're like, 'Do I want people to say 'woman' when they refer to me also? Yeah, okay.'"
84,176,Lauren,"Yeah. I mean, both 'Yeah, that's how I feel about being a woman' and 'Yeah, language is all about pointing towards meaning.'"
84,177,Gretchen,It's pointing all the way down.
84,178,Lauren,"Gretchen, can I finish by telling you one of my favourite jokes about deixis?"
84,179,Gretchen,"You have a joke about deixis? Okay, I absolutely need to hear it."
84,180,Lauren,Two linguists walk into a bar. Which one is the expert on deixis?
84,181,Gretchen,I dunno. Which one?
84,182,Lauren,This one.
84,183,Gretchen,"Lauren, once again, this is audio."
84,184,Lauren,"Ah, well, that's okay, because now we're at the end of this episode, I'm pointing to everyone. [Music]"
