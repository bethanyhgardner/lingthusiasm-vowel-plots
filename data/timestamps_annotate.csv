There is something that everyone who gestures does all the time. It has a specific technical name. That is the repetition in a gesture to indicate duration or emphasis. This kind of repetition is known as a 'beat' gesture. You will absolutely see it in the most clearest manifestation if you watch a politician give a speech because they love to use them to give a sense of coherence to what they're saying.

u,blue,Lauren,3,5,57,"Yeah, there's a professional vocabulary distinction to be made there as well. I do remember reading something, and again we're into uncited anec-data here, but I do remember reading something that said professionals can discriminate with more lexical items and words, like technical words, but it doesn't necessarily mean they see more colours than people who don't have these professional words. So you might give people colour chips and one is magenta and one is russet, and people might say well they're both within red. And someone who does fabric work will know that's magenta and that's russet someone who doesn't have to discriminate will be like well this one's rustier and this one's richer red, and so they can still see the difference. It's not like not having the word prevents you. And you know, people who I'm friends with in Nepal who predominantly speak a language that doesn't have a blue-green distinction, they still see the distinction, they still prefer fabric in one colour over another one. So we're not saying anything about it affecting the way people literally see colour. I'm also going to put a link in the show notes to Randall Munroe of XKCD's colour survey from 2010. Results relatively similar to those found by Rich in the seventies except he had a few more data points. He had people labelling colours on their computers, so there's a monitor effect here, but he had almost a quarter of a million users logged on to label five million colours. So a few more data points there. There's more distinction for some colours among people who have identified in the survey as female compared to those who identify as male. It was the same set of focus colours though, so you know everyone agreed that red was red and pink was pink in the brightest shades of those, and everyone agreed that no one can spell 'fuchsia'.

u,blue,Lauren,5,5,15,"I have, conveniently, two languages that I've learnt at two point in my life illustrate this really neatly.

And my Italian teacher was like 'meeeeh that's a fine... I mean, I understand what you mean but the person actually has occhi azzurro'. Or there's probably an adjective conjugation there that I need to do that I haven't done but for eyes for this Italian teacher you don't use the word 'blu' you use the word 'azzurro'. And people have argued that Italian actually has two basic colour words for what we think of as blue and 'blu' covers everything that's like royal blue and really rich blues and darker and azzurro is like light blue and sky blue. So I didn't really get it as an eleven-year-old and it's still hard for me to think of this, but then when I started learning Yolmo, which is a Tibetan language spoken in Nepal, they have one word for blue but that word also includes most of what we think of as green.

A lot of sign languages you'll see their pronoun system, the 'I' and the 'you' and the 'we,' is done through a kind of pointing. For example, Auslan and BSL, as the sign languages I know best, will use an index finger point. But even though it looks like an English pointing gesture that you'll commonly use as an English speaker, there are differences. There's this really nice study that a group of sign language researchers led by Jordan Fenlon and a bunch of gesture researchers -- again, Kensy Cooperrider's name comes up -- worked together to look at signed and spoken uses of pointing. You see these really consistent differences as well as these similarities. So, even though you see a lot of index pointing in both, for a signed language, the index finger tends to get used a lot more consistently. We talked before about how, as an English speaker, you might use a thumb to point behind you or an open hand. In a signed language, because it's a pronoun and it's part of the grammar, the form is much more consistent in how it's used, but it's also a little bit reduced. The index finger isn't always as extended. It's not held for as long. It's much more reduced because it is a part of the grammar that people are using all the time.

Dixon, and he talks about languages evolving in a cycle from having a lot of individual words to kind of glomming those words onto each other a little bit to having these long words with lots of bits glommed on, and then keep going around. So you can put languages with lots of bits glommed on at twelve o'clock on a clock, you can put the languages with lots of individual words at four o'clock, and you can put the languages where the individual bits have started to stick together again at eight o'clock.

But there are actually some domains where adults have an advantage or older speakers, older children even, have an advantage. And so children tend to be better at the phonology side, so they're going to learn the sounds, the subtle distinctions, because that's all they're being exposed to and they have that capability. But it takes a long time for kids to learn a significant amount of vocabulary or grammar. Like, if you think about a baby, right, a baby gets exposed to a language. And as many hours in a day as it's awake, for a whole year, generally, before it even says a single word. Like if you gave an adult that kind of exposure, if you had them literally only being exposed to that language and you're like, 'Yeah, we don't really expect me to talk for a whole year,' that's just not what our expectations are when it comes to adults. And the fact that an adult can walk out of an hour-long class and have half a dozen words that they pretty much know, even if they have forgotten half of them by next week, that's still six words that they've learned, and the baby takes like a year and a half to learn that.","enerally, before it even says a single word.

Ê,put,Lauren,5,5,57,"Yeah, there's a professional vocabulary distinction to be made there as well. I do remember reading something, and again we're into uncited anec-data here, but I do remember reading something that said professionals can discriminate with more lexical items and words, like technical words, but it doesn't necessarily mean they see more colours than people who don't have these professional words. So you might give people colour chips and one is magenta and one is russet, and people might say well they're both within red. And someone who does fabric work will know that's magenta and that's russet someone who doesn't have to discriminate will be like well this one's rustier and this one's richer red, and so they can still see the difference. It's not like not having the word prevents you. And you know, people who I'm friends with in Nepal who predominantly speak a language that doesn't have a blue-green distinction, they still see the distinction, they still prefer fabric in one colour over another one. So we're not saying anything about it affecting the way people literally see colour. I'm also going to put a link in the show notes to Randall Munroe of XKCD's colour survey from 2010. Results relatively similar to those found by Rich in the seventies except he had a few more data points. He had people labelling colours on their computers, so there's a monitor effect here, but he had almost a quarter of a million users logged on to label five million colours. So a few more data points there. There's more distinction for some colours among people who have identified in the survey as female compared to those who identify as male. It was the same set of focus colours though, so you know everyone agreed that red was red and pink was pink in the brightest shades of those, and everyone agreed that no one can spell 'fuchsia'. So it was a pretty successful study.",olour. I'm also going to put a link in the show no,I'm also going to put a link in the show,1339280.0,1340449.0
Ê,another,Gretchen,1,3,96,"And it can be quite subtle. One example of something that has been shown for weak versions of linguistic relativity is that if your language says that two particular shades are part of the same colour, you'll tend to treat them similarly whereas if it says that they're part of different colours then you'll treat them differently. So if your language has different words for light blue and dark blue. Which English doesn't, but Russian does and Italian does, you'll tend to treat those two colours as different -- the way English-speakers treat pink and red as different colours. I don't think it means that we're physically incapable of perceiving the difference between different reds, because obviously we do this all the time. It's just that it kind of facilitates our thinking in a particular direction, because we're used to associating one group of things versus another group of things. So the linguistic relativity effects that you get tend to be very small and tend to be in the direction of other types of cultural associations and cultural priming. So there's an analogy that John McWhorter uses, which is if you feel more serious in a tuxedo than you feel in a clown suit, that doesn't mean that the clown suit is affecting your thoughts. It means you have these associations with what wearing a red nose and big shoes and like a multicoloured wig is, that are different from your associations with wearing a tuxedo.",e group of things versus another group of things. ,group of things versus another group of things.,1322190.0,1323749.0
