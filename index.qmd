title: "Lingthusiasm Vowel Plots"

This is the tutorial website for the Lingthusiasm bonus episode about making vowel plots. I took data from the Lingthusiasm episode recordings and from a recording of the Wells Lexical Set that Gretchen and Lauren made for me:

And made stylized versions of the Wells Lexical Set:

And of the Lingthusiasm episode data:

[Part 1](1_find_words.qmd) of the tutorial finds the vowel data to use, [Part 2](2_annotate_audio.qmd) annotates F1 and F2 in the vowel data, and [Part 3](3_plot_vowels.qmd) explains how vowel plots work and makes several versions.

If you use this tutorial to make your own plots, I'd love to see them!
